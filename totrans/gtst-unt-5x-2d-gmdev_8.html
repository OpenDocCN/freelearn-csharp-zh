</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>In the first part of the chapter, we will present a series of ideas on how to improve your game. Some of these sections have already been anticipated in previous chapters. In order to have these sections explained in detail, and by also showing the code, we would have required much more time and space, which we unfortunately don't have. Therefore, you need to consider these sections as exercises. In fact, this is the only chapter in which the <span class="emphasis"><em>Homework</em></span> section is not present (although there are some explicit exercises). Please, feel free to expand and implement what captures your interest most. After all, nothing can teach you better than experience, and trial and error!</p><p>Later in the chapter, we will discover what's beyond the cake. In fact, game development is not limited to the game itself; there are many things built around that you should consider. These things may include, teamwork, playtesting, marketing, and localization! Of course, this is not a book about video game marketing, but it provides some ground to start to go beyond the mere game!</p><p>Finally, I have to say that you should congratulate yourself since you have reached this far! In fact, not only have you finished a <span class="emphasis"><em>Tower Defense</em></span> game and learnt a lot about Unity, but also you are still here, standing for the last chapter! So, to keep yourself motivated, go and grab a slice of cake before continuing to read this last chapter.</p><div class="section" title="Enhancing and improving your game"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec91"/>Enhancing and improving your game</h1></div></div></div><p>The aim of this section is to give you an idea of the potentiality of your game and a direction to work toward. After all, if you have reached this far, you will also be able to walk by yourself, and so I won't explain everything in detail.</p><div class="section" title="Improving cupcake towers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec107"/>Improving cupcake towers</h2></div></div></div><p>Here we will focus on how we can improve our cupcake towers by exploring some ideas and new directions, such as shooting policies or a special kind of sprinkles.</p><div class="section" title="Shooting policies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec70"/>Shooting policies</h3></div></div></div><p>Back in <a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Baking Cupcake Towers" href="part0028.xhtml#aid-QMFO1">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Baking Cupcake Towers</em></span>, we implemented the first cupcake tower that shot the Panda closest to the tower. However, this is not the only policy that you can pick. Actually, you can also allow the player to pick one that suits better for his/her strategy.</p><p>These policies may include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Shoot the weaker/stronger Panda</li><li class="listitem">Shoot the Panda with less/more health</li><li class="listitem">Shoot the furthest Panda within the range</li><li class="listitem">Shoot the first/last Panda that enters in the range</li></ul></div><p>Feel free to add more and implement your own.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip108"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>How to implement these</strong></span>:</p><p>In <code class="literal">CupcakeTowerScript</code>, we loop over all the Pandas (actually colliders, but we filter them by tag). We have found and calculated the distance from each one of them. Some concepts can be applied with the preceding list. In the case of the furthest Panda, this is immediate, because instead of having the <code class="literal">min</code> variable, you can have a <code class="literal">max</code> variable. The same holds true for weaker/stronger and with less/more health Pandas, in which you still need to have a <code class="literal">min</code> or <code class="literal">max</code> variable, but instead of the distance, you take some properties from the <code class="literal">PandaScript</code>. The case in which we are searching the first or last Panda that has entered the range is a bit trickier. In fact, you need to have a data structure for the Pandas that enters and exits from the range, and then retrieve the Panda to shoot from this structure.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Special sprinkles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec71"/>Special sprinkles</h3></div></div></div><p>In our game, all of the sprinkles just have a damage and a speed, which can be set by the Cupcake towers that shoots them. However, you can have more types of sprinkles, and some of them can have special effects.</p><p>Some examples of these effects might be the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Freeze</strong></span>: A probability to slow down the enemy for a limited period of time.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Poison</strong></span>: A probability to poison the Panda; that will decrease its health over time (usually within a short period of time).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Explosive</strong></span>: They don't damage only the Panda that they hit, but also surrounding Pandas.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Critical hit</strong></span>: A probability that the sprinkle could kill the Panda regardless of its remaining life. But for instance, it is not applicable for bosses, which in a critical hit just receive double the damage.</li></ul></div><p>Feel free to add your own.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip109"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>How to implement these</strong></span>:</p><p>You can create special sprinkle classes that derive from the <code class="literal">ProjectileScript</code> class by using inheritance. This derivative class can contain additional data about their effects. In <code class="literal">PandaScript</code>, you can retrieve in the <code class="literal">OnTriggerEnter2D()</code> function which kind of sprinkle hit the Panda, so as to retrieve its information and apply an effect to the Panda.</p><p>In the case of the explosive effect, the Panda that was hit should use the <code class="literal">Physics2D.OverlapCircleAll()</code> function (as in <code class="literal">CupcakeTowerScript</code>) to find nearby Pandas.</p></div><p>Moreover, you can animate them so that they have nice and smooth animation. Even just a rotation animation could be awesome to see.</p></div><div class="section" title="Aging and pricing model"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec72"/>Aging and pricing model</h3></div></div></div><p>Who said that a tower cannot get old? Given that a Cupcake tower is shooting at Pandas continually from its creation, it might be subjected to usury. As such, its performance may decrease over time and also its value if the player tries to sell it.</p><p>You can add another trading option to repair a cupcake tower and get it back to work as it should.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip110"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>How to implement this</strong></span>:</p><p>You can implement a coroutine within <code class="literal">CupcakeTowerScript</code> that after a fixed amount of time, it ages the tower, by lowering its stats, eventually until it stops to work. If you also want to implement a repair functionality, you need to store the original values of the tower somewhere in order to restore them after the repairing option.</p></div><p>Besides aging, what about the various prices and costs that change over time dynamically? Ideally, you would like to create a real pricing model for that (which takes a lot of design efforts), but it would be greatly appreciated once it works. In fact, it's something to take into consideration when you balance your game.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip111"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>How to implement this</strong></span>:</p><p>Again, you can create a coroutine within <code class="literal">CupcakeTowerScript</code> that, based on the current state of the tower (and potentially of the game), changes its costs. As a result, when the trading system fetches these values, they are updated based on your model price.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Improving the user interface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec108"/>Improving the user interface</h2></div></div></div><p>Also, the user interface of our game can be improved, for instance, a notification indicating to the player how many waves he/she has still to defeat. Adding this kind of information can be extremely useful. The next step is then to determine, where?. This is another design choice that should be taken into account, because it might affect the balance we reached when we designed the current UI back in <a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Communicating with the Player – the User Interface" href="part0043.xhtml#aid-190861">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Communicating with the Player – the User Interface</em></span>.</p><p>So a good exercise would be to iterate the design of the whole interface of the game by taking into account as many things as possible (including showing the prices and costs in the trading system; there was an exercise on this in the previous chapter).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note112"/>Note</h3><p>A really good book on how to design user interfaces is <span class="emphasis"><em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em></span> by Jeff Johnson, but this is just one of many, so be sure to check out other more specific books about UI in video games.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Improving levels"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec109"/>Improving levels</h2></div></div></div><p>Here we will focus on things we can do to improve our levels. As for the cupcake towers in the previous section, we will explore new ideas and directions, such as including more levels, enemies, and paths to follow.</p><div class="section" title="Multilevel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec73"/>Multilevel</h3></div></div></div><p>Of course, your game must contain more than one level! We have implemented only one level, but you should definitely expand your game to more than one.</p><p>At this stage, you are able to create your own map and level. But here are a few hints and considerations that you might find useful:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Remember that static variables are persistent. Therefore, they need to be reassigned with the correct values when you change the scene.</li><li class="listitem">You can make some objects persistent between scenes by using the <code class="literal">DontDestroyOnLoad()</code> function (useful when you need to implement music; we will see this in <span class="emphasis"><em>Audio</em></span> section).</li><li class="listitem">You have to take designing choices, such as: is the sugar collected by the player preserved among levels? And his/her health?</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Large maps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec74"/>Large maps</h3></div></div></div><p>We can implement very large maps in the game, so large that they cannot be displayed all at once on the screen. In this way, we need to implement a way that the user can move the camera so as to move the level (or you can also implement that the camera is fixed, and all the rest moves).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip113"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>How to implement this</strong></span>:</p><p>Attached to the camera, you can create a script, which detects when the player drags the mouse, so as to move the camera in the opposite direction (left drag, camera moves right).</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Many paths"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec75"/>Many paths</h3></div></div></div><p>Nothing prevents us from creating a map where the path for the Pandas at a certain point splits or merges with other paths. We can even have more spawning points, or more than one way of access to the cake.</p><p>All of this can be taken care of by our waypoint system. In fact, the Pandas call the <code class="literal">GetNextWaypoint()</code> function, which can return any waypoint in the map.</p><p>As such, you can create many different waypoints that inherit from the parent class of waypoint. In the case of a split, you can randomly choose where to send the Panda. Here is a fragment of code to give you an example when the path splits in two:</p><pre class="programlisting">[SerializeField] &#13;
private Waypoint waypoint1, waypoint2; &#13;
 &#13;
public override Waypoint GetNextWaypoint() { &#13;
  if(Random.Range(0,2) == 0) { &#13;
    return waypoint1; &#13;
  }else { &#13;
    return waypoint2; &#13;
  } &#13;
} &#13;
</pre><p>But you can really implement whatever you have in mind as far as you reason in terms of waypoints! You can also make <code class="literal">GetNextWaypoint()</code> accept some parameter, such as the Panda itself, and based on the Panda also decide on which waypoint to send the Panda! Basically the possibilities are many, and the structure to have waypoints as single entities allows us to do this kind of stuff.</p></div><div class="section" title="Many Pandas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec76"/>Many Pandas</h3></div></div></div><p>We cannot limit ourselves to just one type of Panda! We can make green, red, and purple Pandas too! Each one of them can have different stats. For instance, some are really slow, have a lot of health, and do eat a lot of cake. Others are really fast, have low health, and eat just a moderate bite of the player's cake when they reach it.</p><p>You might even think about giving them different abilities, and again you can use the concept of inheritance to implement other Panda classes that derive from the <code class="literal">PandaScript</code>. However, remember to keep in mind that you also need to change the spawning system!</p></div><div class="section" title="Multiphase bosses"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec77"/>Multiphase bosses</h3></div></div></div><p>Among the different kinds of Pandas, you can add at the end of the level a boss to defeat a giant Panda with a crown on its head:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00608.jpeg" alt="Multiphase bosses"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>The different phases of the boss can be structured with a finite state machine, and the different transitions triggered by the amount of its health or how close it is to the player's cake. It might also have the possibility to get really angry and go off the track to eat a cupcake tower!</p></div><div class="section" title="A better spawning system"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec78"/>A better spawning system</h3></div></div></div><p>Since we added so many different kinds of Pandas, we need to restructure our spawning system. Ideally you want to find a solution easier for designers to show in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> an array with the different waves, and for each wave how many enemies of one kind and how many enemies of another kind, like this image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00609.jpeg" alt="A better spawning system"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>You may be wondering whether this can really be done in the Unity Inspector. The answer is yes; in fact, the Unity Editor can be extended (we will see later in this chapter).</p></div><div class="section" title="Switching difficulty at runtime"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec79"/>Switching difficulty at runtime</h3></div></div></div><p>Another great way to adapt the game to a large audience might be to switch the difficulty of the game at runtime, based on the player's performance. In fact, you may want to keep players who seek challenges engaged by increasing the level of difficulty if they are progressing relatively easily through the game, or help players that are struggling.</p><p>There are different ways to do it. The simplest one includes if-chains, based on the player's score to increase or decrease the difficulty; whereas the most complex ones include adaptive learning algorithms.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip114"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>How to implement this</strong></span>:</p><p>Whichever your way is, the first thing to do is to link your entire game to a difficulty parameter, maybe within the <code class="literal">Game Manager</code>. Whenever, this parameter is changed, all the parts of the game dependent on it change (refer the <span class="emphasis"><em>More about communication between scripts</em></span> section). Then on a separate script, you can implement your adaptive algorithm, which, fed with the different states of the game, can determine whether to increase or decrease the difficulty.</p></div></div></div></div></div>

So keep in mind the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Increase the readability of your code through documentation (we will see later in <span class="emphasis"><em>Teamwork</em></span> section) for your programmer's colleagues.</li><li class="listitem">Make a nice interface in the Inspector (also by using custom inspectors; see later) so that it is easy to use by designers (an example is exposing events, which we are going to explore in the next section).</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Exposing events"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec111"/>Exposing events</h2></div></div></div><p>If you are programming a very cool script that needs to interact with other elements in the game, you can actually expose your own event in your scripts.</p><p>In fact, you can add this library to your code:</p><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine.Events; &#13;
</pre><p>As a result, you will be able declare and trigger events in the following way:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Float variable just for test. Can be set in the Inspector.</em></span> &#13;
public float myFloat; &#13;
 &#13;
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Declaration of the event class. It has a float as parameter to pass.</em></span> &#13;
[System.Serializable] &#13;
public class OnEveryFrame : UnityEvent&lt;float&gt; { } &#13;
 &#13;
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Declare the variable event which will be shown in the Inspector</em></span> &#13;
public OnEveryFrame OnEveryFrameEvent; &#13;
 &#13;
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Function that is called every frame</em></span> &#13;
void Update() { &#13;
 <span class="emphasis"><em> //fire the event at every frame</em></span> &#13;
  OnEveryFrameEvent.Invoke(myFloat); &#13;
} &#13;
</pre><p>This is how it appears in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00610.jpeg" alt="Exposing events"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Cool, isn't' it?</p></div><div class="section" title="Sprinkles pooling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec112"/>Sprinkles pooling</h2></div></div></div><p>Instantiating a game object in Unity is a slow operation; as such, every time the cupcake tower shoots, a new sprinkle is instantiated and then removed from the game.</p><p>A much better solution would be to do object pooling, which is an optimization technique (we anticipated something about this in <a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Baking Cupcake Towers" href="part0028.xhtml#aid-QMFO1">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Baking Cupcake Towers</em></span>). The concept is to instantiate a fixed number of sprinkles at the beginning and keep them off-screen. When a cupcake tower shoots a sprinkle, it just takes a sprinkle from this pool and shoots that. When the sprinkle is supposed to be destroyed, instead, it is moved back into the pool off-screen so that it can be picked again by another tower.</p><p>In a scenario where there are many towers shooting, this can dramatically improve the performance of your game, especially if you are targeting a mobile platform.</p></div><div class="section" title="Saving your data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec113"/>Saving your data</h2></div></div></div><p>We haven't discussed saving the data for the game (unfortunately we couldn't cover everything in this book). However, Unity offers a class called <code class="literal">PlayerPrefs</code> (official documentation: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html</a>), which is great to save some values between sessions of your game, such as the score.</p><p>If you need to save many things, you should implement your own solution by saving your own file. What format to use for the file is up to you. Unity offers built-in support for XML since many versions, and just recently Unity has also included built-in support for JSON files.</p><p>Lastly, you should also consider saving data to the cloud, such as on an online database.</p></div><div class="section" title="Debugging"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec114"/>Debugging</h2></div></div></div><p>Bugs are nasty to fix, but you have a very powerful ally: the console. Don't underestimate the value of this tool. This is because it will save you from many situations, and although at the beginning it could seem that what it is logging doesn't make sense, with time you will learn how to interpret those messages and correct bugs fast.</p><p>Another great way to use the console is by inserting debug logs. In Unity, they can be printed with the <code class="literal">Debug</code> class. Here is an example:</p><pre class="programlisting">Debug.Log("This is a string that will be printed on the console"); &#13;
</pre><p>Placing this line of code in strategic places can help you identify the bug and eventually correct it.</p><div class="section" title="Remote Logs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec80"/>Remote Logs</h3></div></div></div><p>Unity offers the possibility to use your powerful ally (the console) remotely if you are targeting another platform. For instance, for Android devices, you can read this (which actually allows you to have not only the console by using an ADB connection but also a debugger):</p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AttachingMonoDevelopDebuggerToAnAndroidDevice.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AttachingMonoDevelopDebuggerToAnAndroidDevice.html</a></p><p>Otherwise, you can implement your own solution to show console logs or check out code written by other people. For instance, you may want to give this free asset a look:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/12294">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/12294</a></p></div><div class="section" title="Cleaning the release version"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec81"/>Cleaning the release version</h3></div></div></div><p>However, you should remember to remove these lines of code from the final version; otherwise, they consume computational power that you could've used in another way.</p><p>A great way to deal with debug statements is to create another class that prints a debug message. If you include the <code class="literal">Diagnostics</code> library, you can define a conditional attribute such as the following class:</p><pre class="programlisting">using UnityEngine; &#13;
using System.Diagnostics; <span class="emphasis"><em>//Needed for the Conditional attribute</em></span> &#13;
 &#13;
public class myDebug : MonoBehaviour { &#13;
 &#13;
  [Conditional("DEBUG_MODE")] <span class="emphasis"><em>// Conditional attribute</em></span> &#13;
  public static void Log(string message) { &#13;
   <span class="emphasis"><em> //Print the message in the console</em></span> &#13;
    UnityEngine.Debug.Log(message); &#13;
  } &#13;
} &#13;
</pre><p>As a result, you can use the following line of code, instead of the preceding one:</p><pre class="programlisting">myDebug.Log("Hello World"); &#13;
</pre><p>This line will be compiled only if the <code class="literal">DEBUG_MODE</code> attribute is defined within your game. You can check which attributes are present in your game by navigating through <span class="strong"><strong>Edit | Project Settings | Player</strong></span>. In the following screenshot, you will find where to define such attributes/symbols highlighted, and as you can see, I've also added the <code class="literal">DEBUG_MODE</code> attribute (which you should remove before shipping your game):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00611.jpeg" alt="Cleaning the release version"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip115"/>Tip</h3><p>For a very nice implementation of this system, you can take a look at the code in this link: <a class="ulink" href="https://gist.github.com/kimsama/4123043">https://gist.github.com/kimsama/4123043</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="More about communication between scripts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec115"/>More about communication between scripts</h2></div></div></div><p>In the last chapter, we saw many ways in which scripts can communicate with each other. However, Unity offers many other ways. One of these is messages to trigger functions. In fact, you can send a message to a game object asking to trigger a certain function if that function exists in any of the scripts attached to that game object.</p><p>However, this is an expensive (from a computational point of view) method to communicate between scripts, and it should be used only when necessary.</p><p>Moreover, Unity offers more than one messaging system, each one of them with their advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>In any case, these systems can be used to create your custom message system, which is a great way to broadcast messages to many scripts when certain events happen, for instance, when you need to switch difficulty at runtime and many scripts should be aware of the change (refer the <span class="emphasis"><em>Switching difficulty at runtime</em></span> section, for more information<span class="emphasis"><em>)</em></span>. You can find many implementations online, such as <a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Advanced_CSharp_Messenger">http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Advanced_CSharp_Messenger</a>, but I strongly advise you to create your own, since you will definitely learn more in this way. For instance, you can follow this tutorial: <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/events-creating-simple-messaging-system">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/events-creating-simple-messaging-system</a>.</p></div><div class="section" title="Documenting the code"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec116"/>Documenting the code</h2></div></div></div><p>When you work in a team, you need to properly comment all of the code you write. There are tools to help you automatically generate documentation, but you need to take the efforts to comment everything!</p><p>It may be worthwhile to also use the summary tag, which I didn't use in creating the tower defense project in order to increase the readability of the code for this book: <a class="ulink" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2d6dt3kf.aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2d6dt3kf.aspx</a>.</p><p>In any case, when you write your code, you should always maintain a balance between performance and readability, which often are in contrast. If the documentation is rich and full enough, even the most complicated performance optimization that makes code unreadable can be understood. Keep in mind: maintaining a level of elegance in your code should be your guiding principle when you writing it.</p></div><div class="section" title="Protecting your game"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec117"/>Protecting your game</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you have your game, you may want to protect it from piracy and/or game hacks. About this, there is an extensive literature, as well as different opinions about it. In fact, one of the major critique to these systems is that they make hackers' lives more difficult, as well as legitimate players' ones; the game will be eventually cracked, and you will end up with upset players. On the other hand, the opposite school of thought says that the major amount of revenue that is generated from a game happens in the first month from the release date (we are talking about non-online games) and therefore a protection system that lasts on month has done its job.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note116"/>Note</h3><p>One of the most popular (among both players and hackers) anti-piracy system used for games is Denuvo (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.denuvo.com">www.denuvo.com</a>). Although Devuno has received many critiques, it has kept many games from by being immediately cracked and is still giving a hard time for cracking others. You can find a list of games protected with this system (whether they have been cracked yet or not) here on Wikipedia: <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denuvo">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denuvo</a>.</p><p>For the most curios of you, Denuvo is an anti-tamper and not a <span class="strong"><strong>Digital Rights Management</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>DRM</strong></span>) system (which binds a legitimate copy of the game to an user). An anti-tamper makes harder to reverse engineering a DRM system in order to by-pass it.</p></div><p>However, in case you decide to include some kind of protection for your game, but you don't have time to develop your own systems, you can buy inexpensive and useful security tools from the Asset Store, such as these ones: <span class="emphasis"><em>Anti-Cheat Toolkit</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/10395">www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/10395</a>) or <span class="emphasis"><em>PlayerPrefs Elite</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18920">www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18920</a>).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note117"/>Note</h3><p>For more advanced protection systems (such as the aforementioned Denuvo), of course the price increases, making it hard for Indie game developers to afford one of them.

This is very important and can determine the success or not of your game. In order to proper balance your game, you need to do a lot of playtesting (we will see more about this later).</p><p>Imagine that we are playing a co-op game and I have a magical wand, special powers, and an invincibility. You, on the other hand have a flashlight. This clearly isn't balanced unless the flashlight was a compact version of all the stuff I had, which unluckily for you it's not. Now, this isn't just an issue when it comes to two player or even multiplayer games but also single player games where the AI are highly powered and drain all of your resources just to defeat them, if you can at all. The same goes for having limited opportunities to get power ups while other players are clearly not having any issues.</p><p>Balancing games is important for many reasons because it provides an even playing field and gives everyone the opportunity to win, lose, and progress. With every iteration of your game, and every subsequent update (especially if you change something significant), make sure that your game is balanced. For single and co-op games, this will be something that you can iron out with playtesting. For large-scale MMOs, you are able to playtest but there are likely to be unbalanced things that will come to light the longer people play, explore the world, develop and upgrade their character, and progress through the world.</p><p>One of the many ways that you can approach the balance of games is via a cost analysis approach. In this approach, you can begin by adding, removing, and substituting different features in your game. For example, instead of adding a new character, make an existing one more powerful, or replace it with a more powerful version of itself. So, instead of a <span class="emphasis"><em>Special Wizard</em></span>, substitute it with an <span class="emphasis"><em>Epic Wizard</em></span>. Alternatively, you could remove the <span class="emphasis"><em>Special Wizard</em></span> altogether, or add another type, such as an <span class="emphasis"><em>Elemental Wizard</em></span>. In each case, their abilities will change (or be removed) and as a result it will affect the overall dynamics of play, including how other characters will be able to battle against it. Some real-life examples of this are in games such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Clash of Clans</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Clash Royale</em></span>, where adjustments are made on a regular basis in order to balance gameplay.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note120"/>Note</h3><p>For further reading, check out this link: <a class="ulink" href="https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/08/20/level-16-game-balance">https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/08/20/level-16-game-balance</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Extending the Unity editor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec120"/>Extending the Unity editor</h2></div></div></div><p>The Unity Editor can actually be extended.

Wouldn't it be even awesome if one of you two could control the pandas and the other one the cupcake towers? What if you could connect many players together across the world? All these scenarios are possible by transforming your game into a multiplayer game, which could be potentially played by many different players over a network.</p><p>Unity offers many built-in functions to for multiplayer games, but they are not as easy as you would expect. But if you have money, there are many third-party plugins to make managing multiplayer games easier. The asset store of Unity is full of them!</p><p>In either case, programming a multiplayer game is not easy, because there are many different parts (such as the server, the client, security protocols, and so on) should work perfectly together, and that is not simple at all. As such, multiplayer and networking is one of the most difficult topics to face in game development (although possible, otherwise you wouldn't see so many online games around).</p><p>The best way to start to understand the principle of multiplayer programming is to read a book about it and (if you're using the built-in functions of Unity) read the official documentation about it, which can be found here: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNet.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNet.html</a>.</p></div><div class="section" title="Practice makes perfect"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec122"/>Practice makes perfect</h2></div></div></div><p>Nobody is born with knowledge of game programming or of Unity.

This is all relates to the atmosphere. Creating the right mood requires a number of different things, it's not just about how it looks but what it sounds like; it also has a way of communicating something to the player. Unfortunately, we cannot yet tap into touch (although there is a lot of research going on haptic interfaces), taste, or smell (with the exception of the Nosulus, a prototype device created by Ubisoft; it can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://nosulusrift.ubisoft.com">http://nosulusrift.ubisoft.com</a>). Therefore, how they look and sound is imperative to the atmosphere!</p><div class="section" title="Visuals"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec123"/>Visuals</h2></div></div></div><p>Games don't necessarily have to look amazing to be immersive, but they need to provide a visual environment that makes sense. Visuals can range from skyboxes, aesthetic style of objects and environment.</p><div class="section" title="Color schemes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec84"/>Color schemes</h3></div></div></div><p>Color represents mood, and anyone who has ever taken an art class learns early on that colors help to express emotions to the viewer. Although there is not a unique interpretation of colors, you could stick with a convention throughout all of your game.</p><p>A great tool for developing color schemes (as we covered back in <a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Communicating with the Player – the User Interface" href="part0043.xhtml#aid-190861">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Communicating with the Player – the User Interface</em></span>) is with Adobe Color CC, which you can find at <a class="ulink" href="https://color.adobe.com">https://color.adobe.com</a>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00613.jpeg" alt="Color schemes"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note121"/>Note</h3><p>Did you know that the concept of colors relating to our emotions originated from a man named Robert Plutchik<span class="emphasis"><em>,</em></span> who created the first color wheel of emotions in 1980?</p></div><div class="section" title="Homework"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec4"/>Homework</h4></div></div></div><p>Look at some games. Do they have a particular color dominant over others? If so, what would happen if you change the color to something that is opposite? For example, if it's mostly blues, what would happen if you changed it to reds or yellows? Make a list of what objects are affected by the dominant color. And why or why not? If they are/aren't, how would it affect the atmosphere if you changed them?</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Lighting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec85"/>Lighting</h3></div></div></div><p>When you walk into a room full of light, you might feel fresh, energized, and positive. Imagine, on the other hand, walking into a dark room without any light to gauge what is inside, or how big it is; it may feel a bit daunting. This may be the same room, but two different lighting conditions provide two very different atmospheres. Pairing it with other sensory cues such as sounds can make it all the more terrifying or uplifting. Of course, these are your stereotypic environments; a well-lit room doesn't always mean that nothing nasty will jump out just like a dark room means that it's full of enemies. These are some things to consider, especially for 3D environments when it comes to understanding how to communicate a sense of danger or peace.</p><div class="section" title="Lights in Unity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec5"/>Lights in Unity</h4></div></div></div><p>Unity implements different kinds of lights, which can be placed within our scenes. We didn't cover them, because they are strongly related to 3D games, although you may use them also for UIs (and therefore also in 2D games).</p><p>As mentioned in the preceding section, you need to consider lights in your scene as an art expression so as to create an atmosphere. Surprisingly, good-looking scenes don't have realistic lights at all. As many things in game development, there is a trade off with performances, since usually lights are expensive, especially if computed in real time. In fact, one of the most used techniques is to "<span class="emphasis"><em>bake</em></span>" the lights, which means to pre-calculate them. Of course, this method has many limitations, and that's why there are intermediate solutions as well. A good level designer should be able to place the right kind and number of lights in the scene to enhance the look without overloading the CPU and GPU, leading to a drop of the frame rate.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00614.jpeg" alt="Lights in Unity"/><div class="caption"><p>Image by Divine Unity Shrine, Shadowood Productions, Example of use of lights in Unity</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>We won't go any further in the details, but you can read more about them at the following links:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/lighting-overview">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/lighting-overview</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightingOverview.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightingOverview.html</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/introduction-lighting-and-rendering">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/graphics/introduction-lighting-and-rendering</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Homework"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec6"/>Homework</h4></div></div></div><p>Think of a particular part of a game that you might like. It can be inside or outside, but it has to be a single location. Now, try and find similar locations within other games. For example, let's choose a laboratory facility; compare one found in a game such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Portal</em></span> to one from <span class="emphasis"><em>Half-Life</em></span>. Keep going until you found at least five other examples and then pay attention to the lighting in each scene. Are they similar or dissimilar? Do they convey the same meaning or something different? For games that you haven't played before, watch online play through to get a sense of the environment.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Environment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec86"/>Environment</h3></div></div></div><p>Is your game set miles below earth in a secluded dungeon, a faraway castle, enchanted forest, or perhaps inside a foreign utopian world with mountains and glorious landscapes? How you convey your environment can add to your atmosphere. For example, creating a desert may not necessarily be a large plane of sand. There is vegetation (even if very few), animals, and in some cases wreckage. However, a desert on Mars is going to be very different from a desert in Egypt, or one in Australia. The same goes for mountains, waterfalls, hills, frozen lands, forests, and beneath the Earth's surface</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00615.jpeg" alt="Environment"/><div class="caption"><p>Image by Open-World demo collection of Unreal Engine: An example of a detailed forest</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00616.jpeg" alt="Environment"/><div class="caption"><p>Image by Alto's Adventure (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.altosadventure.com">www.altosadventure.com</a>): A minimalist environment, but it provides a great feel of the atmosphere that surrounds the scene</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="section" title="Homework"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec7"/>Homework</h4></div></div></div><p>Similar to what we did with lighting, we can do with the environment. For example, look at many different types of forests. Are they dense or sparse? Do they have tracks to guide the player or not? Are they occupied by wildlife or are they empty? Pay attention to how they are structured and consider why they are like this. It will give you some ideas how to go about designing your own environments, what works or doesn't work, and it maybe even some inspiration to try alternative approaches to the same environment.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Special effects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec87"/>Special effects</h3></div></div></div><p>A spell isn't much of anything without some magical effects behind it, just like a magician would look a little crazy if nothing happened when he or she moved their hands or wand. Special effects add that something special to action. It also provides the player with a bit of feedback when they do something. For example, when they fire a deadly spell, you will expect at least something pretty grand will happen. Even subtle effects, such as when you heal yourself, can go a long way in creating a more immersive experience.</p><div class="section" title="Particle systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec8"/>Particle systems</h4></div></div></div><p>Unity offers a great built-in particle system that can be used to create atmospheres in the scene.

Another example could be in an RTS with characters leaving a small trail, which increases the visual looking of your game although it is not realistic.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note123"/>Note</h3><p>It's worthwhile to point out that these visual effects have been largely improved in Unity 5.5, so if you are working with previous versions, you might find them really different.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00620.jpeg" alt="Other visual effects"/><div class="caption"><p>Image by the official documentation of Unity: An example of the Trail Render component of Unity in action</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip124"/>Tip</h3><p>Some of these effects are really expensive from a computational point of view. By knowing how to program in a <span class="strong"><strong>Graphic Library</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GL</strong></span>), it's possible to re-implement simpler versions (so without all of the features they have) of these effects within Unity in such a way they are highly optimized to reduce the performance overhead.</p></div><p>Other effects include Halos, Lens flares, and Projectors. Halos can be used to highlight objects in your scene, or just to simulate some really fine dust. Lens flares can simulate the effect of the sun on a camera. Projectors can be used to create relatively low-cost shadows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00621.jpeg" alt="Other visual effects"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Image by Battlefield 3 (DICE, 2011): An example of flare lenses used in video games</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Audio"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec124"/>Audio</h2></div></div></div><p>Audio can move us, bring us to tears, motivate, excite, and sometimes terrify us. In some cases, it can help to place us <span class="emphasis"><em>in </em></span>an environment. The power of music is something that can really add a nice special touch if done right. At the same time as it being incredibly amazing, it can be incredibly annoying. The pace, intensity, and even instrument can all create a different mood.</p><div class="section" title="Music"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec88"/>Music</h3></div></div></div><p>Music can serve a specific purpose such as being used as background music. It can provide a level of ambience and drama to an experience that visuals alone cannot provide. Depending on the part of the game, the music is likely to change. We can think of such an example in real life, the music we would use to meditate is likely to be quite different from the music when we are lifting weights in a gym.</p><p>In saying that, background music tends to remain consistent and continues to play throughout an entire level. Whereas, gameplay tends to be dynamic and music can also reflect this. For example, a beautifully created piece of background music with strings playing softly; as soon as a dragon appears, the mood is likely to change and so is the music. Some more examples may include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Opening/closing credits, sequences, and cut-scenes.</li><li class="listitem">A character encountering combat.</li><li class="listitem">Being chased.</li><li class="listitem">When a character enters a dangerous area.

The use of sound can range from setting the atmosphere, indicating feedback, acknowledging an action, providing sound effects to various items (such as weapons), to indicating an event has occurred.</p><p>Using sounds are not just limited to background music. When we do things, anything, we make a noise, and gameplay is no exception. When a character knocks something over, it should make a noise, when they walk, open a door, draw a weapon, they should all make some sort of sound. Some sound effects that you may use in your game include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Spells being cast</li><li class="listitem">Ricochet</li><li class="listitem">Bullets whizzing by</li><li class="listitem">Splashing in water</li><li class="listitem">Cable/robes breaking when cut</li><li class="listitem">Doors creaking</li><li class="listitem">Glass shattering</li><li class="listitem">Footsteps</li><li class="listitem">Flying down a zip line</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Eliciting emotions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec90"/>Eliciting emotions</h3></div></div></div><p>In some instances, you'd want to elicit a certain emotion from a player such as when a character dies or when the player is triumphant. Just like movies, when we want to increase the emotion with a particular aspect of the game, albeit during a cut-scene or gameplay, music can do this. Think of some moments during gameplay when you have been moved in both a negative and positive way. Here is a list of some moments when you may want to elicit the player's emotion:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Introduction of a new character(s)</li><li class="listitem">Death/Birth of a character</li><li class="listitem">Sadness/Happiness</li><li class="listitem">Anger/Happiness</li><li class="listitem">Victory/Defeat</li><li class="listitem">Dramatic</li><li class="listitem">Creepy</li><li class="listitem">Romantic/Envy</li><li class="listitem">Tension</li></ul></div><p>These are just some of the many emotions that your game can evoke.</p></div><div class="section" title="Homework"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec91"/>Homework</h3></div></div></div><p>A great exercise to do before you start to decide what sounds to add into your own game is to play a range of different games and make note of what sounds they use. Do this for background music and sound effects. You might be surprised about the amount of different sounds that each game has. Also take note of how the music in levels transition, do the sounds effects also change?</p><p>Keep in mind that you don't just have to play games; watching movies and even TV series can also be useful to see the types of noises that are made, when, and if they add any kind of element (scare, represents happiness) within the scene/movie.</p></div><div class="section" title="Audio in Unity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec92"/>Audio in Unity</h3></div></div></div><p>Audio is another extensive topic in Unity, which from Unity 5.x has greatly improved. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to have dedicated a whole chapter on how to handle audio in Unity. However, the foundational concept is that there is a component that works as listeners. There should be only one (active) listener per each scene, otherwise Unity gives you a warning about, and it is good practice to keep in that way. Then, there is another component that works as an audio source, which can produce a sound or play some music. Moreover, audio sources can be set to act in 3D, which means that they can be placed in the environment so as to have a spatial sound (the closer the player from the audio source, the higher the volume of the audio source will be).</p><p>In the official website, there is a series of video tutorials on how to use audio in Unity, which can be found here: <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/audio">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/audio</a></p></div><div class="section" title="External audio systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec93"/>External audio systems</h3></div></div></div><p>In case you are aiming high and the built-in audio system of Unity is not enough for your game, there are pieces of third-party software you can integrate into Unity.</p><p>One of the most used is called FMOD (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fmod.org">www.fmod.org</a>), which is a complete solution to integrate spatial sounds in your game.</p><p>Another similar tool, which is less used due to its high price but offers many features, is Wwise (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.audiokinetic.com/products/wwise">https://www.audiokinetic.com/products/wwise</a>). You probably have seen its logo in some games you play.</p><p>Both FMOD and Wwise are really powerful tools, but in order to appreciate their features, you should see them in action. There are many videos available online, and I encourage you to check them out.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Teamwork"><div class="titlepage" id="aid-3279U2"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec94"/>Teamwork</h1></div></div></div><p>They say it takes a village to raise a child, well, it can take a team to build a game, and a team that works well together can achieve incredible things. However, choosing the right people, dealing with conflict and working on a daily basis together isn't always straightforward. Next, we will look at a few ideas about the roles in a game development team, considerations that need to be made, and a few other things that will get you all on your way.</p><div class="section" title="It is not just about you, it is about working in a team"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec125"/>It is not just about you, it is about working in a team</h2></div></div></div><p>A good team is like any good relationship; you need to have communication, consideration, and understanding, and most importantly you must acknowledge the other person. There is no <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> in a team, but too often people get caught up in the <span class="emphasis"><em>me</em></span>. In such cases, neglecting others within the team can be for many reasons, from ego, skillset (or lack of), impatience, financial gain and so on. Of course, this is not to say that such traits are negative, but in the wrong amount (just like anything), they are a sure way to end up in a disaster.</p><p>Another issue when it comes to teams is the amount of time that you have known the others. This is not bad thing, nor can it always be a good one. The idea, especially if you're going into business with each other is to keep it professional. You have a product that you need to deliver, deadlines that need to be met, and potentially stakeholders who are involved in your project. You must be able to separate business and friendship. The dynamics will change, and you need to avoid making it personal.</p><p>A game development team will consist of different roles, and how big your team is determines how those roles are carried out. In a perfect world, you will have a team member for each role, but in most cases you will have to double up on responsibilities. In saying this, a typical team is likely to consist of the following members:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>The project manager</strong></span>: Who sets milestones for the team and makes sure that they are achieved. But it is not just time management; the project manager should also encourage and motivate the team and members who fall behind deadlines. They help to boost team morale and keep the project running smoothly and, more importantly, on time.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>The producer</strong></span>: Who will be the person who deals with the business side of the things. They are responsible for maintaining budgets, schedules, and marketing strategies. They differ from the project manager in the sense that they are more about logistics and the technical details than managing the group's functioning.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>The social media strategist</strong></span>: Who is someone who is dedicated to all social media and marketing aspects of your game. Typically, the producer is also responsible for this, but in some cases, depending on the extent of social media that you will want, having someone dedicated to promoting you game can help free up time for budgets and the financial aspect of your group's producer.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>The designer</strong></span>: Who will be the one who ties all the elements together to create the overall experience. They ensure that what is created complements the story; they decide how it is revealed to the player and ultimately how the player interacts with its flow.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>The artist</strong></span>: Who is responsible for creating the look of the game, from concept art of characters, assets, and levels all the way to their models and textures. It is ideal to have more than one artist if you are able to, especially if your game is large. Art takes time, especially if you want your game to be aesthetically magical.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>The programmer</strong></span>: Who is like the arm to the hand of the project; without them, you are likely to struggle to make your wonderful ideas come to life. In saying all of this, if you are unlucky to not have a Programmer in your team (or not enough for all the functionalities that you may want to develop), many game engines offer visual scripting that allows you to link commands together to create actions. A great example of this is Blueprints in Unreal Engine (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.unrealengine.com">www.unrealengine.com</a>), as shown here:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00622.jpeg" alt="It is not just about you, it is about working in a team"/><div class="caption"><p>Image by Unreal Engine, Blueprints visual scripting (<a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints">https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints</a>)</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>The sound designer/composer</strong></span>: Who makes your game sound great. The sound designer ensures that every action has some sort of audio feedback. Audio in a game includes sound effects and background music. Sound designers contribute to the atmosphere by making it sound alive. Even the subtlest effects, such as when a player nears some dark and dangerous room, can arouse all kinds of emotions.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>The quality assurance (QA) tester</strong></span>: Who is the person (or people) dedicated to making sure that the game works. This can range from friends, family and professional gamers and QA testers. Ideally, you will want people who are not involved in the creation of your project to be QA testers, because even though you will be testing it yourself, it is easy to look past aspects of your game that may impact the overall gameplay experience.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>The writer</strong></span>: Who<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>is usually responsible developing the story of the game. Elements of the story can include the overall plot, the characters, setting, and other narrative elements such as dialogue and narrative pathways such as alternate endings. In essence, the writer is responsible for ensuring that the story not only entices and captivates leaving them wanting for more but also to set the atmosphere and enhance the overall game experiences. In addition, the writer must also ensure that the story makes sense, follows a logical progression and is explanative. Lastly, one thing to keep in mind is that writing for games requires a different approach than movies or reading text because it is interactive.</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Sharing a common vision"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec94"/>Sharing a common vision</h3></div></div></div><p>When you're working in a team, it is important to have a common goal and shared interest. While it goes without saying, morale is key when it comes to working on team projects. There will be difficult moments in the project, late nights, and points where stress levels will rise, but having the support of others can improve the way that everyone is able to cope through it all. There will be moments when you are busy, not able to, or just overloaded with work that inhibits your ability to get it done. Of course, if you've been lazy, that is an entirely different situation, but you should always communicate any difficulty with the other team members, and as soon as possible. To really illustrate this point, consider the poetic notion of the Butterfly Effect: <span class="emphasis"><em>Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?</em></span> Small (unresolved) problems in the beginning become bigger problems later.</p></div><div class="section" title="Managing expectations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec95"/>Managing expectations</h3></div></div></div><p>Having a common vision is not always the same as having the same expectations. For example, you and your team might want to make a high selling and popular application, but the amount of time and effort that will be given from each team member can vary. Therefore, it is important to establish expectations too, early on, for a number of reasons.</p><p>In addition to expectations, be sure to take the time to plan the development of your game properly. You don't want to over-plan what you intend to do, if you have little time or your game contains necessary components. Along the same lines, the same can be said for under-planning, where you decide on the design of the game but not allow yourself enough time to complete it in. You will get to a point where your team will begin to cut back on sections, in order to meet the goals. In the end, you might end up with something equivalent to a demo version of your game without the exciting full version to keep players interested in your work, or worse, you won't have a completed game at all.</p><p>Lastly, never assume anything. Assumptions are likely to result in disasters later on. For example, you look at the wonderfully planned Gantt chart of things to do, and at this stage your artists should be modeling assets, but in reality they aren't; or at least one of them isn't because they thought that the other artist was. Having a regular meetings and a good project manager and producer will likely avoid this situation from occurring, but always keep up to date with what others are up to.</p></div><div class="section" title="Collaboration and communication are key"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec96"/>Collaboration and communication are key</h3></div></div></div><p>The worst thing that can happen within a group is to stop talking. Maybe things have hit a lull and people become busy, maybe something happened in a member's personal life, in any case, things happen that may draw our attention elsewhere; it's life after all. However, this is no reason for teams to stop talking. If communication breaks down, find out why and do something about it early on. Perhaps the issue is something small and can be dealt with easily. In other cases, it can be damaging to a project's success, such as work not being completed because a team member is too embarrassed to admit that they are unable to complete a task or is simply too busy, but fails to notify anyone until the last minute. One way to avoid such problems is to make it easy to communicate within the group and to communicate often<span class="emphasis"><em>.</em></span></p></div><div class="section" title="Ways to communicate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec97"/>Ways to communicate</h3></div></div></div><p>While it is obvious, there are a few relatively simple ways to keep in touch by using the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>E-mail: </strong></span>The electronic snail mail is great for keeping a thread for conversations, but it can become quite difficult to manage. In these situations, it would ideal to schedule a regular (for example, weekly or monthly) progress update. Give it a deadline and a template. For example, a list of things that they need to cover such as currently working on, problems, and future work. In this way, you're able to keep up-to-date with how everyone is going, and so is everyone else. To make the whole process a bit easier to manage, there are functions such as tagging and filtering in most (if not all) e-mail software. In these instances, e-mails relating to specified criteria, such as e-mail address or subject are then directed to a specific folder and/or given a tag to make it easier to retrieve later on.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>WhatsApp</strong></span>: You are likely to have the phone numbers of your other team members, albeit personal or business numbers. Therefore, phone messaging services like WhatsApp are great ways to keep in touch and make calls regardless of where they are in the world.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Social media groups and chats such as Facebook</strong></span>. With Facebook, you can keep communication lines open in a number of ways. You can create a message group or a private group. The difference between the two is minimal, in that they function in much the same way, you can upload documents and discuss. However, a group functions much the same way as a Facebook page. So if you upload an image, it creates a separate post, as opposed to within a chat, where it would just be added as the next part of dialogue in the conversation.
The advantages of creating a Facebook group is that it is easier to manage in terms of finding certain items, and keeping conversations more specific to a post (or topic).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Skype/Google Hangouts, and so on: </strong></span>Save time in typing something, and give someone a call. Never underestimate the power of a voice/video call. While sometimes, especially if you're working over distance, it is important to maintain contact that is beyond text communication. It adds a more personal level to your work relationship, and you get a better sense of the other person, than trying to read between the lines.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Version control"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec126"/>Version control</h2></div></div></div><p>An effective solution for artists to share files, such as textures and meshes, between them, is by using a cloud storage service (such as Google Drive or Dropbox, which we will discuss later). However, when it comes to programmers and developers, sharing files is a different situation. During the development of a game, programmers tend to work collaboratively with their code and script files. As a result, there are some important needs that should be taken into consideration:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Programmers work together on the same source code. This may involve (but is not limited to) collaborating on different areas within a project, as well as the same file(s). As a result, without having some sort of file control, it can become quite messy with no way to keep track of what has been modified.</li><li class="listitem">The general nature of programming in a project will involve utilizing a range of different techniques and trying varying solutions to a range of problems that will be the best for the project. Therefore, if large changes are made or changes that are not necessarily the right solution, programmers need to have a way to go back to a previous version.</li><li class="listitem">Reusing all or part of code from other sources, like libraries and source-files, where it's relevant can help to save a lot of time later on. By doing this, it is possible to save time for parts of the project that have similar elements to existing projects leaving more time for more complicated parts.</li></ol><div style="height:10px; width: 1px"/></div><p>By having some kind of version control in place, coders are able to utilize a file-system that not only identifies and tracks file changes, but allows programmers to reverse them. In addition, version control can also help to facilitate programmers to reuse and integrate code form external sources and/or projects. These features, and more, are supported by a piece of version control software.</p><p>Git is a free and open source program for version control. You can download it by visiting the Git home page here: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.git-scm.com">www.git-scm.com</a>. Once installed and properly configured, it can be used to apply version control to your files, thus being an incredible asset to your workflow.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip125"/>Tip</h3><p>There are some visual tools to manage Git in an easier way. One of the most complete is SourceTree (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com">www.sourcetreeapp.com</a>) by Atlassian. However, if you are a newcomer, probably you'll find it easier to use GitKraken (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gitkraken.com">www.gitkraken.com</a>) by Axosoft.</p><p>Moreover, if you want to learn Git, here there is a quick and nice interactive tutorial: <a class="ulink" href="https://try.github.io">https://try.github.io</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Make a GDD and stick to it"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec127"/>Make a GDD and stick to it</h2></div></div></div><p>When starting out, everyone will have an idea, concept, or something to add to the overall development of the game. At this stage, this is fantastic because it will give you lots to mull over when it comes to refining your game and provide you with an array of different choices to make.</p><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>game design document</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GDD</strong></span>)<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>is a neat way to have a current version of what your game is and will be. Think of the GDD as a manual that defines your aesthetic, audio, naming conventions, story, characters, and other bits and pieces of your game. It is a point of a reference, a game bible if you will. The structure of a GDD varies, and there is no right or wrong way to do it, as it will all depend on what your game is. However, there are some sections that define the substance of your game. For example:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Introduction</strong></span>:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">What is your game about? Think of this like an elevator pitch. Keep it short, sharp, and to the point. You don't want to go into too many specifics but enough to give the overall gist of your game. For example,<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>Sugar mountain, Panda invasion is a 2D real-time tower defense game where the player must defeat Pandas with various edible projectiles.</li><li class="listitem">Who is your game aimed towards? Children, adults, perhaps both? Ideally, this is where you consider the demographics that you want to engage your game with.</li><li class="listitem">Where will your game be featured / what devices? Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, all come with different challenges and require different considerations, so keep this in mind and defined early on to minimize headaches later on down the track.</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Art</strong></span>:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Mood boards that define the aesthetic style that you're wanting to achieve. These can be general or specific for a character or level. That help to guide the art direction when it comes to creating concept art.</li><li class="listitem">Concept art includes anything that defines the current state of the game. Of course, previous art can be kept in the GDD, but it is ideal to move it to an appendix, or separate section to maintain the relevancy of the document.</li><li class="listitem">UI/GUI/HUD all relates to how the interactive elements will look, and basically how anything else that isn't in the game will appear. For example, if you have a HUD (heads-up display), how will it appear in-game. How much for the screen will it take up, and how will it work with the current aesthetic style?</li><li class="listitem">Characters will need to be illustrated in order to provide an idea about their appearance, which will then be modeled (or drawn in the case of 2D) and animated. Drawing characters in various poses, environments and situations will help to illustrate more about the character's personality and overall appearance.</li><li class="listitem">Assets that will populate your game environment that will then be created (drawn or modeled) later on.</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Audio</strong></span>:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The background music that will set the atmosphere for the game. It can be as simple as music that provides an ambient soundtrack to exploring environments or act as audio cues when the player is approaching some significant part of the level.</li><li class="listitem">Sound effects that not only provide a source of feedback for actions such as when an object makes contact with a surface but also when an event occurs such as the player winning or losing.</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Story</strong></span>:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Character biographies will include information that relates to each character from their general information (age and appearance), background story, personality and their relationships with other characters within the game. Depending on your type of game it will be general or extremely detailed (as with role-playing games).</li><li class="listitem">The general plot of your game will provide everyone with what the game is about. Like character biographies, the level of detail will depend on the type of game. For instance, you might not even have a story if it's a game like <span class="emphasis"><em>Sudoku</em></span> (unless of course your solutions unlock doors to free a princess).</li><li class="listitem">Narrative flow will explain how the narrative is revealed as the game progresses. Think of it like a map that indicates when and how parts of the narrative is revealed to the player and how each part of the game relates to the narrative. For example, having a player cross through an underground cave is not going to save the princess who is stuck in the castle on the other side of the map, unless of course the cave has a secret passage to get you there. Just like gameplay, your narrative needs to relate to what you are doing in the game, and vice versa.</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Technical</strong></span>:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Pipeline overview will briefly explain the software that is going to be used to build the game (game engines, third-party plugins, and so on) and how to connect them together. Moreover, it establishes a connection between the art and the software, and how these can communicate (such as, how the graphics should be packed to be used in the software/game).</li><li class="listitem">Technical design will explain how the different parts of your game are connected and establish conventions. Moreover, it contains how interfaces should be implemented so in order to maintain consistency within the project, and how to encapsulate the work in tasks (which can be done by different people) and how to integrate them together. Often the technical design is in a technical design document, separate from the game design, since it only used by programmers.</li><li class="listitem">System limitations will explain which are the limitations of the technology used, to other members of the team who are not programmers (in fact, more detailed limitations are in the technical design document).

From one level/cut-scene/and so on, to the next. Similar to the narrative flow, game flow discusses what the player will be doing within the game as they progress through the narrative. For example, they will go to part A of the map, kill 20 dragons and then discover the magical elixir, cue cut-scene revealing the truth about his father, then the player is transported to a magical island to explore the family archives. By doing this, you begin to see the holes in your gameplay and/or story and are able to make sure that it not only makes sense but it progresses at pace that the player will enjoy; that is the game is neither too fast nor boring and confusing.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Timeline</strong></span>: It refers to the time that it takes your game from start to finish and all the progress milestones and deadlines to ensure that your game will reach the release date:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Milestones are like the stepping stones to progress your project further. These are generally when the game reaches a significant point, such as art assets completed, cool function implemented, first working prototype, and so on. Milestones can be as frequent or infrequent as you want, but they are one way to keep on top of what everyone is up to, to ensure that work is delivered within a timeframe to reach a ranger of different project targets.</li><li class="listitem">Deadlines can be as daunting as they sound, because if it's an important one, it can ruin a project and end up costing (albeit money and time).</li><li class="listitem">Important dates are well important. They are the days where everyone will either need to be present, on site (if you have a physical location), online (if you have a virtual location), or present in any other shape or form. These dates can be for a range of different reasons from stakeholder, client, and even potential employer meetings. Members of a team should take these meetings seriously, arrive on time, and be prepared. Meeting notes should also be taken, in order to keep a log of what happens.</li></ul></div></li></ol><div style="height:10px; width: 1px"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Keeping it tidy with project management tools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec128"/>Keeping it tidy with project management tools</h2></div></div></div><p>No one likes a cluttered workspace; even an organized chaos has its limits when you need that one document. The same goes for when you are developing games that are likely to have a lot of files. Therefore, we must find ways to not only manage the files, but also the team members so that we all know where the files are but a way to communicate with others about them. There are many programs out there for team and file management, some of the most popular and useful ones are discussed next.</p><div class="section" title="Slack"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec98"/>Slack</h3></div></div></div><p>Slack (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.slack.com">www.slack.com</a>) is one of the most effective team management tools. It keeps all your conversations, topics, to-do lists, notes, and many other bits and pieces from your project all in the one place.</p><p>Some of these features are explained here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Channels keep topics separated and the discussion focused. Think of them like rooms that have a specific topic of discussion. For example, you may have an art channel that focuses directly on the art of your project. It also provides a place for other team members to request or check on the progress of certain items. Channels can be as broad or as narrow as you want them to be.</li><li class="listitem">The app makes Slack a much easier app to manage on the go. It allows you to receive real-time updates when members of your group upload and/or post anything. In addition, it allows you to also interact with Slack whenever and wherever. For example, you get a great idea or you might see something that is useful to a concept that you're developing, with the Slack application, all you have to do is post or snap your idea and submit it to the channel. You can think of channels like groups.</li><li class="listitem">Slack's App Directory allow you to integrate other applications (some of which we will explore later) into Slack to make it the ultimate project management software.

However, it is more directed towards game development. For example, you are able to provide timelines to work towards, assign points or value to each task, which can then be used to determine the payment of a particular part of the game and/or contribution from the creator. It allows you to have, at a glance, a relatively detailed overview of project in its most current state. If you have a look at the following screenshot, you can see that there are a number of different boards, each indicating a different part of the production pipeline, from things that have yet to commence in <span class="strong"><strong>Planned</strong></span> to things that have been finishing in <span class="strong"><strong>Completed</strong></span>.

Not only does it offer programs that are like those from other well-known commercial products, but also it has sharing capabilities that make the whole process much easier. You can easily create and share documents, files and folders with as many or as few people as you want either via a private link or through permission. There are many ways you can control access to files (from editing to read-only); it will all come down to the purpose of sharing them in the first place.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00625.jpeg" alt="Drive"/><div class="caption"><p>Image by Google Drive</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip126"/>Tip</h3><p>Some alternatives to Drive in terms of files and document creation are Apache OpenOffice (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.openoffice.org">www.openoffice.org</a>) and ONLYOFFICE (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.onlyoffice.com">www.onlyoffice.com</a>).</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Dropbox"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec101"/>Dropbox</h3></div></div></div><p>Like Google Drive, except with the addition of other software, Dropbox (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.dropbox.com">www.dropbox.com</a>) provides a versatile tool for managing project files.

It allows you to create a board, where all your tasks are kept. Each board features different panels that feature tasks. Of course, these are ordered as you prefer, depending on what kind of process you are intending to use Trello for. For example, developing a pipeline style Trello board may feature different areas such as art, design, programming, and audio; all of these are then assigned tasks specific to their area. For example, the art section may feature tasks such as concepts for main menu or concept art of the princess tower, and so on. Each task can then also be assigned to specific people, or be left open for anyone in the group to engage with. Once a task is completed, it could be moved to another section, which of course, is appropriately named finished or simply left and moved to the bottom of the list.

To make our gem shine, we need to polish it up with a few things to make it work better, as well as ensure that it will work as we want it to. By now, you should have already tested it (more than once), so you will have a few ideas about what needs to be improved, such as lag. In the following sections, we will explore ways to optimize various parts of the game so that by the time you publish it, you will have something that runs smoothly and effectively.</p><div class="section" title="Processing the power"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec129"/>Processing the power</h2></div></div></div><p>One thing that you will want to make sure to do before you really get stuck into the development of your game is to determine whether or not it is optimized for the device(s) that you are targeting it towards. Often optimization is seen as the last step in game development, but it is not true. The sooner you consider optimization in your development workflow, the less the effort required later on to optimize your game.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note127"/>Note</h3><p>Unity provides great resources for optimizing for mobile platforms such as specific optimizations such as script and graphics. You can find them here: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MobileOptimizationPracticalGuide.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MobileOptimizationPracticalGuide.html</a>.</p></div><p>Different devices come with their own issues that you need to overcome. Just like our own brains, mobile devices (and computers in general) can process so much at any one time. As a result, this will ultimately impact the overall performance of your game. For example, certain parts such as graphics (both 2D and 3D), or just inefficient code can be extremely draining. Ultimately, this will impact the running of your game, causing it to lag. In addition to the device, depending on what dimension that you designed in (2D or 3D) will require different considerations, of which we are going to explore in the following sections.</p><div class="section" title="Checking the build size"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec109"/>Checking the build size</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the many things you you need to take into account, is the dimension of your game, especially since it will impact how it will be distributed and/or released. Thus, checking how the size of your build is key in understanding the dimensions of your game. You can just build the game (how to do it, it's explained later in the chapter), and check its size. However, this doesn't give us much information on what we could reduce.</p><p>After you have built the game, you can right-click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> window and then select <span class="strong"><strong>Open Editor Log</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00634.jpeg" alt="Checking the build size"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Your operating system will open the <code class="literal">Editor.txt</code> file with your default text editor; near the end, you can find some statistics about your last build, and in particular the size divided by the different elements of your game. You should have something similar to this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00635.jpeg" alt="Checking the build size"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>There are details related to individual files (only a fragment is shown) as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00636.jpeg" alt="Checking the build size"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>As you can see, most of our game size is taken by <span class="strong"><strong>Textures</strong></span>, which is common in 2D games. Let's explore how we can reduce the size of the textures in the following section.</p></div><div class="section" title="Texture optimitation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec110"/>Texture optimitation</h3></div></div></div><p>Some image formats can be problematic, such as file size. Thankfully, in Unity you can reduce the file size in a number of ways:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Change the image resolution.</li><li class="listitem">Change how Unity will handle that specific image.</li></ol><div style="height:10px; width: 1px"/></div><p>In Unity, you can change these in the importing settings.

But as you can see from the preceding screenshot, there are many other options to set the texture in perfect conditions for your game.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip128"/>Tip</h3><p>As you can see from the previous screenshot, there is a warning about POT textures. What are those? <span class="strong"><strong>Power Of Two</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>POT</strong></span>) textures are squared images in which the length of the side is a power of 2 (such as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4092, and so on). Since the hardware we have, runs with a binary system, the power of 2 is really important, because some techniques allow it to be processed in a certain way. As a result, performance can improve. In the specific case of the warning, to be compressed into DXT5 format. Therefore, although it's hard to have all the textures of your game as POT textures, you should consider having as many as you can.</p><p>As you can read from the previous screenshot, our Panda sprite sheet is an <span class="strong"><strong>NPOT</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Non-Power-Of-Two</strong></span>) texture, because this sprite sheet was designed for clarity to learn animations back in <a class="link" title="Chapter 4. No Longer Alone – Sweet-Toothed Pandas Strike" href="part0056.xhtml#aid-1LCVG1">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>No Longer Alone – Sweet-Toothed Pandas Strike</em></span>, and not to be optimized.</p></div><p>To improve the performance of your game, the most important parameters are: <span class="strong"><strong>Generate </strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mip Maps</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Filter Mode</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Max Size</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Compression</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Format</strong></span>. To make it easier to understand, they have been highlighted in the previous screenshot:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Generate Mip Maps</strong></span>: It is an option that, if checked, creates smaller versions of the texture/sprite. Therefore, when the sprite is far or small with respect to the camera, the smaller version is rendered. As a result, there is a gain performance at runtime, but it could increase the size of your build.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Filter Mode</strong></span>: It allows you to apply a filter to the image, in particular to make the borders a little blurry. It might be useful, when working with pixel art, to have some filters can be handy. This is because filter makes your asset less pixelated. <span class="strong"><strong>Filter Mode</strong></span> selects how the texture is filtered when it gets stretched by transformations:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Point</strong></span>: The texture becomes blocky up close</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Bilinear</strong></span>: The texture becomes blurry up close</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Trilinear</strong></span>: This is like <span class="strong"><strong>Bilinear</strong></span>, but the texture also blurs between the different mip levels</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Max Size</strong></span>: As the name suggests, places a limit on the maximum size that the image can have within that specific platform. In fact, while it may be ideal to have hi-res pictures or graphics to enhance the experience, it is not not the best for an application in terms of performance. This option allows you to drastically reduce your build size, in case you have problems with it, at the cost of quality.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Compression</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> Format</strong></span>: Specify whether or not the image will be compressed when the game will be compiled/built. It is important to remember, that if your target device is a particular platform, or really old, it is possible that it might not be able to support some compression formats. Again, there is a trade-off between quality and performance.</li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip129"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>Exercise</strong></span>:</p><p>Since we don't have the time to go through all the single options in detail, as an exercise, find out how all the other settings work in the official documentation.

One of the main issues (at least in 3D games) is polycounts, which are the number of faces that your 3D assets have. For instance, if you think of a cube, each face is a polygon, and therefore a cube would have a total of six polygons (some graphic cards don't support quads, and so the six faces of the cube should be split into two triangles each, resulting in a total of 12 polygons). In saying this, it is the cumulative total that needs to be kept into consideration. Get it too low and you are going to have a game that looks relatively blocky; too much and it's likely (especially for mobile devices) to lag. To check the polycount inside your Unity scene, head to the top-right hand corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> view, and check the <span class="strong"><strong>Stats</strong></span> option, as highlighted in this image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00638.jpeg" alt="Stats and profiling"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>To get a better idea of how you should model, in the User Manual for Unity, there is a page that explains how to model assets and characters in order for them to be optimized. You can read it here: <a class="ulink" href="http://polycount.com/discussion/130371/polygon-count-for-smartphone-applications">http://polycount.com/discussion/130371/polygon-count-for-smartphone-applications</a>.</p><p>Once you have done this, a popup as shown in the next screenshot should appear. The statistics in this popup shows you information related to the performance of different things, such as draw calls. In addition, it also indicates how many polygons are present in your current view of the scene. In fact, one of the great advantages of this S<span class="strong"><strong>tats</strong></span> screen is that you can use it in real time when you press play so that you can observe which parts of your games are more resource heavy than others (we mentioned this back in <a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Baking Cupcake Towers" href="part0028.xhtml#aid-QMFO1">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Baking Cupcake Towers</em></span>):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00639.jpeg" alt="Stats and profiling"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>The most important parameters to check (highlighted in the screenshot) are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>FPS</strong></span> (Frames-Per-Seconds): As the name suggests, this shows how many frames your game can produce per second. Of course, this value could change drastically between different devices and/or computers depending on their hardware. You should ensure that your game is able to run at least at 50/60 FPS on each one of your target platforms.<div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note130"/>Note</h3><p>In some cases, you'd want to limit the maximum amount of FPS, for two reasons:</p><p>Some monitors have a limited refresh rate</p><p>The human eye has a limited refresh rate too</p><p>Therefore, you may want to avoid producing more frames than you actually need, resulting in a waste of computational resources.</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Tris</strong></span> (Triangles) and <span class="strong"><strong>Verts</strong></span> (Vertices): They indicate how many triangles and vertices are rendered in the current frame from the active cameras (more than one camera might be active). Especially in 3D games, this is crucial. The more the <span class="strong"><strong>Tris</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Verts</strong></span>, the more details you can include, but it's at the cost of performance.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>SetPass calls</strong></span>: This indicates how many iterations Unity needs to go through to render that specific frame. You should do everything you can to try to reduce this number. The smaller the number of iterations, the faster Unity will render that specific frame, and hence increasing your FPS.</li></ul></div><p>If you need more sophisticated statistics about the use of resources in your game, you can access the <span class="strong"><strong>Profiler</strong></span> by navigating through <span class="strong"><strong>Window | Profiler </strong></span>from the top menu bar. You should have a screen like the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00640.jpeg" alt="Stats and profiling"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>The window has been stretched vertically in order to show you as many categories as possible. However, since the empty spaces will be filled up with graphs and the different parts of your game, the profiling window should be enlarged as much as possible. If you have a dual monitor setup, consider placing the profiling window in your second monitor.</p><p>This powerful tool allows you to monitor in detail how the different components of your game use resources. The Profiler helps you to optimize your game by analyzing the performance of the GPU, CPU, memory, rendering, and audio. Therefore, you can have an idea of how much computational power is spent in the different areas of your game. For example, you might want to know the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or even in your game logic.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note131"/>Note</h3><p>You can find more about the Profiler in the official documentation (<a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Profiler.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Profiler.html</a>) or in a video tutorial from the official website at <a class="ulink" href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/interface-essentials/introduction-profiler">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/interface-essentials/introduction-profiler</a>.</p><p>In addition, you can do remote profiling as well; on <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProfilerWindow.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProfilerWindow.html</a>, towards the end, you will find a section named <span class="emphasis"><em>Remote profiling</em></span>.

For example, sometimes you can apply many different materials (and maps) to an object to give it a range of cool effects; however, less is more. For games that are played on computer or console, this is not a big issue, but one that needs to be considered. For games on mobile devices, it is important to keep in mind that they are capable of handling some cool effects, but everything has a limit. Keeping this in mind in the early stages of your game's development will help to reduce the stress and amount of work in the later stages if you need to adjust some components of your game. Some materials could be really expensive from a computational point of view. There are shaders which replicate (with a good approximation) cool effects but are optimized for mobile (such as the bloom effect we discussed earlier).</p><p>The ideas explored in this small paragraph is just scratching the surface in optimizing your application from a graphical point of you. However, you can continue your reading here: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OptimizingGraphicsPerformance.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OptimizingGraphicsPerformance.html</a>.</p><p>Another way in which you can optimize your game is to pay attention to your code.</p><p>In previous versions of Unity (before version 5), there was the need to cache the Transform component. As you can read at the end of this article at <a class="ulink" href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/06/23/unity5-api-changes-automatic-script-updating">

</a>, there is no more need for this. However, there are still developers that use it; now it should be avoided since it reduces the code readability a lot, and therefore the development process as well. In any case, you should still cache other components into variables, as we did for the UI back in <a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Communicating with the Player – the User Interface" href="part0043.xhtml#aid-190861">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Communicating with the Player – the User Interface</em></span>.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note132"/>Note</h3><p>In case you are using an old version of Unity, or you just want to understand what was the caching of the Transform component, look at this line of code:</p><p><code class="literal">transform.position = Vector3.zero;</code></p><p>When it was compiled (in past versions of Unity), it was equivalent to:</p><p><code class="literal">GetComponent&lt;Transform&gt;().position = Vector3.zero;</code></p><p>And, as we already mentioned in various chapters, the <code class="literal">GetComponent()</code> function is slow and it should be avoided when possible. So, you should have considered to cache the Transform component into a variable (as we did back in <a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Communicating with the Player – the User Interface" href="part0043.xhtml#aid-190861">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Communicating with the Player – the User Interface</em></span>, where we stored the reference to the UI component into a variable). Thus, in the case of the Transform, you could have done it within a <code class="literal">Start()</code> or <code class="literal">Awake()</code> function with the following line of code (of course, after have declared the <code class="literal">thisTransform</code> variable of type Transform):<code class="literal">thisTransform = GetComponent&lt;Transform&gt;(); </code></p></div><p>Other tips deal with strings, which are extensively used everywhere in Unity. However, unless you are doing particular intense string manipulation, you should avoid doing the optimizations presented here for strings, since the performance gain may not be worth the time spent and the reduction of readability of the code. Here are these tips:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Remember that if you are concatenating different strings together in a single call (which means, for example, doing in a while loop, which is not placed within a Coroutine so that it will be computed all in one frame), the memory could fill up quickly with unused string objects without giving the time to the garbage collector to clean it up. Therefore, you can use the <code class="literal">StringBuilder</code> class, which is also slightly faster.</li><li class="listitem">There are many different ways to compare different strings. However, the fastest one is the following:</li></ul></div><pre class="programlisting">        firstString.Equals(secondString, StringComparison.Ordinal); &#13;
</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The reason is that the algorithm just needs to walk (go through character by character) the two strings (which the single characters are seen as numbers, thus this method is case sensitive) to see whether any difference is found.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Playtesting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec130"/>Playtesting</h2></div></div></div><p>Test, test, test! Not only test with your target device and audience, but test, test, and test again with them! This may seem like an obvious part of the game development process, but at this stage, even when you do it by yourself and with other members of your team, it is absolutely crucial. Make sure that the game works on high-end AND low-end devices that are within the range of your specifications. A great video to watch that will give you an overview on the process is extra credits video on playtesting, which can be found here: <a class="ulink" href="http://tinyurl.com/PlaytestingExtraCredits">http://tinyurl.com/PlaytestingExtraCredits</a>.</p><p>Don't assume that if it works on your or your friends' devices that it will work on everyones'. There have been cases where games don't run on specific model of phone. Given this, test on as many as possible. However, thankfully, if you can't get a hold of a range of different devices, you are able to use an emulator to simulate it running on a particular device (or devices). Genymotion (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.genymotion.com">www.genymotion.com</a>) is a product that offers a great way to emulate different devices.</p><div class="section" title="Why are you even playtesting?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec113"/>Why are you even playtesting?</h3></div></div></div><p>The is the most fundamental question of the whole playtesting: why are you playtesting your application? Sure, the answer is obvious: to get feedback. But why? For example, do you want to see if the additional feature is necessary? Perhaps you want to find out whether the sound effects are too frequent and irritating; or perhaps they're not enough.</p><div class="section" title="Exercise"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec11"/>Exercise</h4></div></div></div><p>Call a team meeting, sit down and go through the features that your application has, what have been difficult to get working, which ones are novel/experimental, or even which ones should be removed. Has there been any informal testing that has offered an another perspective about the game? Do you need to redefine the project, and does everyone have the same concept of the game in their head? It is likely that you have already done this, even a few times, but if you haven't it is good practice to have constant reviews of your game and its development.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Whom do you need to playtest?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec114"/>Whom do you need to playtest?</h3></div></div></div><p>Whom do you want and need to playtest your game? Is it a multiplayer, single player or cooperative game? Ideally, when you are conducting a playtest, you want people who are from your target group. While they are playtesting, you'd want to encourage them to take notes, before the playtest (what are their expectations?), during the playtest (what are they thinking/feeling?), and after the playtest (what could be improved, what is good/bad about the game, what is missing, and so on).</p><div class="section" title="The solo test run"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec12"/>The solo test run</h4></div></div></div><p>It is better to test your game before you ask anyone outside of your group to test it. While this might seem like an obvious thing, but even if you think that your game is infallible, it is more than likely something doesn't work the way that it should. This is why it is important to playtest with yourself and/or your team because if you get bugs and glitches out of the way, then players spend less time trying to play your game and more time playing it to give you valuable feedback. In saying this, it is even worthwhile to playtest with a small group of others before conducting an actual playtesting session. Ideally, this could be easily done within your team itself. While you are doing this, it is useful to not only get a better idea how you want to test the application with others, but it will also help you to shape your questions about their experience for the real thing.</p></div><div class="section" title="Making it a social occasion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec13"/>Making it a social occasion</h4></div></div></div><p>The more the merrier, and it's the same with playtesting; but at the same time, make sure it is manageable with the resources that you have available to you. When you are organizing a group test, it is important to have a mix of people from both your target demographic and outside of it. This is because you can get feedback different perspective, which could offer insight into how the game works or doesn't work.</p></div><div class="section" title="Putting it within boundaries"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec14"/>Putting it within boundaries</h4></div></div></div><p>This is the same as asking whether your playtest will be public or private. At this stage, you need to ask yourself whether the game contains sensitive components that could effect the release. As a result, you may require players to sign a <span class="strong"><strong>non-disclosure agreement</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NDA</strong></span>), which prevents them from discussing the game publically, sharing screenshots, and legal consequences for doing so. In contrast, it may be fine for them to freely and openly talk about the game to anyone after they have played.</p><p>It is very important that this is made clear to playtesters in the beginning, even before they sign up. You don't want to be logging onto Facebook or Twitter with people publishing screenshots about your app when it's still being developed. Other considerations can be asking playtesters not to take any video or pictures during the actual testing, including selfies, check-ins, and social media posts. In some cases, the print screen option is disabled for this very purpose. Of course, people are smart and they find many workarounds to this. But if you have certain measures and consequences in place, ensuring that participants adhere to a set of rules prior to playtesting and acknowledge them (for example, signing an agreement), you can avoid any unwanted publicity later.</p></div><div class="section" title="Reaching out to family and friends"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec15"/>Reaching out to family and friends</h4></div></div></div><p>Now, playtesting can always start with your friends, family, and other close associates. This limits the amount of time that is required to get superficial issues out of the way, such as navigation functionality, certain aspects not working properly, and so on. Make sure that they don't tell you want you want to hear either. Family and friends know you on a more personal level and will know what you are looking for, so make sure that they are honest with their feedback and constructive with their critiques.</p></div><div class="section" title="Those who are strangers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec16"/>Those who are strangers</h4></div></div></div><p>In saying all of that, it's great to get comments from those that we know because there really isn't anything unknown and you're comfortable to communicate with them. But like we mentioned before, you need an objective opinion from someone you don't know and who doesn't know anything about your game other than the synopsis that you gave them prior to testing.</p></div><div class="section" title="Those who you want to play your game"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec17"/>Those who you want to play your game</h4></div></div></div><p>Given all this talk about people, it is important to keep in mind who you are intending your game for. For this group of users, you really need to define your target audience (age, location, and experience level). By developing a user profile early on, then you are able to define the kind of attributes that they may have and that you need to cater for. Not only will this will help you to improve the design of your game but also to define how you will need to conduct your playtest. By doing this, you are able to focus the questions that are related to the application, and to them, and find out (if it's not), what could make it more relevant.</p><p>Some simple steps that can get you refining this group of people are the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Look at who is already using your products (if you have more than one). If you don't already have a user-base, then create a list of what would be your most ideal one. Start broad and then work your way to refining it to becoming a bit more specific. This will help to improve how you also market your game later. Look at things like age group, gender, location to help develop a better picture.</li><li class="listitem">See what others, who are similar to you, are doing. This will help you to also refine (or redefine) your target audience. Make a list of games that are similar to yours and see how their audiences are being targeted.</li><li class="listitem">Analyze the products and/or services that you already have available. Have they done well, if so why, if not why not?</li><li class="listitem">Choose specific characteristics of your audience to focus on. For example, while all of them may be gamers, maybe some are more casual than others. Perhaps your game is more targeted towards adults than children, and so on. While we aim to please everyone, we can't, so it's better to a more directed focus.</li><li class="listitem">Take a step back and evaluate your target audience. Are there things that could be added to help improve or specify them?</li></ul></div><p>These are only some of the things that you will need to consider when defining your target audience, so I encourage you to also check out other, and more relevant text (on the web, books) that are more relevant to your game.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="When"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec115"/>When</h3></div></div></div><p>The time that you decide to run your play-set is also an important consideration. Especially if you require people to be physically present. When deciding on a time think about what your group would most likely to be doing at that time. For example, if your target group students, it is more than likely that during the day they will be at school, therefore, weekend testing sessions are probably going to be more suited for them. On the other hand, if your group are people who run, early mornings or after work are probably more ideal times to have sessions. Of course, these are dependent on the type of game that you have as well. If your game requires more time commitment, then having a longer period of time for them to play your game is going to be better suited both for you and their lifestyle. Remember, they are helping you, so flexibility is key.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note133"/>Note</h3><p>A good way to ensure that people will turn up on time to your test group is to either add them to your calendar or to call or send them reminder a few days before the proposed play date.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Where"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec116"/>Where</h3></div></div></div><p>If playtesting is all done virtually, either by downloading and executable or by logging in to a website, then feel free to skip this section. However, if you require participants to come to a physical location, you want to make it as accessible as possible. Ideally you want it to be somewhere that is close public transport and in an area that is likely to be a central point for people to come to. For example, a city center is generally close to public transport, and it is likely to be close to people's places of work, or even school.</p></div><div class="section" title="What"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec117"/>What</h3></div></div></div><p>What are you expecting from the playtest and what are your playtesters expecting to do are two questions that you need to consider. For example, are you wanting them to play the tutorial and then provide feedback to you, either written or verbal? Perhaps they are thinking that they will need to play the entire game. The what of your playtest is essential to define and to make clear to the playtesters, that way you're not wasting their time and they aren't wasting you by giving feedback to irrelevant parts of the application.</p><div class="section" title="A little goes a long way"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec18"/>A little goes a long way</h4></div></div></div><p>What will you provide your playtesters during playtest, and/or for their time? If you are unable to compensate them, make sure to provide food and beverages. This is not to say you need to get a caterer to provide you with cakes and sandwiches, but having tea and coffee with some snacks (cut up some fruit, chips, candy, biscuits, even make your own sandwiches) will help to keep them sharp, especially if they are there for a long time. Scheduling breaks during long playtest sessions is also important, because you don't want them to be sitting there for hours. Having breaks every 45 minutes is a great way to also check-in with them and see how things are going.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="How"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec118"/>How</h3></div></div></div><p>How are the playtesters going to, well play and how will you manage this? How are you going to get their feedback? What kind of equipment (recording devices or computers) and software (questionnaire) will you need? Prior to the test, make sure that they work, batteries are charged and you have all the necessary equipment (cables and adapters) available. In addition, make sure you have a backup plan if for some reason sometime goes wrong on the day (which it does happen).</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Methods of playtesting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec131"/>Methods of playtesting</h2></div></div></div><p>There are different ways to approach a playtest. You can let the players figure it all out on their own (after you've provided a bit of context), or guide them through the rules. With each approach, the way that you gain feedback during the playtest will differ. The following are some ways that you can playtest your game.</p><div class="section" title="Observe"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec119"/>Observe</h3></div></div></div><p>Observe how your testers are playing. For example, do they do things in a particular way or that is not expected? Perhaps this is because of a glitch or from other experiences that they have with games, and as a result they use certain features (or try to) in the same way. The same concept can happen in reverse, for example if players are supposed to obtain or do something but they don't, or the game won't allow them to then this needs to be fixed. At these points, future players are likely to find the game difficult to use because of a technical issue and head towards the <span class="strong"><strong>Uninstall</strong></span> button.</p></div><div class="section" title="Question and explain"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec120"/>Question and explain</h3></div></div></div><p>There is no better way to check your understanding of something than to explain it to someone else. Therefore, one way to get feedback from your playtesters is to ask them to explain the game to you. Do they explain something different, that has you asking if you gave them the right game? Or do they explain the game in the same way that you intended it to be like? While they are explaining the game to you, make sure that you keep the conversation on what the game is, and not what it could be. Of course, any improvements are great suggestions, but for the purpose of the explanation, you will want them to tell you what they just experienced.</p></div><div class="section" title="Reflect and follow up"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec121"/>Reflect and follow up</h3></div></div></div><p>By now, you're left with an empty testing space and a whole bunch of notes, ideas, and different thoughts whizzing around your mind. Now is the time to get them out and documented. Have a group meeting. Write it up on a whiteboard, paper, document, or somewhere that is easily accessible later. This is an important process because what happens here can greatly impact your game upon release.</p><p>Now that the playtest is over, you will want to follow up with them. It's just like being in a meeting, you think of something useful afterwards, the same goes for testing. In a week from the playtest, it might be a nice way to drop them an e-mail, thank them again for their participation and if they have thought of anything else since the playtest. The important thing here is not to spam them with e-mails and questions, but to provide them with an opportunity to suggest it. You can provide them with an online (and anonymous) questionnaire.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating your online presence"><div class="titlepage" id="aid-344B22"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec96"/>Creating your online presence</h1></div></div></div><p>These days, if it's not on the Internet, it doesn't exist. Well, if you're not social, it will be hard for people to know what you are up to, let alone knowing that you are making a game! You don't spend months or years developing something only to have no one come to the party. But this can be fixed, and it does require a bit of planning and time, so be prepared, but I promise you it will be worth it in the end.</p><div class="section" title="Do your research"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec132"/>Do your research</h2></div></div></div><p>If you're going for a job interview, you wouldn't go in there without having done a bit of research about your potential employer, the same goes for making a name for yourself. While it's good to get everyone's attention, ideally, you want to get noticed by the right people. One way to do this is to pay close attention to companies, products, and even individuals who are also in the same market as you; and observe who they interact with, what kind of social media tagging are they utilizing. For example, are they using a particular hashtag such as <span class="emphasis"><em>#Android</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>#game</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>#AppStore</em></span>? Perhaps, there are particular groups that they are targeting, from local, international, big, and small companies, even particular key individuals within the area. The idea is not to mimic their interactions, but to observe them. As you begin to observe you will learn more about the market that you are targeting, the major players, and perhaps come across and opportunity to engage with them. Such opportunities can range from conferences, expos, perhaps a meet and greet for a particular launch. Just remember, time and place is everything.</p></div><div class="section" title="Conducting an audit"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec133"/>Conducting an audit</h2></div></div></div><p>From logos to banners, links and even mission statements, a social media audit will ensure that everything is up-to-date. Do this when you first set up your social media accounts and right before you make any big announcement (such as a game launch). Of course, it is important to maintain these regularly, but if you're going to do it, these are the times to check everything is in order, because you are likely to get a higher influx of traffic to your channels.</p></div><div class="section" title="Engaging with your audience"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec134"/>Engaging with your audience</h2></div></div></div><p>If you're documenting the process, ask those who are engaging with your content for their opinions. Create polls, post questions and ask for their responses. Keep them engaged and make sure that you interact with your audience on a regular basis. Even if you're just posting an update about a day in the office or something interesting that happened during the development of your game, it keeps users interested. While posting something is good, make sure that it still somehow ties back to the game or your development studio.</p><div class="section" title="Rewarding engagement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec122"/>Rewarding engagement</h3></div></div></div><p>Sites like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and other crowdfunding platforms provide rewards for certain levels of commitment from their projects backers. Even if you choose not to engage with one of these platforms, you can adopt similar approaches to the development and eventual release of your game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Competitions</strong></span>: Running competitions is a great way to get people involved. If you don't have the funds to create products, offer discounts, early access or (free) full versions of your game. Another option is to create some exclusive artwork/wallpapers and if possible, get them printed and signed by your team.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>The power of the crowd</strong></span>: Competitions are a great way to get people interacting with your company and products. Therefore, when you want to get people involved, instead of asking them to write a comment in response to your question or competition, get them to like, share, and even tag friends to enter into the competition. Perhaps for each friend that they tag, it's an additional entry. In any case, it is a win-win situation because they (and even their friends) have the potential to win something, and you get some publicity.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Feedback</strong></span>: Getting insight from those using your product, albeit during playtesting or after the game has launched is ensuring that your game is as good as it can be. Remember to keep in mind that when take the time to give you detailed feedback, it is time out of their day, committed to helping you and your product out. While not everything is roses, and in cases you will get negative feedback, when it's constructive it can give you ideas about future updates. Therefore, while feedback tends to be altruistic, reward those who make an effort. Rewards can be simple as a discount or large like a (or chance to win) free copy of your game.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Marketing on social media"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec135"/>Marketing on social media</h2></div></div></div><p>Don't just be a lurker, get involved!

To begin, let's start with a blog. A blog offers many different avenues for communicating detailed information about what you do, albeit as a company or during the development of a product. It's one way to gather followers and provide a more personal snapshot into your lives. In this way, you begin to develop a more meaningful connection between you and your audience.</p><p>There are a range of different blog platforms to choose from. Some of the most popular ones include Tumblr (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tumblr.com">www.tumblr.com</a>), WordPress (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.wordpress.com">www.wordpress.com</a>), and Blogger (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.blogger.com">www.blogger.com</a>).

However, Twitter uses a few key methods of interaction:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Reply</strong></span>: As the name suggests it allows users to reply to what you have posted. This allows you to interact with those who have showed interest in what you have said.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Retweet</strong></span>: It is Twitter's version of sharing. So if someone tweets something that you liked, you can retweet it so that your followers can also see it.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Favorite</strong></span>: It is similar to a <span class="emphasis"><em>Like</em></span> on Facebook or a thumbs up on YouTube.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Hashtags</strong></span>: These are probably one of the most fundamental things to keep in mind when sharing content. They are like a filtering system, in terms of categorizing information. Using unique hashtags helps you to not only keep track of content distribution that is related to your game, but it also makes it easier to be heard among other tweets.</li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip134"/>Tip</h3><p>A great way to make sure that you have a unique hashtag is to search it before using it.</p></div><p>Some useful links to get you going with advertising on Twitter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="https://business.twitter.com/en/advertising.html">https://business.twitter.com/en/advertising.html</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="https://marketing.twitter.com/na/en.html">https://marketing.twitter.com/na/en.html</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/troubleshooting/how-twitter-ads-work.html">https://business.twitter.com/en/help/troubleshooting/how-twitter-ads-work.html</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="https://business.twitter.com/en/advertising/campaign-types.html">https://business.twitter.com/en/advertising/campaign-types.html</a></li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Exercise"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl4sec19"/>Exercise</h4></div></div></div><p>If you're having trouble condensing something into a short version, try putting a limit on yourself. For example, begin with stating you whole idea, then say it in 15, 10, and 5 seconds. You will begin to notice that each time you try to say your idea, the core concepts will become more obvious, and the shorter the time becomes, the more efficient and simplified your explanation will become. We often feel the need to include everything, that one piece of information is equally as important as the next, but in reality that become padding to the concept.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Instagram"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec125"/>Instagram</h3></div></div></div><p>While Twitter is the micro blogging platform, Instagram (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.instagram.com">www.instagram.com</a>) tells a thousand words with a simple picture (and caption). It works in a similar way to Twitter in that you can add hashtags, and connect with a larger audience and perhaps follow some of the key players (optional).</p></div><div class="section" title="Facebook"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec126"/>Facebook</h3></div></div></div><p>Facebook (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a>) offers a range of different options when it comes to creating a place to advertise your game as well as connecting with your audience:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Pages</strong></span>: Create a page and populate it a bit before making it public so that you have a somewhat established online presence. By having content on your page, it gives visitors a reason to stay. While they are there, you need to be able to keep them there for a bit, and there are different ways to get visitors engaged, such as having an interesting blog post about a recent update or feature to an intriguing photo.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Posts</strong></span>: These are a versatile feature to use. For example, if you're asking about a particular component for the game, such as the next feature to include, you could ask them to <span class="emphasis"><em>Like</em></span> for option one, <span class="emphasis"><em>Comment</em></span> for option two, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Share</em></span> for option three. Like we have discussed in this chapter in terms of competitions, you can use option two to encourage people to tag their friends as part of the process. As a result, while you are getting them interacting with your posts, you're also getting a bit of publicity from it all while reaching their friends networks.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Polls</strong></span>: They can be used as a way to quickly gauge users' opinions and see what the common consensus is. It is a bit more linear than post a comment (although this feature is available for the poll in general), but it is quicker. Of course, you can use polls to encourage competitive behavior such as vote now, whichever feature gets the highest amount of votes will be included in the next update. In this way, players will also feel as though their input counts and that they are also part of the development process.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Live</strong></span>: The live feature allows you to stream an event in real-time and have people watch it, well, live. This provides you with a great opportunity to stream things such as live game development or a Q&amp;A. The best part is that if people miss it, then they can view it later and interact with it (for example, via comments, likes, sharing, and so on).</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="MailChimp"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl3sec127"/>MailChimp</h3></div></div></div><p>While you're not ready, you still want a place for potential customers to keep in touch and there is no better way to do that then with a mainlining list. MailChimp (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mailchimp.com">www.mailchimp.com</a>), as well as many others out there, helps you to not only collate mailing lists but also inform them, all at once, about upcoming events, product releases, and many other special events.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Getting ready to publish"><div class="titlepage" id="aid-352RK2"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec97"/>Getting ready to publish</h1></div></div></div><p>There are a number of things, not just to do with your game or application that need to be taken care of before you finally release your precious gem into the world. In the following sections, we will go through a number of considerations, both with your team and final product, to ensure that the final part of this process is as smooth as possible.</p><div class="section" title="Crowdfunding campaigns"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec136"/>Crowdfunding campaigns</h2></div></div></div><p>There are a number of different platforms for crowdfunding campaigns and each has its own features. However, the fundamental thing about them all is that they are there to provide a place for you to gather a following and importantly the much-needed funds or you to bring your creation to light. Different crowdfunding platforms operate for different reasons. For example, some are about causes (nature, human rights, or poverty), certain types of products (clothing, music), creative (products or virtual goods), and personal (medical treatments). Your game may meet criteria on more than one, specifically for creative projects, so it is recommended that you spend some time to see where your game is likely to reach those who will be the most interested in it.</p><p>Crowdfunding platforms work by the developer (or creator of any product or idea) presenting their idea, what they need the funding for, how it will be allocated, and what's in it for the backers who will be the ones that ultimately will give you money. In general, backers for your product (in this case, game) will be offered by you, with varying levels of backing opportunities to choose from. For example, if a backer contributes $1 then they are able to have their name listed in the credits on the game's website, or even in-game. If they give you $50, then they are able to get a signed copy of your game, $800 will get them two copies and a handwritten thank-you note, and so on. Be careful when you're setting the amounts for each level. Too much and you won't get backers; too little and you will ruin your budget. One last thing to consider is that in some cases, the crowdfunding platform will not only take a certain percentage from the total amount of funds that you raise, but will also add a fee to your backer's contributions.</p><p>Therefore, before you decide on a crowdfunding platform make sure that it will be the right one for you and for the funds that you are wanting to raise.</p><p>One of the most important things is to keep the risks of your project (both if it is funded and isn't) in mind. There are many risks that can occur, especially when you do get funded that the funds are managed properly and for what they were intended for. You want to have a budget that has been planned well and takes into account likely events that may occur (delays, unexpected costs for hardware, and additional help).</p><p>We have barely scratched the surface of what it means to develop and run a crowdfunding platform, but it is not a task for the faint-hearted. A great deal of thought is required when you're determining the levels of rewards for your backers and you must their cost into consideration and whether or not that will impact your budget. For example, digital downloads of your games will definitely be more cost-effective than burning them to a disc, and housing them in a beautifully decorated case, and then shipping them where they need to go. You can either include the cost of postage in the amount that backers are required to pay or ask it to be paid separately. In any event, crowdfunding campaigns require a lot of time and effort to be run successfully. In addition, they are not always a sure way to get funding, so keep this in mind when you're planning your game and its future.</p><p>Here is a list of crowdfunding sites to check out:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Fig: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fig.co">www.fig.co</a></li><li class="listitem">Kickstarter: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.kickstarter.com">www.kickstarter.com</a></li><li class="listitem">Indiegogo: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.indiegogo.com">www.indiegogo.com</a></li><li class="listitem">RocketHub: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.rockethub.com">www.rockethub.com</a></li><li class="listitem">GoFundMe: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gofundme.com">www.gofundme.com</a></li><li class="listitem">Razoo: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.razoo.com">www.razoo.com</a></li><li class="listitem">CrowdRise: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.crowdrise.com">www.crowdrise.com</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Building in Unity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec137"/>Building in Unity</h2></div></div></div><p>The first thing to do is to actually compile the game. Otherwise, you won't be able to put it anywhere!</p><p>To build a game in Unity, you need to navigate in the top bar menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>File | Build Settings…</strong></span>.

More importantly, make sure that everyone has been accounted for. For example, how the profits/royalties will be divided, their responsibilities post game launch, and so forth. Of course, this would have been outlined in a contract early on in the project, which they would have signed, but we are all guilty of agreeing to terms and conditions without having actually read them. It might even be worthwhile at this stage to remind everyone to revisit their contract.</p></div><div class="section" title="Accepting terms and conditions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec139"/>Accepting terms and conditions</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that your team are all good to go, you need to make sure that what you're about to put out there for the world to enjoy also abides by the terms and conditions of the platform that you will be targeting. For example, if you are planning to release for Android devices, ensure that you have met their terms and conditions; the same goes for Apple's App Store and any others that you are intending to publish on.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Localization" id="aid-361C61"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec98"/>Localization</h1></div></div></div><p>When you are shipping worldwide, you need to localize your game. Many developers think that publishing only in English should be enough because it is understood by most gamers. However, if you give a look to the marketing and downloading graphs, it's clear that English is just 20% of the market. Therefore, you should definitely take into consideration localizing your game to other audiences.</p><p>But localization is much more than just translating your game and/or adding subtitles in other languages. There are so many things you should keep in consideration. Some of the many reasons are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">In some languages, like German, some words are really long and they might be cut off or overflow from your user interface.</li><li class="listitem">Some languages, such as Arabic are written in a different direction, for instance, right to left or up to down. Thus, you may have to adjust the design of your UI to support the visual impact that your interface will have.</li><li class="listitem">In case you have dialogue systems, or just the user interface that uses string concatenation in a certain way within the code, be aware than in other languages, they need to be rewritten if they are not flexible enough! An example would be when you want to place an adjective before the word. In some other languages, it might happen in the opposite direction. For instance, the English sentence the <span class="emphasis"><em>red hat</em></span> becomes <span class="emphasis"><em>il cappello rosso</em></span> in Italian, where <span class="emphasis"><em>rosso</em></span> means red. Thus, the adjective is after the word and not before it, unlike in English. Another (practical) example is the following: you reserve an extra character at the end of your item to add an <span class="emphasis"><em>s</em></span> to make it plural (<span class="emphasis"><em>potion</em></span> can become <span class="emphasis"><em>potions</em></span>). In Italian, you don't need an extra character but change the last one (<span class="emphasis"><em>pozione</em></span> becomes <span class="emphasis"><em>pozioni</em></span> in the plural form). Moreover, in Italian the last character that changes depends on whether the object is female or male (a concept that doesn't exist in English, since objects don't have any sex). Therefore, your solution to reserve a character is not structured enough to support Italian. Imagine applying this to all the other languages, and you quickly realize that it's not so easy to localize you game by just adding a couple of variables.</li><li class="listitem">In some cultures, the role of the <span class="emphasis"><em>,</em></span> and of the <span class="emphasis"><em>.</em></span> is inverted within numbers (For example the number 3,218 can be interpreted as three thousand two hundred eighteen or also as three point two one eight, such as in Italy).</li><li class="listitem">In some cultures, specific concepts might be not well tolerated, and therefore they should be censured or removed. This is typically with violent games or games that contain certain types of adult content.</li></ul></div><p>All of these problems should be taken into consideration when you translate because it's not as straightforward as getting the translation of your text. Here is a list of examples, by no means exhaustive:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Translators need to have the context of the game, because in other languages, many shades are lost with direct translation, and in some way, they should be kept when possible</li><li class="listitem">Biographies of characters are useful in case your collaborators do voice casting for other languages</li><li class="listitem">Some metaphors or sayings may have no meaning in other languages</li></ul></div><p>As such, you should consider localization from the very beginning of your development flow. However, this is often not possible due time and economic constraints. In any case, keep in mind that the sooner you pay attention to localization, the easier it will be in the long run.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Ethical considerations" id="aid-36VSO1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec99"/>Ethical considerations</h1></div></div></div><p>Video games are a technology, and like all technologies, they can be dangerous and harm people. They can be used as weapons to hurt people. Unfortunately, this ethical aspect of games is often forgotten. As such, I want to quote Jesse Schell, who wrote in his book (<span class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Game Design: a book of lenses</em></span>):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"If you are designing a game that involves strangers talking each other, you must take responsibility for what that might lead to. This is one of the rare cases where your choices in game design could cause lives to be saved or lost. You might think there is a one in a million chance of something dangerous happening in your game, but if that is true, and your game is so successful that five million people play it, that dangerous thing will happen five times."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>You, as a game developer, have certain responsibilities in doing everything you could to make this never happen. If you are not willing to take such responsibilities, probably it's better not to make any game.</p><p>In my personal opinion, which is also shared by Jesse Schell as you can read from his book, you have the potential to do something good, and use video games as a tool to enhance human life. You should be inspired by questions like, Is the game I'm developing doing something good? and Can my game in some way improve the life of its players? Of course, these are not questions that game companies care about, but you as game developer should, and answer them inside you. Then, try to make your game a better game for people.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note135"/>Note</h3><p>The same argument, but explained in more detail, can be found in a dedicated chapter of Jesse Schell's book.</p></div><p>Please, in your own way, make this world a better place!</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary" id="aid-37UDA1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec100"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we faced many topics, and explored many areas, so let's reorganize our ideas.</p><p>At the beginning, we discussed about potential improvements for our tower defense game and some hints on their implementation. From there, we extended the improvements to Unity in general, by providing more areas of game development that we didn't have time to cover in detail, but that need your attention if you wish to improve your own skills.</p><p>During game development, you are often not alone, but you are within a team, and it is important that each part of the team works as if they all were one (like the human body) so to achieve the finest results. As such, some collaboration tools have been highlighted, so that you are free to try them and choose the one that suits your team best.</p><p>Then, we came back to our game, by focusing on optimization and playtesting, which are both wrongly considered as last steps of the game development pipeline, but as we found out, this is not true. The sooner you start iterating on them, the better your game will be. Optimization is needed to run your game efficiently, whereas playtesting is needed to make player's experience smooth.</p><p>We didn't stop there, and we went through what's after the game is completed, and we discussed topics ranging from marketing your game, creating an online presence to publish your game, and hopefully get a revenue out of it. As such, we explored many hints on how to use the most common social media platforms as tools to promote your image and your game by engaging and expand your target audience.</p><p>At the very end, we scratched the surface of localization, just to have a better idea of what's behind that, since we didn't have the time to face it properly, but it was worthy of mention.</p></div>
