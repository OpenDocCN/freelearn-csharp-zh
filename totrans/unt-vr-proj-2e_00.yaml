- en: Today, we are witnesses to the burgeoning of **virtual realit**y (**VR**), an
    exciting new technology and creative medium that promises to transform how we
    interact with our information, friends, and the world at large in a fundamental
    way.

- en: Wearing a VR **head-mounted display** (**HMD**), you can view stereoscopic 3D
    scenes. You can look around by moving your head, walk around the space with room-scale
    tracking, and interact with virtual objects with positional hand controllers.
    With VR, you engage in fully immersive experiences. It's like you're really in
    some other virtual world.

- en: This book takes a practical, project-based approach to teach you the specifics
    of virtual reality development using the Unity 3D game engine. We walk through
    a series of hands-on projects, step-by-step tutorials, and in-depth discussions
    using Unity 2018 and other free or open source software. While VR technology is
    rapidly advancing, we'll try to capture the basic principles and techniques you
    can use to make your own VR games and applications immersive and comfortable.

- en: You will learn how to use Unity to develop VR applications that can be experienced
    with devices such as the Oculus Rift, Google Daydream, HTC VIVE, and others. We'll
    cover technical considerations that are especially important and possibly unique
    to VR. By the end of this book, you will be equipped to develop rich and interactive
    virtual reality experiences.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Years ago, I studied 3D computer graphics in college and user interface design
    in graduate school and then started a small software company developing a 3D graphics
    engine for managing AutoCAD engineering drawings. We sold the business to Autodesk.
    In the ensuing years, I focused on 2D web app development, blogged about my technical
    adventures, and pursued several new startups. Then, in the March of 2014, I read
    about Facebook purchasing Oculus for $2B; that certainly piqued my interest. I
    immediately ordered my first VR headset, the Oculus DK2 developer kit, and began
    developing small VR projects in Unity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In February 2015, I had the idea to write a book on Unity VR development. Packt
    accepted my proposal right away, and suddenly I realized, "Oh no! I have to do
    this!" Within 6 months, in August 2015, the first edition of this book was published.
    That's a short time to go from proposal to outline to chapter drafts to review
    to final draft and publication. I was obsessed. At the time, I told my wife that
    I feel the book has a life of its own, "it's inside of me and struggling to get
    out, I just have to get out of its way." She replied, "It sounds like you're pregnant."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the time of that writing, the Google Cardboard was a thing, but there were
    no consumer VR devices. The DK2 had no hand controllers, just an XBox game controller.
    Months after the book was released, in November 2015, the HTC Vive came to market
    with room scale and positionally tracked hand controllers. In March 2016, the
    Oculus Rift consumer version was released. Not until December 2016, almost a year
    and a half after the book came out, did Oculus release its positionally tracked
    Touch hand controllers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the first edition of this book, many new VR devices have come to market,
    hardware and software features have improved, and the Unity game engine continues
    to add native VR SDK integrations and new features to support them. Oculus, Google,
    Steam, Samsung, PlayStation, Microsoft, and many others have joined the fray as
    the industry continues to accelerate and blossom.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meanwhile, in 2016, I coauthored another book with Packt, *Cardboard VR Projects
    for Android*, a non-Unity VR book using Java and Android Studio to build Google
    Daydream and cardboard applications. (In that book, you build and use your own
    home-grown 3D graphics engine for mobile devices). Then in 2017, I coauthored
    a third book with Packt, *Augmented Reality for Developers*, an exciting and timely
    Unity-based projects' book for AR applications on iOS, Android, and HoloLens devices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the time came to begin this second edition of *Unity Virtual Reality Projects*,
    I expected it to be a relatively simple task of updating to the current version
    of Unity, adding support for positionally tracked hand controllers, plus a few
    tweaks here and there. Not so simple! While much of the fundamentals and advice
    in the first edition did not change, as an industry, we have learned a lot in
    these few short years. For example, it's really not a great idea to implement
    a trampoline in VR (one of our projects that got scrapped in this edition), as
    that can really cause motion sickness!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this second edition, the book is significantly revised and expanded. Every
    chapter and project has been updated. We separated some topics into their own
    chapters with completely new projects, such as the audio fireball game ([Chapter
    8](77d724d8-4ba8-4991-b4c0-35f4ea1c70b6.xhtml), *Playing with Physics and Fire*),
    animation ([Chapter 11](7225d26e-8e3f-4dac-b87c-2b9d594bf6e1.xhtml), *Animation
    and VR Storytelling*), and optimization ([Chapter 13](c938e975-93f3-4435-9d99-9f76bbbd0a98.xhtml),
    *Optimizing for Performance and Comfort*). I sincerely hope you find this book
    fun, educational, and helpful, as we all aim to create great new VR content and
    explore this amazing new medium.

- en: If you are interested in virtual reality, want to learn how it works, or want
    to create your own VR experiences, this book is for you. Whether you're a non-programmer
    and are unfamiliar with 3D computer graphics, or experienced in both but new to
    virtual reality, you will benefit from this book. Any experience in Unity is an
    advantage. If you are new to Unity, you too can pick up this book, although you
    might first want to work through some of Unity's own getting-started tutorials
    available on their website ([https://unity3d.com/learn](https://unity3d.com/learn)).
  prefs: []

- en: Game developers may already be familiar with the concepts in this book reapplied
    to the VR projects while learning many other ideas specific to VR. Mobile and
    2D game designers who already know how to use Unity will discover another dimension!
    Engineers and 3D designers may understand many of the 3D concepts, but learn to
    use the Unity engine for VR. Application developers may appreciate the potential
    non-gaming uses of VR and may want to learn the tools to make that happen.
