- en: A requirement of the Unity Programmer Exam is not only to be confident with
    your C# programming skills but also to be familiar with what the Unity Editor
    offers in terms of its components and tools. Therefore, in this chapter, we will
    do no programming and, instead, focus on our **User Interface** (**UI**), which
    consists of **Image** and **Text** components. It's also worth mentioning that
    we will make our UI expand and contract with the screen's ratio size, which isn't
    possible with 3D assets alone (please refer to the previous chapter for more details).
    We will also import and apply our own custom font while we learn about our **Text**
    component. Finally, we will animate the UI with **Animator** and make use of the
    **Animator Controller**, which involves creating our own states.

  prefs:

- en: The purpose of the Canvas is to typically hold images and text in a 2D world.
    Its primary purpose is to allow the user to interact with things, such as clicking
    on buttons, pushing volume sliders, and turning knobs, which is more commonly
    known as the UI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unity (quite confusingly) makes it such that the 2D Canvas also shares the same
    space as it's a 3D world. Therefore, in our scene, we will typically have a large
    canvas area with the UI; then, further down in the bottom left of the screen,
    we will have our 3D world.

    the **Game** view showing a 3D cube and UI **Button**. On the left-hand side,
    we have the **Scene** view showing the same cube but with the **Button** missing.
    This is because, in the **Scene** window, the Canvas that holds the UI button
    is located in its own 2D space. To resolve this issue, we need to zoom out of
    the **Scene** view, and we will see where the UI button is located. Additionally,
    we will see the outline of a large white rectangle that represents the screen
    ratio.

    scene (killer wave title screen) and pasted the game objects to the existing scenes
    (level title and game over) to act as a template for the game's theme. Once these
    components were in place, we simply modified the text field (changing the text
    from killer wave to level 1 and so on).
