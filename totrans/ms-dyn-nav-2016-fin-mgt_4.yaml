    analysis, for example, would be sales per area. In a more complex scenario, we
    could also analyze sales per sales campaign, per customer group, and per area.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to be able to analyze those dimensions you have to make sure that each
    and every single entry contains the information needed. In Dynamics NAV, a dimension
    can be seen as information linked to an entry, such as a tag or a characteristic.
    The purpose of dimensions is to group entries with similar characteristics so
    that you can report on the data in a way that is meaningful to the company.

    data. Each dimension can have unlimited dimension values that are subunits of
    the dimension. For example, a dimension called `Department` can have subunits
    called `Sales, Administration`, and so on. These departments are dimension values.

    but to narrow down calculations. Some of the information you see in the application
    is actually a calculation based on other information. For instance, the balance
    for customers and vendors is actually a calculation based on their ledger entries.
    So are inventories on items or the balance on general ledger accounts.

    after applying a date flowfilter, the **Net Change** field gets updated and shows
    only the sum of G/L entry amounts of the specified period, while the **Balance**
    field has remained the same. This is because of the definition of the fields.
    The definition of the **Net Change** field states that the calculation for this

    are a tool for tagging all our ledger entries. They allow you to analyze the data
    saved in the system in a manner that is useful to your company. We have learned
    to analyze data on screen, using filters, flowfilters, and charts. We have also
    learned about reports, an out of the box way of analyzing data. Account schedules
    are a tool that helps us analyze data from ledger entries, and so are analysis
    views. Analysis views are also useful to analyze financial groups by dimensions.
    Finally, we saw how to link Excel with our Dynamics NAV database to be able to
    use the Business Intelligence tools included in Excel.
