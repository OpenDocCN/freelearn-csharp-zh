- en: This section includes the first three chapters of the book. The idea is to make
    sure you understand how to transform user requirements into the actual architectural
    needs that are essential for project success, using the various architectural
    aspects and design considerations involved in developing enterprise applications
    with C# and .NET Core.

- en: In [Chapter 1](14b5c5da-4042-439e-9e5a-2e19ba4c4930.xhtml), *Understanding the
    Importance of Software Architecture*, we will discuss the importance of software
    architecture and aspects related to .NET Core and C#. The chapter will also discuss
    the importance of analyzing software requirements and designing for principles
    such as scalability and robustness. No matter what software development cycle
    you decide to have in your project, analyzing requirements will help you adhere
    to the goal of the project. Without this, the success of your project is at risk.
    This chapter will present some use cases where a lack of understanding of the
    requirements gathered led to project failures. Besides this, in each case, we
    will provide practical advice that could help to protect your software from the
    scenarios presented.

    2](a4194162-692d-4ac4-9b8e-a48199e746ab.xhtml), *Functional and Nonfunctional
    Requirements*, we will prompt you to think about the impacts that the requirements
    have on the architectural design. Scalability, performance, multithreading, interoperability,
    and other subjects will be discussed, both their theory and their practice.

    *Documenting Requirements with Azure DevOps*, we will present Azure DevOps, which
    is the tool currently being provided by Microsoft to enable an application development
    life cycle that follows the principles of the DevOps philosophy. There are a variety
    of good features that can help you document and organize your software, and the
    purpose of the chapter is to present an overview of those features.
