<div><p class="calibre_1">Preface</p><p class="calibre_2">As the authors of this book, we promise you an honest, unfiltered, and highly practical guide to the art and craft of game design.</p><p class="calibre_2">To begin with, we have to acknowledge that there are great benefits to learning more about the history of games, the nature of human behavior, and the theory of play. Also, there's great material out there (some of it referenced in this very book) that we can wholeheartedly recommend that you explore!</p><p class="calibre_2">However, our medium is rapidly evolving, and when it comes to working as a game designer in the modern day and age, there appears to be a gap; we took upon ourselves the tremendous task of trying to fill it.</p><p class="calibre_2">Our goal is to not only share our knowledge on game design but also to shed light on how to work in a modern development team. From game concept to release and well into live operations, years of experience, blood, sweat, and post-crunch tears and distilled into practical and applicable knowledge.</p><p class="calibre_2">We've done our best to gather actionable insight and valuable advice on game design across genres, development platforms, and business models, and we are very humbled by the ability to share it with the world!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Who this book is for</p><p class="calibre_2">Whether you are a student just approaching the discipline, an existing game designer, or a developer looking to expand your knowledge, this book will equip you with the fundamental know-how and best practices to help you succeed in your career.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">What this book covers</p><p class="calibre_2"><a href="index_split_032.html#filepos105483"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 1</tt></a>, Introducing the Game Production Process, explores the basic machinations of the games industry, teaching you about various game design roles, responsibilities of designers, production methods, and development milestones.</p><p class="calibre_2"><a href="index_split_047.html#filepos149451"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 2</tt></a>, Game Concept, teaches you how to write a game concept and your responsibilities as a game designer in the process of doing so. Practical tips and real-life examples will help you create your very own game concept based on an original idea or an existing game.</p><p class="calibre_2"><a href="index_split_070.html#filepos210445"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 3</tt></a>, Scoping a Game Project, covers the concepts and relationships between the game's overall scope, its structure, and its content.
