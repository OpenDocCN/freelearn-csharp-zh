    will create our application, and by studying the working of this application,
    we will learn the features of Visual Studio. We will also design our interface
    and validate our data. By the end of this chapter, we will have the final design
    of our application.

    controls to our form. After I finished the design process, I found that this was
    the suitable form size; you can change form size and all controls sizes as you

- en: When you start designing your application, you need to think of some facts,
    such as performance and graphical user interface (GUI). One of the most important
    rules you need to take into account to build a good application is the ease of
    use. You need to make sure that the user is comfortable with your application.
    Reduce the amount of data that the user has to enter into your application. In
    our application therefore, you will see that we use **GroupBox** more than **Textbox**
    because selecting data is easy and safe when we use **GroupBox**. We will see
    how to fill all GroupBox controls with the corresponding data in the next chapter.
