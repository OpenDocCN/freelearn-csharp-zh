			<p><strong class="bold">Augmented reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">AR</strong>) is widely recognized as the next-generation computing platform where digital content is seamlessly merged into real-world experiences. This book will help get you started with developing your own AR applications using the Unity 3D game engine and the AR Foundation toolkit provided by Unity.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will take your first steps by setting up your computer for AR development using the Unity 3D game engine. We will begin by briefly defining augmented reality, thus setting the context for this industry and some of the basics of AR technology. We will then install the Unity software, the AR Foundation toolkit, and make sure your system has been set up to develop for Android and/or iOS mobile devices. Finally, we'll build and run a test scene to verify things are working as they should.</p>
			<p>We will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Defining augmented reality</li>
				<li>Getting started with Unity, including installation and using Unity</li>
				<li>Preparing your project for AR development, including XR plugins, AR Foundation, Input System, and the Universal Render Pipeline</li>
				<li>Setting up for mobile development (Android ARCore and iOS ARKit)<p class="callout-heading">Note for Experienced Readers</p><p class="callout">If you are already familiar with Unity, already have it installed on your system, and are set up to build for your iOS or Android mobile device, you may be able to skim through details related to those topics that are interspersed in this chapter.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>First, you need a PC or Mac that's capable of running Unity. The minimum requirements are not difficult; almost any PC or Mac today will be sufficient (see <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html</a>).</p>
			<p>If you are developing for iOS, you will need a Mac running OSX with the current version of XCode installed, and an Apple developer account. If you are developing for Android, you can use either a Windows PC or Mac. We will discuss this further throughout this chapter.</p>
			<p>It is not practical to develop for AR without a device capable of running your application. For this chapter (and this book as a whole), you will need either an iOS device that supports Apple <em class="italic">ARKit</em> (search the web as Apple does not appear to publish a list; for example, <a href="https://ioshacker.com/iphone/arkit-compatibility-list-iphone-ipad-ipod-touch">https://ioshacker.com/iphone/arkit-compatibility-list-iphone-ipad-ipod-touch</a>) or an Android device that supports <em class="italic">ARCore</em> (<a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices">https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices</a>). </p>
			<p>Because this chapter is largely about installing tools and packages according to your requirements, please work through the topics in this chapter for additional technical requirements and to learn how to install them. The GitHub repository for this book can be found at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Augmented-Reality-with-Unity-AR-Foundation">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Augmented-Reality-with-Unity-AR-Foundation</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Defining Augmented Reality</h1>
			<p>According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the word <em class="italic">augment</em> means "to make greater, more numerous, larger, or more intense," while <em class="italic">reality</em> is defined as "the quality or <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>state of being real." Considering this, we realize that "augmented reality" is all about using digital content to improve our real world to add better information, understanding, and value to our experiences. </p>
			<p>Augmented reality is most commonly associated with <em class="italic">visual</em> augmentation, where computer-generated graphics are combined with actual real-world visuals. When using a handheld mobile phone or tablet, for instance, AR combines graphics with the on-screen video (I call this <em class="italic">video see-through</em> AR). Using wearable AR glasses, graphics are directly added to your visual field (<em class="italic">optical see-through</em> AR). </p>
			<p>But AR is not simply a computer graphic overlay. In his acclaimed 1997 research report, <em class="italic">A Survey of Augmented Reality</em> (<a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/ARpresence.pdf">http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/ARpresence.pdf</a>), Ronald Azuma proposed that AR must meet the following <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">Combines the real and virtual</em>: The virtual objects are perceived as real-world objects that are sharing the physical space around you. </li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li><em class="italic">Interactive in real time</em>: AR is experienced in real time, not pre-recorded. For example, cinematic special effects that combine real action with computer graphics do not count as AR.  <ul><li><em class="italic">Registered in 3D</em>: The graphics must be registered to real-world 3D locations. For example, a <strong class="bold">heads-up display</strong> (<strong class="bold">HUD</strong>) where information is simply overlayed <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>in the visual field is not AR.</li></ul></li>
			</ol>
			<p>To register a virtual object in 3D, the AR device must have the ability to track its location in 3D space and map the surrounding environment to place objects in the scene. There are multiple technologies and techniques <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>for positional and orientation tracking (together referred to as <em class="italic">pose tracking</em>), as well as environmental feature detection, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">Geolocation</em>: GPS provides<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> low-resolution tracking of your location on the Earth (GPS accuracy is measured in feet or meters). This is usually good enough for wayfinding in a city and identifying nearby businesses, for example, but not for more specific positioning.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Image Tracking</em>: Images <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>from the device's camera can be used to match the predefined or real-time 2D images, such as QR code markers, game cards, or product packaging, to display AR graphics that track an image's pose (3D position and orientation) relative to the camera space.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Motion Tracking</em>: Using<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> the device's camera and other sensors (including inertial measurement by IMU motion sensors), you can compute your position and orientation in 3D, and detect visually distinct features in the environment. Academically, you <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>may see this referred to as <strong class="bold">Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLAM</strong>).</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Environmental Understanding</em>: As features are detected in the environment, such as X-Y-Z<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> location depth points, they can be clusters to identify horizontal and vertical planes, as well as other shapes in 3D. These can be used by your application for object placement and interaction with real-world objects.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Face and Object Tracking</em>: Augmented selfie pictures use the camera to detect faces and map a 3D mesh <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>that can be used to add a face mask or other (often humorous) enhancements to your image. Likewise, other shaped objects can be recognized and tracked, as may be required for industrial applications.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this book, we will be using many of these techniques in real projects with Unity's AR Foundation toolkit, so that you can learn how to build a wide variety of AR applications. And we'll also be learning many other details and capabilities offered by Unity and AR software, all of which we'll use to improve the quality and realism of your graphics and provide engaging interactive experiences for your users.</p>
			<p>Like all technologies, AR can potentially be used for better or for worse. A great exposé on a hypothetical disturbing future, where AR is ubiquitous and as consuming as today's mobile media <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>technologies, can be found in this 2016 <em class="italic">Hyper-Reality</em> ar<a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>t video by Keiichi Matsuda (<a href="http://hyper-reality.co/">http://hyper-reality.co/</a>). Hopefully, you can help build a better future! </p>

			</ul>
			<p>Let's start developing AR applications with Unity. First, you'll need to install Unity on your development computer.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Getting started with Unity</h1>
			<p>To develop AR applications with Unity, you need to install Unity on your development machine. In this <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>section, we'll step through the installation process using Unity Hub, create a new Unity project, and introduce the basics of using the Unity Editor interface. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Installing Unity Hub</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Unity Hub</strong> is a desktop application that serves as a portal to many of the resources developers may <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>need to use Unity in their workflows. For now, we'll be using the <strong class="bold">Installs</strong> menu to install a version of the Unity Editor. Then, we'll use the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> menu to create and manage our Unity projects. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Please download and install the <strong class="bold">Unity Hub</strong> program from <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download</a>. Generally, you'll always want to use Unity Hub to install versions of Unity rather than downloading a Unity version installer directly. </li>
				<li>If you haven't already, you may need to activate a Unity <strong class="bold">User License</strong>. This is free for the <em class="italic">Student</em> and <em class="italic">Community</em> plans; you can decide to upgrade to <em class="italic">Plus</em> or <em class="italic">Pro</em> at a later time. All license plans include the same versions of Unity; no features are disabled for free plans. The paid plans add access to professional cloud services that are very useful but not necessary for project development. </li>
				<li>Use the <strong class="bold">Download Unity Hub</strong> button, as shown in the following screenshot (you may need to agree to the <em class="italic">Terms of Service</em> first):<div><img src="img/Figure_1.02-download-hub.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2 – Installing Unity Hub instead of downloading Unity directly&#13;&#10;" width="842" height="458"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.2 – Installing Unity Hub instead of downloading Unity directly</p></li>
				<li>With Unity Hub <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>installed and open, you'll see menus for <strong class="bold">Learn</strong> and <strong class="bold">Community</strong>. <p>Clicking <strong class="bold">Learn</strong> takes you to <em class="italic">Unity Learn</em> projects and tutorials (including downloads for the various project assets). These can range from 5-minute tutorials to projects that take 15 hours to complete! </p><p>The <strong class="bold">Community</strong> menu provides links to many other Unity-hosted resources, including <em class="italic">Unity Now</em> conference talks, <em class="italic">Unity Blog</em>, <em class="italic">Answers</em>, <em class="italic">Q&amp;As</em>, and <em class="italic">Forums</em>. </p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, let's install a version of the Unity Editor.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Installing a Unity Editor</h2>
			<p>When starting a new project, I like to use the latest <code>.README</code> file of this book's GitHub repository. Install a copy of the Unity Editor now, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the <strong class="bold">Installs</strong> tab, then press <strong class="bold">ADD</strong> to open the <strong class="bold">Add Unity Version</strong> box. </li>
				<li>From here, you can select a version of Unity to install. <p class="callout-heading">Note – Unity Versions</p><p class="callout">In the current Unity version numbering system, the major release number (for example, Unity <strong class="bold">2020</strong>.x.x) loosely correlates with calendar years. The most stable versions are ones designated <strong class="bold">LTS</strong>, for <strong class="bold">Long-Term Support</strong>; for example, <em class="italic">Unity 2020.3.14f1 (LTS)</em>. LTS versions receive periodic maintenance and security updates but no new features. Point releases lower than LTS (for example, <em class="italic">Unity 2021</em><strong class="bold">.1</strong><em class="italic">.15f1</em>) are considered technical releases, which are reasonably stable while new features and bug fixes are currently in development. For the more adventurous, Beta and Alpha prereleases include cutting-edge features but with added risks. </p></li>
				<li>Once you've selected the version of Unity you wish to install, click <strong class="bold">Next</strong> to see the <strong class="bold">Add modules to your install</strong> options. Here, you want to know what platforms and devices you expect to target with your projects. <p>Module <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>software can be quite large and may take time to install, so only pick what you know you will need soon. You can always come back later and add (or remove) modules as needed. Specifically, if you are developing your AR project for Android and ARCore, choose <strong class="bold">Android Build Support</strong>. If you are targeting iOS and ARKit, choose <strong class="bold">iOS Build Support</strong>. Likewise, if you are targeting other devices such as HoloLens or Magic Leap, choose the corresponding modules. </p></li>
				<li>Depending on the modules you selected, you may need to press <strong class="bold">Next</strong> and accept an additional user license agreement. Then, press <strong class="bold">Done</strong> to download and install the software.<p class="callout-heading">Tip – Where to Install Unity</p><p class="callout">Using the <strong class="bold">gear</strong> icon in the top-right of the Unity Hub window opens a <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong> window. Under the <strong class="bold">General</strong> preference tab, you can select the folder where your <strong class="bold">User Editors</strong> are installed on your computer. Since these can take up a considerable amount of disk space, you may not want to use the default location.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you have <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>any problems with Unity Hub or otherwise want to join in with discussions, visit the relevant section of the Unity community discussion forum at <a href="https://forum.unity.com/forums/unity-hub.142/">https://forum.unity.com/forums/unity-hub.142/</a>. </p>
			<p>Now, you're ready to create your first Unity project.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Creating and managing Unity projects</h2>
			<p>You will use Unity Hub to create new Unity projects. Projects are created in a specific folder on <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>your system, with a set of subfolders populated with default <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>settings and content based on the starting template you choose. Projects are opened with a specific version of Unity and continue to be associated with that specific version. To start a new project, complete the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the Unity Hub, select the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> tab, and then click the <strong class="bold">New</strong> button. Notice the down arrow of the <strong class="bold">New</strong> button, which lets you select a Unity version to use for the new project that's different from the one you currently have installed.</li>
				<li>The <code>D:\Documens\UnityProjects</code>: <div><img src="img/Figure_1.03-new-project.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3 – Creating a new project with the URP template in Unity Hub&#13;&#10;" width="1047" height="515"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.3 – Creating a new project with the URP template in Unity Hub</p><p class="callout-heading">Note – We're Using the Universal Render Pipeline</p><p class="callout">Unity offers multiple alternative render pipelines. The legacy "built-in" render pipeline sports better <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>support from older third-party assets as it came before the newer <strong class="bold">Scriptable Render Pipeline</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRP</strong>) system (<a href="https://unity.com/srp">https://unity.com/srp</a>), but the newer SRP-based pipelines are more performant and flexible. These <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>include the <strong class="bold">High Definition Render Pipeline</strong> (<strong class="bold">HDRP</strong>) for high-quality rendering using high-end graphics <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>hardware. There's also the <strong class="bold">Universal Render Pipeline</strong> (<strong class="bold">URP</strong>), which is very fast, even on mobile devices, while providing excellent rendering quality. I recommend starting new AR projects with URP. </p><p class="callout-heading">Tip – Avoid Spaces in Project Names</p><p class="callout">At the time of writing, there's a bug in some ARCore features that require that your project pathname contains no spaces, including the project name and all folder names up the tree. </p></li>
				<li>After pressing <strong class="bold">Create</strong>, it may take a few moments for Unity to create your new project, import the default assets, and perform other setup steps before opening the Unity Editor window.<p class="callout-heading">Tip – Upgrading Unity Projects</p><p class="callout">A great thing <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>about Unity Hub is its ability to manage multiple versions of Unity and all your Unity projects. I tend to start new projects with the latest official release, though inevitably, new versions of the Unity Editor will be released. In general, it's best to stick with the version of Unity you used to create your project. If you need to upgrade to a newer version, do so cautiously and deliberately. </p><p class="callout">Generally, going to a new minor update (for example, Unity 2021.2.<strong class="bold">3</strong> to 2021.2.<strong class="bold">16</strong>) is safe. Going to a point release (for example, Unity 2021.<strong class="bold">2.x</strong> to 2021.<strong class="bold">3.x</strong>) is usually OK but you may encounter unexpected problems. Upgrading to a new major release is an unusual event for me in my projects. In any of these cases, be sure that your project has been backed up (for example, on GitHub) before opening the project in a different version of Unity, and schedule time to resolve unforeseen problems. </p><p class="callout">Unity includes automated tools to facilitate upgrading a project to a new version when it's opened in Unity. Your assets will be reimported. While upgrading to newer versions is supported, downgrading to a previous version is not.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>When I create <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>a new project in Unity, one of the first things I do <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>is set <strong class="bold">Target Platform</strong> in <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong> to the first platform that I know I will be using to develop and test my project. There are advantages to doing this as early as possible, as any new assets you add to the project will be imported and processed for your target platform. You are not <em class="italic">required</em> to do this now, but I do recommend that you perform the following steps. We will go into more detail later in this chapter (in the platform-specific topic sections). </p>
			<p>With your project opened in Unity, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong> window by going to <strong class="bold">File | Build Settings</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Platform</strong> selection panel, choose your target platform. For example, if you're developing for Android ARCore, select <strong class="bold">Android</strong>, while if you're developing for Apple ARKit, choose <strong class="bold">iOS</strong>. <p>If the platform you require is not listed or is disabled, you may have forgotten to add the platform build module when you installed this version of Unity. Use <strong class="bold">Unity Hub</strong> to add the module now.</p><p class="callout-heading">Tip – You Can Add Target Platform Modules via Unity Hub</p><p class="callout">If you are missing support for a target platform, open <strong class="bold">Unity Hub</strong>, click <strong class="bold">Installs</strong>, and then, for the specific Unity version you're using, click the 3-dot context menu and choose <strong class="bold">Add Modules</strong>. From there, you can use the checkboxes to add new modules.</p></li>
				<li>You don't need <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>to worry about the other build settings <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>right now. Press the <strong class="bold">Switch Platform</strong> button. It may take a few minutes to reimport your project's assets.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>At this point, your Unity Editor should have opened a new Unity project, showing a default URP <strong class="bold">SampleScene</strong>. Feel free to explore the editor windows and scene objects. It may look daunting at first, but we'll review the user interface next to help you get more comfortable.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Introducing the Unity Editor interface</h2>
			<p>When you open the Unity Editor for the first time, you will notice that it has a lot of separate <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>window panels that contain different content. Let's explore these together. </p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows <strong class="bold">Unity Editor</strong> with the Universal Render Pipeline template's <strong class="bold">SampleScene</strong>. The windows are arranged in a default layout. This "under construction" scene demonstrates many of the awesome rendering features of Unity that may or may not be relevant in an AR project. But let's focus on Unity itself for a moment:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.04-default-layout-numbered.jpg" alt="Figure 1.4 – Unity Editor with the URP sample scene open&#13;&#10;" width="1222" height="750"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.4 – Unity Editor with the URP sample scene open</p>
			<p>The Unity Editor is <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>arranged in a layout of separate tabbed windows. An <strong class="bold">Editor window</strong> is a UI panel containing specific types of information and controls. More windows <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>can be opened via the <strong class="bold">Window</strong> main menu. Let's review each window in the preceding screenshot and introduce some other fundamental terminology since you're getting to know Unity:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window (<em class="italic">1</em>): The tree view <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>of the current scene's GameObjects. Shows the same content as the scene in a hierarchical tree view of parent-child objects.<p>You may have noticed in the preceding screenshot that, while examining both the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> and <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> windows, the <strong class="bold">Safety Hat</strong> GameObject is currently selected and highlighted. A Unity <strong class="bold">GameObject</strong> is an object that is part of a scene. </p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view window (<em class="italic">2</em>): This shows <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>a 3D view of the current scene. Along the top of the scene window is an icon toolbar for controlling your working view of the scene. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window (<em class="italic">3</em>): The components <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>and properties of the selected GameObject. <p>GameObjects have <strong class="bold">components</strong> attached that define the runtime behavior of a GameObject. Unity includes <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>many built-in components, and you can write your own using the C# programming language. Each component may have individual <strong class="bold">properties</strong>; that is, settings that control the component.</p><p>You can see that the Safety Hat has <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> and <strong class="bold">Mesh Renderer</strong> components, for instance.</p><p>GameObjects always have one <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> component. GameObjects may also have a 3D mesh, renderer, and materials that determine how it's rendered in the scene. There are many other components you can add that extend an object's behavior, physics, and interactions.</p></li>
				<li><code>Assets/</code> folder, located under the project's root directory.<p><strong class="bold">Assets</strong> include files that <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>may be added to objects in a scene, such as images, audio, video, materials, and scripts. Scenes themselves are saved as assets. Complex predefined GameObjects <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>can also be saved as assets, called <strong class="bold">prefabs</strong>.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Console</strong> window (<em class="italic">4</em>, hidden behind Project tab): This shows error and information <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>messages from your application.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Game</strong> view window (<em class="italic">2</em>, hidden behind Scene tab): This shows the user's view, as rendered <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>by the in-scene camera GameObject.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Main Menu</strong>: At the <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>top of the <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> window is a menu where you can access many features of Unity. Adding additional packages to your project may add more menu items.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Main Toolbar</strong>: At the top of the <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> window and below the <strong class="bold">Main</strong> menu is an icon toolbar <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>organized into three sections. On the left-hand side, there are tools for editing the Scene view (including <strong class="bold">Move Tool</strong>, <strong class="bold">Rotate Tool</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Scale Tool</strong>). In the center, there are the play mode controls (including <strong class="bold">Play</strong> and <strong class="bold">Pause</strong>). Finally, on the right, there are additional controls, including some that allow you to access your Unity account and cloud services.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Take a <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>moment to explore the main menu items:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">File</strong> menu is for creating, saving, and loading scenes and accessing your build settings.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> menu is for selecting and editing objects in the project, accessing project-specific settings and preferences, and other editor-related tools. </li>
				<li>The <code>Assets/</code> folder). </li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">GameObject</strong> menu lets you add new objects to the current scene. </li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Component</strong> menu provides a categorized list of components that you can add to the currently selected GameObject in the scene. </li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Window</strong> menu is where you can find and open additional windows that provide more features. Importing new packages into Unity may add new menu bar items. <p class="callout-heading">Information – Using Play Mode in AR Projects</p><p class="callout">In most Unity projects, you can press the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button (in the main toolbar) to go into <em class="italic">play mode</em> and run <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>your scene in the Editor, running on your desktop rather than on the device. This is not so simple with an augmented reality scene since it requires an onboarding phase, where the software scans the environment for physical world features and then uses the physical device sensors for positional tracking. There are several solutions to facilitate your iterative developer workflow, all of which we will discuss in <a href="B15145_03_Final_SB_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor064"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a><em class="italic">, Improving the Developer Workflow</em>. </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can personalize <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>and rearrange the editor's window layout to suit your needs and preferences. Layouts can be saved and loaded using the <strong class="bold">Layout</strong> selection menu in the top-right corner of the editor. The screenshots in this book use layouts that are different from Unity's default layout.</p>
			<p>OK, enough talk – this is a hands-on book, so let's get hands-on right away and try out the Unity Editor. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Basics of using the Unity Editor</h2>
			<p>In this section, we'll build <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>a trivial scene with a 3D cube that gives us more context to explain how to use Unity:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new scene from the main menu by selecting <strong class="bold">File | New Scene</strong>.</li>
				<li>A <strong class="bold">New Scene</strong> window will appear (Unity 2020+ only) that lets you select a scene template. Choose the one named <strong class="bold">Basic (Built-in)</strong>. Then, press <strong class="bold">Create</strong>.<p>You will notice right away that the new scene contains two default GameObjects: a Main Camera and a Directional Light. </p></li>
				<li>Add a 3D cube to the scene by clicking <strong class="bold">GameObject | 3D Object | Cube</strong>. With that, the Cube will be added to the scene and be visible in both the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> and <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> windows. </li>
				<li>Ensure the Cube rests at the origin of our scene; that is, the <code>(0, 0, 0)</code> X-Y-Z coordinates. With <strong class="bold">Cube</strong> selected in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window, look in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window and set its <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> | <strong class="bold">Position</strong> | <strong class="bold">X</strong>, <strong class="bold">Y</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Z</strong> values to zero.</li>
				<li>Let's rotate the Cube. In the same <code>-20</code>.<p>The scene may now look as follows:</p></li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.5 – New scene with a 3D cube</p>
			<p>At this point, I encourage you to get familiar with the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view controls. Using a 3-button mouse <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>on Windows, for example, <em class="italic">right-click</em> in the window to pivot the view, <em class="italic">Alt + left-click</em> to orbit the view around the "center" of the view, and <em class="italic">center-click</em> the mouse to move the view. To move closer or further out (zoom), use <em class="italic">Alt + right-click</em> or use the scroll wheel. Note that the directional gizmo in the top right of the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> window indicates the current view showing the X, Y, and Z axes. For further information (including one- or two-button mice), see <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html</a>. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip – RGB == XYZ</p>
			<p class="callout">It's handy to remember that the red, green, and blue colors in gizmos correspond to the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively.</p>
			<p>We modified the Cube's transform by editing its numerical values in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window. You can also transform an object by directly manipulating it in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> window. For example, in the main toolbar, select <strong class="bold">Rotate Tool</strong>. With the Cube currently selected, you should now see the rotate gizmo rendered on the object in the scene. You can grab one of the gizmo handles (X, Y, or Z) and drag it to rotate the object around that axis, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.6 – Rotate tool selected</p>
			<p>For more <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>on transforming objects directly in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> window, see the Unity Manual (<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PositioningGameObjects.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PositioningGameObjects.html</a>).</p>
			<p>This was a very brief introduction to get you started. As a matter of habit, you should always save your work after accomplishing something. Let's save the scene, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">From the main menu, select <strong class="bold">File | Save As</strong>, which will open the <strong class="bold">Save Scene</strong> window.</li>
				<li>Navigate to the <code>Scenes/</code> subfolder (in your project's <code>Assets</code> folder).</li>
				<li>Give the scene a name, such as <code>My Cube</code>, and press <strong class="bold">Save</strong>.<p class="callout-heading">Tip – Confused or Overwhelmed? Take it a Step at a Time</p><p class="callout">As with any professional development and creative application, there's a huge assortment of things you can do with Unity, and it provides many tools to help you achieve your objectives. If you are confused or overwhelmed, a great strategy is to try and focus only on the menu items and windows you need right now and ignore the rest. We'll walk you through this with simple step-by-step instructions. As you gain experience and confidence, you'll expand your radius of familiarity and see how it all fits together. To be honest, I still learn new things about Unity each time I work on a project.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Of course, this was <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>just a brief introduction to Unity. If you need to find out more, please head over to <strong class="bold">Unity Learn</strong>, where there are some excellent beginner tutorials (using the <a href="https://unity.com/learn/get-started">https://unity.com/learn/get-started</a> link or the <strong class="bold">Learn</strong> tab in <strong class="bold">Unity Hub</strong>).</p>
			<p>Also, take a look at the <strong class="bold">Unity Manual</strong> introductory topics (<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityOverview.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityOverview.html</a>). </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Organizing your project assets</h2>
			<p>You have access to your project assets in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window. I like to keep the project assets that I create <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>in their own top-level folder, separate from other assets I might import from third-party sources such as the Unity Asset Store. </p>
			<p>Likewise, Unity's URP project template includes <strong class="bold">SampleScene</strong> and example assets. I suggest moving the URP example assets into their own folder to keep them separate from your own application assets. You can do this by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create an <code>Assets</code> folder named <code>URP-examples</code>. In the <code>URP-examples</code>.</li>
				<li>Drag each of the example folders into the <code>URP-examples</code> one, namely <code>ExampleAssets</code>, <code>Materials</code>, <code>Scenes</code>, <code>Scripts</code>, <code>TutorialInfo</code>, and the <code>Readme</code> file.</li>
				<li>Leave the <code>Presets</code> and <code>Settings</code> folders in the root <code>Assets/</code> folder.</li>
				<li>Create an <code>Assets</code> folder named <code>_App</code>. I like to prepend an underscore to this folder's name so that it remains at the top of the list.</li>
				<li>Create child folders inside <code>_App/</code> named <code>Materials</code>, <code>Prefabs</code>, <code>Scenes</code>, and <code>Scripts</code>. These subfolders will remain empty for now, but we'll add to them as we work through this book.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Organizing your assets by file type is a common convention in Unity, but you may have your own way <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>of doing things. Unity does not depend on these folder names or asset file locations. (That said, there are a few reserved folder names with special meanings to Unity; see <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpecialFolders.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpecialFolders.html</a>). Your <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window may now look as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.07-assets-folders.jpg" alt="Figure 1.7 – Reorganized Project Assets folders&#13;&#10;" width="642" height="325"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.7 – Reorganized Project Assets folders</p>
			<p>I think we're now ready to move on and continue setting up your system and installing the packages you need for AR development. We'll start by adding an AR device plugin to your project, and then do the same for the Foundation package.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Preparing your project for AR development</h1>
			<p>When you develop and build a project for augmented reality, Unity needs to know the device and <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>platform you are targeting. This is a multi-step process that includes adding the device plugin to your project and setting the target platform in <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong>. We'll address the device plugins now and <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong> later in this chapter.</p>
			<p>The following diagram shows the Unity XR technology architecture. As you can see, at the bottom of the stack are the various AR (and VR) provider plugins:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.08-xr-tech-stack.jpg" alt="Figure 1.8 – The Unity XR tech stack &#13;&#10;" width="1371" height="966"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.8 – The Unity XR tech stack </p>
			<p>At the bottom of the stack is <strong class="bold">XR Plugins</strong>, separate provider packages that implement a software interface to a specific device. Plugins allow Unity to talk with a device by connecting the Unity XR subsystems with an operating system and runtime API. Ordinarily, you will not be using a plugin directly but a higher-level toolkit instead, such as AR Foundation (which we will install in the next section). Some plugins are provided and maintained by Unity Technologies; others are vendor-supported third-party plugins. </p>
			<p>In the preceding diagram, at the top of the plugins are <strong class="bold">XR Subsystems</strong>, which form <strong class="bold">XR Plugin Framework</strong>. This abstracts sets of features into separate APIs. When an application is running, it can query the capabilities of the current runtime device and enable or <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>disable sets of features in the app accordingly. Atop <strong class="bold">XR Subsystems</strong> is the <strong class="bold">AR Foundation</strong> toolkit (and <strong class="bold">XR Interaction Toolkit</strong>), which provides the main AR API for your Unity applications. We will be using AR Foundation extensively for the projects in this book.</p>
			<p>Now, let's install the XR plugin(s) you need for this project.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Installing XR plugins for AR devices</h2>
			<p>To prepare <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>our project for AR development, we'll install the <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>AR device plugin for your target device via the <strong class="bold">XR Plug-in Management</strong> window. With your project open in Unity, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> window by selecting <strong class="bold">Edit | Project Settings </strong>from the main menu.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> menu on the left, select <strong class="bold">XR Plugin Management</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Install XR Plugin Management</strong> button. It may take a moment for Unity to import and compile the package scripts.</li>
				<li>If necessary, click the <strong class="bold">XR Plug-in Management</strong> item again to show <strong class="bold">Plug-in Providers</strong> and other options. Notice that there are tabs for each of the target platforms. Select the one you will be targeting first. <p>For example, in the <strong class="bold">XR Plug-in Management</strong> window, the <strong class="bold">Android</strong> tab will be only available if you installed the <strong class="bold">Android Build Support</strong> module when you installed Unity via Unity Hub. </p></li>
				<li>Check the checkbox for the AR plugin you want to use. For example, for Android, select <strong class="bold">ARCore</strong>, while for iOS, select <strong class="bold">ARKit</strong>. <p class="callout-heading">Tip – Don't Mix VR and AR Plugins in the Same Project</p><p class="callout">You'll see that the <strong class="bold">XR Plug-in Management</strong> window lets you choose any combination of AR and VR plugins. In our projects, we're only interested in the AR ones. Generally, do not include both AR and VR plugins in the same project as the build settings, player settings, camera rigs, and many other things can differ significantly between AR and VR projects. (Perhaps when you read this, there will be devices that support both modes in a single app, but I am not aware of any at this time.)</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the following screenshot of the <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> window, I have selected the <strong class="bold">XR Plug-in Management Settings</strong> menu. In my window, there are three tabs for each of the <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>possible target platforms for this project that I have<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> installed: Desktop, iOS, and Android (yours may be different). With the <strong class="bold">Android</strong> tab selected, you can see that I have checked the <strong class="bold">ARCore</strong> plugin. You'll also notice that, on the left-hand side, there's an additional <strong class="bold">ARCore</strong> menu item that you can click to see options that are specific to that plugin:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.09-xr-plugin-mgt-arcore.jpg" alt="Figure 1.9 – XR Plug-in Management window with the ARCore plugin selected&#13;&#10;" width="972" height="492"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.9 – XR Plug-in Management window with the ARCore plugin selected</p>
			<p>Interestingly, <strong class="bold">XR Plug-in Manager</strong> is a shortcut to installing the corresponding packages in <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong>. You can verify this by opening <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong> and reviewing the installed packages by <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>performing the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open Package Manager from the main menu and choose <strong class="bold">Window | Package Manager</strong>.</li>
				<li>Ensure the filter selection at the top left of the <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong> window says <strong class="bold">Packages In Project</strong>.</li>
				<li>You should see your plugin in the list; for example, <strong class="bold">ARCore XR Plugin</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For example, in the following screenshot of <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong>, which shows <strong class="bold">Packages In Project</strong> (top left of the window), <strong class="bold">ARCore XR Plugin</strong> has been installed <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>and selected. You can see that this specific version of the plugin has been <strong class="bold">Verified</strong> for the Unity version being used by this project. It also shows a description of the plugin's features, links to its documentation, and other details. Also, I have unfolded the plugin's <strong class="bold">Other Versions</strong> list to show you how to review each of the plugin's versions; this is where you might upgrade (or downgrade) a plugin to a different version:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.10-package-manager-arcore.jpg" alt="Figure 1.10 – Package Manager with the ARCore XR plugin installed in this project&#13;&#10;" width="729" height="385"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.10 – Package Manager with the ARCore XR plugin installed in this project</p>
			<p>At this point, you could begin developing an augmented reality project, if you wanted to write code directly using the XR subsystem's developer-facing C# interface. However, it's more <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>likely that you will install a higher-level toolkit <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>that is more Unity developer-friendly. Still, you may need to drop down into the plugin framework to access the XR subsystems directly. For example, you may wish to scan and start a particular subsystem, as shown in the example at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/xrsdk-runtime-discovery.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/xrsdk-runtime-discovery.html</a>. Later in this book, we may need to access the plugin framework's SDK. For the most part, we will be using the higher-level <strong class="bold">AR Foundation</strong> toolkit. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Installing the AR Foundation package</h2>
			<p>AR Foundation is a package that provides a development layer between your application and the <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>underlying device features and plugins. AR Foundation provides components and other assets that help you build AR projects once, then deploy for multiple mobile and wearable AR devices. Using a "unified workflow," as Unity says, your app can support current and future features that may or may not be currently available on your end user's specific device at runtime. This helps "future-proof" your AR apps. In this section, we'll install and explore AR Foundation.</p>
			<p>The features that are supported by AR Foundation will depend on the current capabilities of the target devices and varies between versions of AR Foundation. The following chart shows the feature support per platform that AR Foundation offers:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.11-arf-supported-features-table-4-1-5.jpg" alt="Figure 1.11 – AR Foundation 4.1.5 features per platform&#13;&#10;" width="704" height="432"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.11 – AR Foundation 4.1.5 features per platform</p>
			<p>See the <strong class="bold">Platform Support</strong> section of the AR Foundation documentation page (<a href="mailto:https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@latest/index.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@latest/index.html</a>) for the most up to date details for the version you are using.</p>
			<p>Unity provides a <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong>, which <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>enables you to expand <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>Unity's core functionality by installing additional packages in your project. This way, you can choose just the features you need for a particular project. The XR plugins we installed in the previous <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>section are packages. Now, we'll use the Package Manager to install the <strong class="bold">AR Foundation</strong> package. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Information – Advantages of Unity Packages</p>
			<p class="callout">With Unity packages come many advantages. Unity can update the core Editor independently of other features. Likewise, packages can be updated outside of Unity's core release cycle. Decoupling their dependencies reduces the risk of schedule delays and technical problems, allowing for more agile development cycles and support for technology advances inside and outside the Unity offices. For example, if Apple releases an update to ARKit, then Unity can release an update to its ARKit plugin without having to wait for the next release of the Unity Editor, nor depending on the Unity core development team. If you've ever worked on a large project with multiple teams, you can appreciate the benefits of this architecture. Teams can be organized so that they focus on the details that their package provides, and then test for successful integration with the Unity core product.</p>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>install AR Foundation using Package Manager by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the Package Manager from the main menu by going to <strong class="bold">Window | Package Manager</strong>.</li>
				<li>Set the package filter in the top left to <strong class="bold">Unity Registry</strong> to see a list of all the official packages.</li>
				<li>In the search box, type <code>ar</code>. You should now see all the AR-related packages in the list.</li>
				<li>It is important to pay attention to the version numbers of the package, and whether that particular version has been verified with the Unity version you're using in your project.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">AR Foundation</strong>, and then press <strong class="bold">Install</strong>. It may take a moment to install.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once installed, you may discover that new items have been added to the main menu bar, including options under <strong class="bold">GameObject | XR</strong>. Don't select any just yet – we'll get to that in the next chapter, <a href="B15145_02_Final_SS_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Your First AR Scene</em>, where we will use the toolkit to create our first AR scene with AR Foundation.</p>
			<p>You also need to choose an input handler for your project. We'll look at this in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Choosing an input handler</h2>
			<p>The Unity product is continually improving. One relatively recent advancement is the introduction of the new <strong class="bold">Input System</strong>, which is replacing the classic <strong class="bold">Input Manager</strong>. At the <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>time of writing, Unity projects can be configured to use either one, or both in the same project. The input handler you choose can have a significant impact on your development because their usages are quite different. The classic Input Manager mostly uses <em class="italic">polling</em>, while the new Input System uses <em class="italic">events</em> (see <a href="https://blog.unity.com/technology/introducing-the-new-input-system">https://blog.unity.com/technology/introducing-the-new-input-system</a>). This is a generalization as both software patterns can be implemented using either handler, but the new Input System is better designed and more flexible. In the interest of advancing the state of the art, the projects in this book will use the new Input System. </p>
			<p>However, some example scenes that you will be importing into your project, including the <em class="italic">AR Foundation Samples</em> in <a href="B15145_02_Final_SS_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Your First AR Scene</em>, will use the classic Input Manager, so it's prudent to allow your project to support both.</p>
			<p>To configure your project to use the new Input System, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">To import the Input System package, open the Packager Manager by going to <strong class="bold">Window | Package Manager</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Unity Registry</strong> from the filter selection in the top left of the window.</li>
				<li>Find <code>input</code>), and click <strong class="bold">Install</strong>.</li>
				<li>You may be prompted to let Unity automatically change your Player Settings to use the new Input System. You can say "no" to this. We'll do this manually.</li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">Player Settings</strong> window by going to <strong class="bold">Edit | Project Settings | Player</strong>.</li>
				<li>Locate <strong class="bold">Configuration | Active Input Handling</strong> and select <strong class="bold">Both</strong> (or if you prefer, select <strong class="bold">Input System Package (New)</strong>). </li>
			</ol>
			<p>We will begin working with input in <a href="B15145_02_Final_SS_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Your First AR Scene</em>, as well as the subsequent chapters.</p>
			<p>You also need to set up the project's render pipeline for AR support. Let's learn how to do this.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Adding support for the Universal Render Pipeline</h2>
			<p>Because we <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>created this project using the <strong class="bold">Universal Render Pipeline</strong> (<strong class="bold">URP</strong>), there's one <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>additional thing you need to do – add AR video background support to the graphics forward renderer (see <a href="mailto:https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.1/manual/ar-camera-background-with-scriptable-render-pipeline.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.1/manual/ar-camera-background-with-scriptable-render-pipeline.html</a>). This feature renders the device's video feed immediately on the screen before the virtual graphics are rendered on top of those pixels. Perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <code>Assets/Settings/</code> folder.</li>
				<li>Select the asset named <strong class="bold">ForwardRenderer</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window, click the <strong class="bold">Add Renderer Feature</strong> button and select <strong class="bold">AR Background Renderer Feature</strong>. The resulting Forward Renderer settings are shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.12-url-renderer.jpg" alt="Figure 1.12 – ForwardRenderer data asset with the AR Background Renderer Feature added&#13;&#10;" width="614" height="404"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.12 – ForwardRenderer data asset with the AR Background Renderer Feature added</p>
			<p>Furthermore, as a reminder, if you import any assets into your project, you may need to convert <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>their materials for the render pipeline. We will do this for the sample assets at the end of this chapter. </p>
			<p>You have now installed Unity using Unity Hub, created and opened a new Unity project, installed XR plugins for your AR device, installed the AR Foundation package, selected an input handler for your project, and configured the render pipeline for AR. The next step is <a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>to continue setting up your project for the target platform. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Setting up for mobile development</h1>
			<p>Depending on the <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>device platform you are targeting with your project, you will need to install additional software and development tools, as well as configure your Unity project with platform-specific settings.</p>
			<p>If you are developing for <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>Android ARCore, go to the <em class="italic">Setting up for Android/ARCore Development</em> section. If you are developing for Apple ARKit, go to the <em class="italic">Setting Up for iOS/ARKit Development</em> section. Finally, if you are developing for wearable AR d<a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>evices, go to the <em class="italic">Developing for wearable AR glasses</em> section.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Setting up for Android/ARCore development</h2>
			<p>If you want to build and run your project on an Android device, there are a few extra steps in setting up your project for <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>Android development and ARCore. I'll <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>summarize the process here but naturally, things can change, and I recommend that you look at the documentation for the most current instructions, including Google's ARCore docs, in addition to the Unity Manual.

If it is not already selected, please click the <strong class="bold">Change Platform</strong> button. If it is disabled, go back to <em class="italic">Step 1</em>.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">XR Plugin</em>: Ensure the <strong class="bold">ARCore</strong> plugin is currently installed and selected. Select <strong class="bold">Edit | Project Settings</strong>, and then select <strong class="bold">XR Plug-in Management</strong> from the side menu (initializing it if necessary). Click the <strong class="bold">Android</strong> icon to see the list of Android plugins and check the <strong class="bold">ARCore</strong> checkbox if it is not already checked.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">USB Debugging</em>: The next step is to enable USB debugging on your Android device (phone or tablet). Open the device's <strong class="bold">Settings &gt; About</strong> window and find the <strong class="bold">Build Number</strong> item. (Depending on the brand, you may need to drill down another level or find the <strong class="bold">Build Number</strong> item in a slightly different location.) The next thing you must do I think is very funny – perform a magical incantation by clicking the <strong class="bold">Build Number</strong> item seven times! Then, magically, a <strong class="bold">Developer Options</strong> menu option will appear. Select that and enable <strong class="bold">USB Debugging</strong>. <p>You can now connect your device to your development machine, and it should be recognized as an attached peripheral device. </p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The next thing to consider is the <strong class="bold">Android Player</strong> settings in your project. A review of these options can be found here: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsAndroid.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsAndroid.html</a>. Specific settings are required for AR projects targeting ARCore. Please double-check the current requirements, as can be found in the <em class="italic">Configure Project Settings</em> topic on the <em class="italic">Quickstart ARCore</em> page (<a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity-arf/quickstart-android">https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity-arf/quickstart-android</a>). Continuing from the previous steps, I suggest doing the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><em class="italic">Player Settings</em>: In Unity, navigate to <strong class="bold">Edit | Project Settings | Player</strong> to open the <strong class="bold">Player Settings</strong> window. It contains many options, including tabs at the top to switch between platform-specific settings. Generally, you can keep the default settings<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> unless otherwise <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>advised, or when you're optimizing your project builds. Initialize the following settings:</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Other Settings | Rendering</strong>: Uncheck <strong class="bold">Auto Graphics API</strong>. If Vulkan is listed under Graphics APIs, remove it as Vulkan is not yet supported by ARCore. To do so, select <strong class="bold">Vulcan</strong> and press the <strong class="bold">-</strong> (minus) icon in the lower right. Also, uncheck <strong class="bold">Multithreaded Rendering</strong> as it's (currently) not compatible with ARCore. </li>
				<li><code>com.DefaultCompany.MyARProject</code>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Other Settings | Minimum API Level</strong>: If you are building an <strong class="bold">AR Required</strong> app, specify <strong class="bold">Android 7.0 'Nougat' (API Level 24)</strong> or higher. If you are building an <strong class="bold">AR Optional</strong> app, specify Android <strong class="bold">API Level 14</strong> or higher.<p class="callout-heading">Information – The Word "player" in Unity</p><p class="callout">The word "<em class="italic">player</em>" in Unity carries multiple meanings. The user of your application or game may be referred to as the <em class="italic">player</em>. In a game, the first-person GameObject (containing a camera controlled by the user) might also be referred to as the <em class="italic">player</em>. In a non-AR video game, the game controller might be called the <em class="italic">player controller</em>. However, in <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong>, the <em class="italic">player</em> refers to the result of the build process; it is an executable program that is installed on your target device (along with other asset files and data) that "<em class="italic">plays</em>" your application. In this case, the word is akin to a <em class="italic">media player</em>, for example, that plays a music or video file. <strong class="bold">Player Settings</strong> in Unity configures how Unity is built and deployed to your target device.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Meanwhile, you also have the option to<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> install additional capabilities<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> provided by the <strong class="bold">ARCore Extensions</strong> package for Unity. This package extends AR Foundation to some more advanced features of ARCore that are currently not supported in AR Foundation. To install <strong class="bold">ARCore Extensions</strong>, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Download the latest <code>arcore-unity-extensions-*.tgz</code> tarball from the GitHub releases page at <a href="https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-extensions/releases/">https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-extensions/releases/</a>.</li>
				<li>Open the Package Manager using <strong class="bold">Window | Package Manager</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the top left of the window, click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon and choose <strong class="bold">Add package from tarball</strong>, as shown here:<div><img src="img/Figure_1.13-add-package-from-tarball.jpg" alt="Figure 1.13 – Adding a tarball package&#13;&#10;" width="460" height="198"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.13 – Adding a tarball package</p></li>
				<li>Locate the downloaded <code>arcore-unity-extensions-*.tgz</code> tarball.</li>
				<li>Then, click <strong class="bold">Open</strong>. It may take a few moments to install the package and any dependencies.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Your project is now set up to <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>target Android ARCore with AR Foundation. We'll verify <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>your settings in the next chapter, <a href="B15145_02_Final_SS_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Your First AR Scene</em>, when we create an AR scene, build it, and run it on your device. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Setting up for iOS/ARKit development</h2>
			<p>If you want to build and <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>run your project on an Apple iOS<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> device, there are a few extra steps in setting up your project for iOS development and ARKit. I'll summarize the process here, but naturally, things can change, and I recommend that you look at the necessary documentation for the most current instructions. </p>
			<p>Developing for iOS requires a Mac computer running OSX. Then, you need to install the XCode development environment. It is also strongly recommended that you join the Apple Developer Program, which currently costs $99 (USD) per year for individuals. You can do some limited Unity development for iOS without becoming an Apple Developer but it's not practical, especially for AR, where you need to test your app on a physical device. </p>
			<p>Here is a list of some relevant links:</p>

This does not lend itself to a rapid development cycle! If you're in this situation, my recommendation is to buy a used Android phone that supports ARCore. Then, develop your app using AR Foundation on your Windows PC targeting Android first, and then periodically run iOS/ARKit builds to test and verify it runs on that device. Unity Cloud Builds requires a Unity Plus or Pro license or a Unity Teams Advanced subscription.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Developing for iOS and ARKit requires <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>performing the following steps. You may have<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> completed some of these steps already:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><em class="italic">Apple Developer Program</em>: This is your admission ticket for developing for iOS. Go to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">https://developer.apple.com/programs/</a> to learn more and enroll.  </li>
				<li><em class="italic">Xcode</em>: Download and install the current copy of Xcode, the development environment required to develop any Apple products.

				<li><em class="italic">Build support modules</em>: In <strong class="bold">Unity Hub</strong>, ensure you have installed the <strong class="bold">iOS</strong> platform build support modules for the specific version of Unity you are using with your project. </li>
				<li><em class="italic">Target Platform</em>: In the Unity Editor, open the <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong> window by selecting <strong class="bold">File | Build Settings</strong>. Within the <strong class="bold">Platforms</strong> panel, select the <strong class="bold">iOS</strong> platform from the list. If it is not already selected, please click the <strong class="bold">Change Platform</strong> button. If <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>it is disabled, go back to <em class="italic">Step 1</em>.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">XR Plugin</em>: Ensure the <strong class="bold">ARKit</strong> plugin is currently installed and selected. Select <strong class="bold">Edit | Project Settings</strong>, and <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>then select <strong class="bold">XR Plug-in Management</strong> from the side menu (initialize it if necessary).

				<li><em class="italic">Player Settings</em>: In the <code>Required for augmented reality support</code>), setting <code>11</code>, and <strong class="bold">Architecture | ARM64</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When Unity builds an iOS project, it does not actually build the app. Instead, it constructs an XCode project folder that is then opened in XCode, which, in turn, is used to build the app. One of the critical services XCode provides is ensuring you are authorized for development by provisioning your app, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Installing a <strong class="bold">Development Provisioning Profile</strong> for each device where you plan to test your app. Follow the instructions at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityCloudBuildiOS.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityCloudBuildiOS.html</a>, under the <em class="italic">Create a Certificate</em> topic. </li>
				<li>Adding your <strong class="bold">Apple ID</strong> account to Xcode by going to <strong class="bold">Preferences | Accounts</strong>. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>For more information on using Xcode and Unity, see the <em class="italic">Unity Manual: Structure of a Unity Xcode Project</em> (<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StructureOfXcodeProject.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StructureOfXcodeProject.html</a>) and other related pages. </p>
			<p>This process can be<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> confusing. Everyone who develops<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> for iOS goes through a similar process, so you're certainly not alone, and there's a lot of answers to be found on the internet. Remember: "DuckDuckGo is your friend." And fortunately, you usually only need to do this once.</p>
			<p>Note that you can also set your <strong class="bold">Signing Team ID</strong> in your Unity Player settings by navigating to <strong class="bold">Edit | Project Settings | Player | Identification</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Information – Apple's Own AR Development Tools</p>
			<p class="callout">Upon reviewing the Apple web pages, you will discover that they provide their own AR development tools (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/">https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/</a>) apart from Unity. Of course, I'm a big fan of Unity and AR Foundation, which give you device independence and all the other powerful features of Unity, but it's good to be aware of alternatives.</p>
			<p>Your project has now been set up to target Apple ARKit with AR Foundation. We'll verify your settings in the next chapter, <a href="B15145_02_Final_SS_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Your First AR Scene</em>, when we create an AR scene, build it, and run it on your device. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Developing for wearable AR glasses</h2>
			<p>AR Foundation supports not just handheld mobile AR devices using ARCore and ARKit, but also wearable AR glasses, including Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap. Likewise, targeting wearable AR devices may require configuring Unity to target a platform other than Android or iOS. Wearable AR glasses remain relatively expensive and outside the reach of the typical consumer as they're aimed at<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> corporate or industrial applications. While this book can serve as a lovely starting point for developing these devices, and the projects can be adapted accordingly, it is outside the scope of this book to support wearable AR devices in the subsequent chapters.</p>
			<p>For <strong class="bold">Microsoft HoloLens</strong>, you must set up Unity to target <strong class="bold">Universal Windows Platform (UWP)</strong>, beginning with installing the required module via Unity Hub, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.14-hub-modules-uwp.jpg" alt="Figure 1.14 – Adding UWP build support for HoloLens&#13;&#10;" width="544" height="253"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.14 – Adding UWP build support for HoloLens</p>
			<p>To set up for HoloLens development, you will need to use <strong class="bold">Visual Studio IDE</strong> and a compatible version of <strong class="bold">Windows 10 SDK</strong>. For additional information, here are some useful links:</p>

			<p>For the <strong class="bold">Magic Leap</strong> wearable <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>AR products, you must set up Unity to target <strong class="bold">Lumen OS</strong>, beginning with installing the required module via Unity Hub, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>

			</ul>
			<p>Interestingly, Magic<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> Leap provides a <strong class="bold">Unity Template</strong> that you can add to Unity Hub as a starting point for new projects (<a href="https://github.com/magicleap/UnityTemplate">https://github.com/magicleap/UnityTemplate</a>). </p>
			<p>Now that you have a project set up for AR development on your target platform and device, let's build a test to make sure things are working so far.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Building and running a test scene</h1>
			<p>Before moving on and building an AR project, it is prudent to verify your project has been set up <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>properly so far by trying to build and run it on your target <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>device. For this, we'll create a minimal AR scene and verify that it satisfies the following checklist:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can build the project for your target platform.</li>
				<li>The app launches on your target device.</li>
				<li>When the app starts, you see a video feed from its camera on the screen.</li>
				<li>The app scans the room and renders depth points on your screen.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I'll walk you through this step by step. Don't worry if you don't understand everything; we will go through this in more detail together in <a href="B15145_02_Final_SS_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Your First AR Scene</em>. Please do the following in your current project, which should be open in Unity:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>scene named <em class="italic">BasicTest</em> by selecting <code>Scenes</code> folder, call it <code>BasicTest</code>, and click <strong class="bold">Save</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window, delete the default <strong class="bold">Main Camera</strong> (<em class="italic">right-click</em> and select <strong class="bold">Delete</strong>, or use the <em class="italic">Del</em> keyboard key).</li>
				<li>Add an AR Session object by selecting <strong class="bold">GameObject | XR | AR Session</strong>.</li>
				<li>Add an AR Session Origin object by selecting <strong class="bold">GameObject | XR | AR Session Origin</strong>.</li>
				<li>Add a point cloud manager to the Session Origin object by clicking <code>ar point</code> in the search field and select <strong class="bold">AR Point Cloud Manager</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You will notice that the Point Cloud Manager has an empty slot for a Point Cloud Prefab, which is used for visualizing the detected<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> depth points. A <strong class="bold">prefab</strong> is a GameObject saved as a project asset that can be added to the scene (<em class="italic">instantiated</em>) at runtime. We'll create a prefab using a very simple Particle System. Again, if this is new to you, don't worry about it – just follow along:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a Particle System by selecting <strong class="bold">GameObject | Effects | Particle System</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the <code>PointParticle</code>.</li>
				<li>On the <strong class="bold">Particle System</strong> component, uncheck the <strong class="bold">Looping</strong> checkbox.</li>
				<li>Set its <code>0.1</code>.</li>
				<li>Uncheck <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>the <strong class="bold">Play on Awake</strong> checkbox.</li>
				<li>Click <code>ar point</code> in the <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>search field, and select <strong class="bold">AR Point Cloud</strong>.</li>
				<li>Likewise, click <strong class="bold">Add Component</strong> and select <strong class="bold">AR Point Cloud Visualizer</strong>.</li>
				<li>Drag the <strong class="bold">PointParticle</strong> object from the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window to the <strong class="bold">Prefabs</strong> folder in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window (create the folder first if necessary). This makes the GameObject into a<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> prefab.</li>
				<li>Delete <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>the <strong class="bold">PointParticle</strong> object from the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window using <em class="italic">right-click</em> <strong class="bold">| Delete</strong> or press the <em class="italic">Del</em> key.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The Inspector window of the <strong class="bold">PointParticle</strong> object should now look as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.16-pointparticle.jpg" alt="Figure 1.16 – Inspector view of our PointParticle prefab with the settings we're using highlighted&#13;&#10;" width="633" height="912"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.16 – Inspector view of our PointParticle prefab with the settings we're using highlighted</p>
			<p>We can now apply the PointParticle prefab to the AR Point Cloud Manager, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window, select the <strong class="bold">AR Session Origin</strong> object.</li>
				<li>From the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window, drag the <strong class="bold">PointParticle</strong> prefab into the <strong class="bold">AR Point Cloud Manager |</strong> <strong class="bold">Point Cloud Prefab</strong> slot. (Alternatively, click the "doughnut" icon to the <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>right of the slot to open the <strong class="bold">Select GameObject</strong> window, select the <strong class="bold">Assets</strong> tab, and choose <strong class="bold">PointParticle</strong>). </li>
				<li>Save the <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>scene using <strong class="bold">File | Save</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The resulting AR Session Origin should look as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.17-pointcloudmanager.jpg" alt="Figure 1.17 – Session Origin with a Point Cloud Manager component populated with the PointParticle prefab" width="631" height="354"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.17 – Session Origin with a Point Cloud Manager component populated with the PointParticle prefab</p>
			<p>Now, we are ready to build and run the scene. Perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong> window using <strong class="bold">File | Build Settings</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Add Open Scenes</strong> button to add this scene to the build list.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Scenes in Build</strong> list, uncheck all scenes except the <strong class="bold">BasicTest</strong> one.</li>
				<li>Ensure your device is connected to your computer via USB cable.</li>
				<li>Press the <code>Builds/</code>. Give it a filename (if required) and press <strong class="bold">Save</strong>. It may take a while to complete this task.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If all goes well, the project <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>will build, install on your device, and launch. You should <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>see a camera video feed on your device's screen. Move the phone slowly in different directions. As it scans the environment, feature points will be detected and rendered on the screen. The following screen capture shows my office door with a point cloud rendered on my phone. As you scan, the particles in the environment that are closer to the camera appear larger than the ones further away, contributing to the user's perception of depth in the scene. </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.18-officedoor.jpg" alt="Figure 1.18 – Point cloud rendered on my phone using the BasicTest scene&#13;&#10;" width="710" height="1262"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.18 – Point cloud rendered on my phone using the BasicTest scene</p>
			<p>If you encounter <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>errors while building the project, look at the <strong class="bold">Console</strong> window in the <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>Unity Editor for messages (in the default layout, it's a tab behind the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window). Read the messages carefully, generally starting from the top. If that doesn't help, then review each of the steps detailed in this chapter. If the fix is still not apparent, do an internet search for the message's text, as you can be certain you're probably not the first person to have a similar question!</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip – Build Early and Build Often</p>
			<p class="callout">It is important to get builds working as soon as possible in a project. If not now, then certainly do so before the end of the next chapter, as it does not make a lot of sense to be developing an AR application without having the confidence to build, run, and test it on a physical device.</p>
			<p>With a successful <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>build, you're now <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>ready to build your own AR projects. Congratulations!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, after a quick introduction to augmented reality, you immediately got started on your road to developing your own AR projects. You installed Unity via Unity Hub and learned the importance of tracking the different versions of Unity, as well as its projects and packages. You got a brief tour of using the Unity Editor, including some key concepts that are fundamental to 3D and AR. </p>
			<p>You then set up your project and system software for AR development, including installing an XR plugin, the AR Foundation package, tools for Android or Xcode, and other items necessary to get things set up. Lastly, we created a minimal AR scene (including a quick point cloud prefab using a particle system component) and built the scene to verify it builds and runs on your target device.</p>
			<p>Setting up your machine may be intricate and painful, but it's your entry ticket to Unity development, and everyone has to do it. If you got through this chapter with everything running, you are a hero! </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we'll begin to take a closer look at AR development using Unity and AR Foundation by creating a new AR scene, step by step, explaining each component as we go.</p>
