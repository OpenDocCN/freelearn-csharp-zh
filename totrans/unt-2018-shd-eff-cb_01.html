<p class="calibre3">It's great to write your own shaders and effects so that you can fine-tune your project to look just the way that you want, and this is what we will be spending the majority of the book looking into. However, it's also good to point out that Unity already comes with some prebuilt ways to get some of the more common effects that users like to have through the use of the Post Processing Stack.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For those who just want to get something up and running, the Post Processing Stack can be an excellent way for you to tweak the appearance of your game without having to write any additional code. Using the Post Processing Stack can also be useful in showing you just what shaders can do and how they can improve your game projects as, behind the scenes, the Post Processing Stack is itself a shader that is applied to the screen, aptly called a screen shader.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Before we can use the Post Processing Stack, we must first get it from the newly introduced <span class="calibre6">Package Manager</span>. A Unity package is a single file that contains various assets that can be used in Unity in a similar manner to a <kbd class="calibre13">.zip</kbd> file. Previously, Unity used the <span class="calibre6">Asset Store</span> to share these files with users, but as time has gone on, the <span class="calibre6">Package Manager</span> has been added to give users an easy way to get free content from Unity. We will actually be using the <span class="calibre6">Package Manager</span> again in <a href="part0258.html#7M1H40-e8c76c858d514bc3b1668fda96f8fa08" class="calibre10">Chapter 12</a>, <em class="calibre14">Shader Graph</em>, but right now we will be using it for the <span class="calibre6">Post-Processing</span> package that it contains.</p>

<p class="calibre3">To get started with this recipe, you will need to have Unity running and have created a new project. This chapter also requires you to have an environment to work from. The code files provided with this book will contain a basic scene and content to create the scene Unity's Standard Assets.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Open the <kbd class="calibre13">Chapter 1  </kbd>| <kbd class="calibre13">Starting Point</kbd> scene inside of the <kbd class="calibre13">Asset</kbd> | <kbd class="calibre13">Chapter 01</kbd> | <kbd class="calibre13">Scenes</kbd> folder from the <span class="calibre6">Project</span> browser. If all goes well, you should see something like this from the <span class="calibre6">Game</span> tab:</p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" class="calibre20"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">This is a simple environment that will allow us to easily see how changes made in post-processing effects can modify how things are drawn on the screen.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">If you are interested in learning how to create the environment used, check out my previous book, <em class="calibre21">Unity 5.x Game Development Blueprints</em>, also available from Packt Publishing.</div>

<p class="calibre3">To begin:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li value="1" class="calibre12">Open up the <span><span>Package</span> Manager</span> by going to <span>Window</span> | <span>Package Manager</span> (or by pressing <em class="calibre2">Ctrl + 9</em>):</li>

<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" class="calibre22"/></div>
<ol start="2" class="calibre15">
<li value="2" class="calibre12">From the list view, click on the <span>All</span> button to display a list of all of the possible packages that are there. Once the list populates with all of the choices, select the <span>Post-processing</span> option:</li>

<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00007.jpeg" class="calibre23"/></div>
<ol start="3" class="calibre15">
<li value="3" class="calibre12">From there, at the top right of the menu, click on the <span>Install 2.0.7-preview</span> button. You may need to wait for a while for it to complete downloading the content. Once it's completed, you should be brought back to the <span>In</span> <span>Project</span> selection and now you'll see <span>Post-processing</span> added to the list:</li>
</ol>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" class="calibre24"/></div>
<ol start="4" class="calibre15">
<li value="4" class="calibre12">Close out of the <span>Packages</span> tab and go back to the <span>Scene</span> window to see the level. Then, from the <span>Hierarchy</span> window, we want to select the object that has our <span>Camera</span> component attached to it, as the Post Processing Stack needs to know which screen we want to modify. If you are using your own project, you may select the <span>MainCamera</span> object that comes with the default Unity scene, but the example project that is being used has the <span>Camera</span> located as a child of the <kbd class="calibre13">FPSController</kbd> object. To select it, click on the arrow next to the name to extend the object's children and then select the <kbd class="calibre13">FirstPersonCharacter</kbd> object:</li>
</ol>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00009.jpeg" class="calibre25"/></div>
<p class="calibre26">This object has the <span class="calibre6">Camera</span> component on it, which is in charge of drawing what it sees to the <span class="calibre6">Game</span> tab when the game starts.</p>
<div class="packt_tip"><span class="calibre27">You can double-click on a game object in the </span><span class="calibre27">Hierarchy</span><span class="calibre27"> tab to zoom the camera from the <span class="calibre27">Scene</span> tab to its location. This makes it very easy to find things, even in a large game level.</span></div>
<ol start="5" class="calibre15">
<li value="5" class="calibre12">With the object selected and our <span>Camera</span> component attached to it, <span>next </span>we need to add the <span>Post-processing Behavior</span> component to the object by going into <span>Component</span> | <span><span>Rendering</span></span> | <span>Post-process Layer</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00010.jpeg" class="calibre25"/></div>
<ol start="6" class="calibre15">
<li value="6" class="calibre12">Once added, from the <span>Inspector</span> tab, scroll down to the <span>Post Process Layer</span> <span>(Script)</span> component and, under <span>Layer</span>, change the dropdown to <kbd class="calibre13">PostProcessing</kbd>.</li>
<li value="7" class="calibre12">  This tells the component which objects we want to draw on the screen. When setting this, an object must have its <span>Layer</span> property set to <kbd class="calibre13">PostProcessing</kbd> in order to be seen. </li>
</ol>
<ol start="8" class="calibre15">
<li value="8" class="calibre12">To create a <span>Post Process Volume</span>, go to the menu and select<span> </span><span>GameObject </span>| <span>3D Object</span> | <span>Post Process Volume</span>.

Finally, to make it easier to work with, change the<span> </span><span>Position</span><span> </span>to<span> </span><kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd><span> </span>and under the<span> </span><span>Post Process Volume</span><span> </span>component, check the<span> </span><span>Is Global</span><span> </span>property:</li>
</ol>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00011.jpeg" class="calibre25"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Notice that there is a<span class="calibre6"> </span><span class="calibre6">Profile</span><span class="calibre6"> </span>property to the volume. This property will contain information about how we wish to modify the screen. By checking <span class="calibre6">Is Global</span>, we are saying that this information should always be drawn on an object. By unchecking it, the effects will only be visible from a certain distance from where the volume is placed. Depending on the game, this could allow you to drastically modify how the game appears in certain areas, but we care only about getting the visual effect at this point.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Now that we have the Post Processing Stack installed, we can create our first <span class="calibre6">Post-processing Volume</span>. The new Post Processing Stack relies on using volumes that describe how things should be drawn, either globally or within a certain area.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One of the most common appearances people like projects to have is that of a film. This is used quite frequently in titles such as the <em class="calibre14">Uncharted</em> series and <em class="calibre14">Grand Theft Auto V</em>. It's also used quite effectively in the <em class="calibre14">Left 4 Dead</em> series, as its creator are trying to emulate the B-movie zombie films that the games are based on.</p>

<ol class="calibre15">
<li value="1" class="calibre12">We first create a new <span>Post Processing Profile</span> by right-clicking within the <kbd class="calibre13">Assets </kbd>| <kbd class="calibre13">Chapter 1</kbd> folder in the <span>Project</span> window and then selecting <span>Create</span> | <span>Post Processing Profile</span>. Once selected, it will allow us to rename the item. Go ahead and set the name to <kbd class="calibre13">FilmicProfile</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00012.jpeg" class="calibre25"/></div>
<div class="packt_tip">If you happen to not enter the name correctly, you can rename an item from the <span class="calibre27">Project</span> tab by clicking on the name and then clicking again.</div>
<ol start="2" class="calibre15">
<li value="2" class="calibre12">Once created, you should notice that, when selected, the <span>Inspector</span> window will now contain a button that says <span>Add effect...</span> (as you can see in the preceding image), which will allow us to augment what is normally drawn on the screen.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre12">From the <span>Hierarchy</span> tab, select the <span>Post-process Volume </span>object again and from the <span>Inspector</span> tab go to the <span>Post Process Volume</span> component and assign the <span>Profile</span> property to the <kbd class="calibre13">FilmicProflie</kbd> we just created:</li>

<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00013.jpeg" class="calibre25"/></div>
<p class="calibre26">Notice that, once the <span class="calibre6">Profile</span> has been set, the <span class="calibre6">Add effect...</span> button shows up here as well. We can use this at either place and the changes will be saved in the file.</p>
<ol start="4" class="calibre15">
<li value="4" class="calibre12">To get started, click on the <span>Add effect...</span> button and select the <span>Unity</span> | <span>Grain</span> option. By default, you'll only see the <span>Grain</span> option with a check, so click on the arrow to expand its contents:</li>
</ol>
<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00014.jpeg" class="calibre25"/></div>
<p class="calibre26">By default, you'll see that everything is greyed out. In order to have it affect anything, you have to click on the checkbox on the left-hand side. You can quickly turn them all on or off by pressing the <span class="calibre6">All</span> or <span class="calibre6">None</span> buttons on the screen.</p>
<ol start="5" class="calibre15">
<li value="5" class="calibre12">In our case, check the <span>Intensity</span> option and set it to <kbd class="calibre13">0.2</kbd>.

<div class="packt_tip">Unlike how users typically work in Unity, due to Post Processing Profiles being filed, you can modify them while playing your game and, upon stopping the game, the values are still saved.

<li value="7" class="calibre12">The next property we want to tweak is the <span>Vignette</span> property. Note the blackened edges around the screen.

<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre28"/></div>
<ol start="8" class="calibre15">
<li value="8" class="calibre12">Next, select <span>Add effect...</span> again and, this time, select <span>Unity</span> | <span>Depth of Field</span>. Check the <span>Depth of Field</span> option. It may be difficult to see a change right off the bat, but change the <span>Focus Distance</span> to <kbd class="calibre13">6</kbd> and <span>Focal Length</span> to <kbd class="calibre13">80</kbd> and you should notice the grass in front of the background and the mountain in the distance are now blurred:</li>

<div class="cdpaligncenter"><img src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre29"/></div>
<ol start="9" class="calibre15">

<p class="calibre3">Each time we add an effect to a <span class="calibre6">Post-processing Volume</span>, we are overriding what would normally be put onto the screen.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you've been to a movie theater that still uses<span class="calibre6"> film, you may have noticed how there were </span><span class="calibre6">little specks in the filmstock while the film was playing. The <strong class="calibre5">grain</strong> effect simulates </span><span class="calibre6">this film grain, causing the effect to become more pronounced the more the movie is </span><span class="calibre6">played. This is often used in horror games to obscure the player's vision.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For more information on the grain effect, check out: <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki/Grain" class="calibre31">https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki/Grain</a>.</div>
<p class="calibre3">In the film world, <strong class="calibre5">vignetting</strong> can be<span class="calibre6"> an unintended effect of using the wrong type of lens for the type of shot you are trying to achieve or </span><span class="calibre6">the aspect ratio that you are shooting for</span><span class="calibre6">. In game development, we typically use vignetting for dramatic effect or to have players focus on the center of the screen by darkening and/or desaturating the edges of the screen compared to the center.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span class="calibre27">For more information on the vignette effect, check out: <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki/Vignette" class="calibre31">https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki/Vignette</a>.</span></div>
<p class="calibre3">The <strong class="calibre5">depth of field</strong> setting basically determines what is blurry and what isn't. The idea is to have items of importance in focus while items in the background are not.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For more information on the depth of field effect, check out: <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki/Depth-of-Field" class="calibre31">https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki/Depth-of-Field</a>.</div>

<p class="calibre3">The <strong class="calibre5">bloom</strong> optical effect aims to mimic the imaging effects of real-world cameras, where things in areas with lights will glow along the edges, thus overwhelming the camera. The bloom effect is very distinctive and you've likely seen it employed in areas in a game that are magical or heaven-like.</p>

<p class="calibre3">As<span class="calibre6"> </span>mentioned<span class="calibre6"> </span>before, bloom will make bright things even brighter while adding a glow to lighter areas. In this recipe, you may notice that the path is much lighter than it was previously. This can be used in order to ensure that players will follow the path to get to the next section of gameplay.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For more information on bloom, check out: <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki/Bloom" class="calibre31">https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki/Bloom</a>.</div>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre6">Anti-aliasing</span><span class="calibre6"> </span>attempts to reduce the appearance of aliasing, which is the effect of lines appearing jagged on the screen. This <span class="calibre6">is </span>typically due to the fact that the display the player is using to play the game doesn't have a high enough resolution to be displayed properly. <span class="calibre6"><span class="calibre6">Anti-aliasing</span></span> will combine colors with nearby lines in order to remove their prominence, at the cost of the game appearing blurry.</p>

<p class="calibre3">One of the best ways to easily change the mood of a scene is by changing the colors a scene uses. One of the best examples of this is in the <em class="calibre14">Matrix</em> series of films, where the real world is always blue-tinted, while the computer-generated world of the Matrix is always tinted green. We can emulate this in our games through the use of color grading.</p>

<p class="calibre3">One of the types of games that best utilize the features of the Post Processing Stack is the horror genre. Using things such as depth of field to hide scary objects, as well as static to make the screen more menacing, can really help set your game firmly in the right place and provide the mood you are going for.</p>
