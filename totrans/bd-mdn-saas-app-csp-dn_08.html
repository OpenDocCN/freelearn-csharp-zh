			<h1 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>Authentication and Authorization</h1>
			<p>Authentication and authorization are fundamental concepts in software development and have particular importance in the context of <strong class="bold">software-as-a-service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) applications. In a SaaS context, all of the users’ data is typically stored remotely and is only as secure as the authentication and authorization mechanisms. These mechanisms help to ensure that users can interact with the application in a secure and controlled manner and that sensitive data and resources are protected from unauthorized access.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will explore the key concepts and best practices for implementing authentication and authorization, with a focus on doing so in a SaaS application. Of course, we will focus on the Microsoft stack, but the principles that we cover should be applicable to most modern options for web development. We will begin by discussing the differences between authentication and authorization and how these mechanisms work together to provide a secure environment for users and their data.</p>
			<p>We will then move on to explore some of the technical considerations for implementing authentication and authorization in a SaaS application and will consider some of the specific challenges that are faced by developers of such applications. In particular, we’ll consider how multi-tenancy (as discussed in <a href="B19343_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>) and microservice architecture (as discussed in <a href="B19343_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor140"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>) impact the security landscape.</p>
			<p>Throughout an application’s life cycle, users will come and go, and at times they will change their roles within the application. We’ll take a look at how to manage the changing and hopefully growing user base.</p>
			<p>Finally, we’ll work on a practical example, where we will add authentication and authorization to our demo application, using the skills we have covered in this chapter to build a robust model for security that could be scaled up for use in a real-world application.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts and best practices for implementing authentication and authorization in a SaaS application. You will also have a deeper appreciation for the importance of getting these mechanisms right and how doing so can help to protect valuable data and resources, as well as build trust and confidence among users!</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/>What are authentication and authorization</h1>
			<p>Before diving into the implementation details, let’s take a moment to understand the fundamental concepts of authentication and authorization using a real-world analogy. Imagine that your application is like a secured building, and the various resources or actions within the application are represented by rooms inside the building. To ensure the security of the building and its contents, access to the rooms is controlled by a two-step process: authentication and authorization.</p>
			<p>Authentication<a id="_idIndexMarker554"/> is the process of verifying the identity of a person or entity attempting to access the building, much like presenting an ID card to the security guard at the entrance. In the context of an application, authentication involves confirming that a user is who they claim to be, typically through the use of a username and password. This is the first step in ensuring the security of your application.</p>
			<p>Once a user’s identity has been authenticated and they have been allowed to enter the building, the next step is to determine what they are allowed to do within the building. This is where authorization <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>comes into play. Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or actions based on the authenticated user’s permissions, just like an access card or key you receive after your identity is verified. These permissions are usually assigned through roles or claims and can be as simple or complex as your application requires.</p>
			<p>This idea of a secured building with ID required to get into the building, and then once in, keycard access for certain parts of the building, is a very useful analogy for authentication and authorization that you should keep in mind as we dive a little deeper into these concepts!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/>Authentication</h2>
			<p>We’ll start <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>by delving deeper into the various aspects of authentication, exploring different forms and methods, their implementation in .NET, and best practices. By understanding the nuances of authentication and how to properly implement it, you can build a robust foundation for protecting your application and its users as the rest of the application takes shape.</p>
			<p>While most often, we think of a username and password for authentication, there are a few ways to approach this. Alternatives<a id="_idIndexMarker557"/> to username and password include token-based authentication, <strong class="bold">multi-factor authentication</strong> (<strong class="bold">MFA</strong>), and <strong class="bold">single sign-on</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSO</strong>). We<a id="_idIndexMarker558"/> will take a look at how to implement these authentication methods, with a focus on how this works in .NET-based applications.</p>
			<p>We will also cover some other important topics, such as securely storing passwords and secrets, as well as best practices for enforcing strong password policies and implementing account lockout policies.</p>
			<h3>Forms of authentication</h3>
			<p>In the world of application <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>security, there are several forms of authentication to verify the identity of someone wishing to use the application. Each method has its own advantages and limitations.</p>
			<p>The most common form of authentication is a simple username and password system, with which we are all familiar! This method relies on users keeping their passwords confidential and choosing strong, complex passwords to reduce the risk of unauthorized access, which can be a fairly significant flaw in a security system!</p>
			<p>Using MFA can help to mitigate this. MFA requires users to provide two or more forms of authentication to verify their identity, which can greatly improve a system’s overall security.</p>
			<p>In an enterprise setting, it is common for the organization to use SSO. This allows users to access multiple related applications or services using a single set of credentials. The big advantage of this is that the organization has a lot of control over the security setup. For example, they are able to insist on passwords of a certain complexity or enforce MFA.</p>
			<h3>Implementing authentication in .NET</h3>
			<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker560"/> subsection, we will explore how to implement various authentication methods in .NET using ASP.NET Core Identity and integrating with external authentication providers. We will discuss the configuration and customization of these methods to align with your application’s requirements.</p>
			<p>Later in this chapter, we will use these techniques to add authentication to our demo application.</p>
			<h4>ASP.NET Core Identity</h4>
			<p>ASP.NET Core Identity<a id="_idIndexMarker561"/> is a flexible <a id="_idIndexMarker562"/>and extensible framework that provides a secure way to manage user authentication and authorization. It includes features such as password hashing, two-factor authentication, and support for external authentication providers. To get started with ASP.NET Core Identity, you’ll need to install the necessary NuGet packages and configure your application by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Install the required NuGet packages with the following command:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore</strong>
<strong class="bold">dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UI</strong></pre></li>
				<li>Update your application’s <code>DbContext</code> to inherit from <code>IdentityDbContext</code>, which includes the necessary <code>Identity</code> tables for storing user information.</li>
				<li>Register the <code>Identity</code> services in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method of your <code>Startup</code> class by adding <code>services.AddIdentity</code> and <code>services.AddAuthentication</code>.</li>
				<li>Configure middleware for <code>Identity</code> and authentication by adding <code>app.UseAuthentication</code> and <code>app.UseAuthorization</code> in the <code>Configure</code> method of your <code>Startup</code> class.</li>
				<li>Modify <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>your views and <a id="_idIndexMarker564"/>controllers to include the necessary authentication functionality, such as login, registration, and logout actions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You will see the preceding steps in action when we add authentication to the demo application later in this chapter.</p>
			<h4>Integrating with external authentication providers</h4>
			<p>To enhance the user <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>experience and security of your application, you may want to integrate with external authentication providers, such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, and social logins, such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, or Twitter.</p>
			<p>OAuth 2.0 is an <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>authorization framework that enables your application to obtain limited access to user accounts on an external service, while <strong class="bold">OpenID Connect</strong> (<strong class="bold">OIDC</strong>) is an authentication<a id="_idIndexMarker567"/> layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 that provides a secure way to authenticate users and obtain their basic profile information.</p>
			<p>To implement OAuth 2.0 and OIDC in your .NET application, you can use the <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect</code> package. This package includes middleware to handle the OIDC authentication flow, such as obtaining an authorization code, exchanging it for an access token, and validating the token.</p>
			<p>Doing so is outside the scope of the demo application, but it may be a useful exercise to try and add this yourself!</p>
			<p>ASP.NET Core Identity also supports integration with popular social login providers such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter. To implement social logins in your application, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Register your application with the desired social login provider to obtain a client ID and client secret.</li>
				<li>Install the corresponding NuGet package for the social login provider, such as <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google</code>, <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Facebook</code>, or <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter</code>.</li>
				<li>Configure the social login provider in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method of your <code>Startup</code> class by adding <code>services.AddAuthentication().Add[ProviderName]</code> and pass the client ID and client secret obtained earlier.</li>
				<li>Update your login view to include buttons or links for each social login provider.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Every user of <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/>your application will be different and will have different preferences for logging into your application. By implementing various authentication methods in .NET and integrating with external providers, you can create a secure and user-friendly authentication experience for your SaaS application.</p>
			<h3>Securely storing passwords and secrets</h3>
			<p>Protecting <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>sensitive information such as user passwords and application secrets is crucial to maintaining the security and integrity of your SaaS application. In this section, we will discuss techniques for securely storing passwords and secrets in your .NET application.</p>
			<h4>Password hashing and salting</h4>
			<p>When storing<a id="_idIndexMarker570"/> a user’s password in a database, or anywhere for that matter, storing that password in ‘plaintext’ is always a huge mistake that will compromise your application security. Instead, passwords should be hashed and salted before being stored in the database.</p>
			<p>Plaintext refers to storing the password as the user enters it. So if the password is ‘Passw0rd1’, then that string is the plaintext representation of that password. Hashing is a one-way function that transforms the password into a fixed-length string of characters, while salting involves adding a random value (which is known as ‘the salt’) to the password before hashing to prevent attacks using precomputed tables.</p>
			<p>ASP.NET Core Identity automatically handles password hashing and salting using the <code>IdentityOptions.Password</code> settings in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method of your <code>Startup</code> class.</p>
			<p>Leveraging the<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> built-in identity tools in .NET offers significant advantages. Developing custom identity providers can be both challenging and error-prone. Utilizing well-established and battle-tested solutions is always the preferred approach!</p>
			<h4>Securely managing API keys and other secrets</h4>
			<p>In addition <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>to users’ passwords, your application may also rely on sensitive information such as API keys, connection strings, or encryption keys. Again, storing these secrets in plaintext or hardcoding them in your source code is a <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>mistake that can expose your application to security risks and should be avoided at all costs!</p>
			<p>In much the same way that the built-in .NET Core Identity services should be used, pre-existing and battle-tested tools and technologies should be used to manage the application secrets. Here are some best practices that should be your go-to approach!</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>IConfiguration</code> interface in your application. This is a great way to keep development secrets separate from the secrets of the production environment.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Environment variables</strong>: Storing <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>secrets in environment variables helps to keep them separate from your application code and allows for easy configuration changes. In production environments, consider using a centralized configuration management solution to manage environment variables and secrets securely.</li>
				<li><code>Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureKeyVault</code> package and configure it in your <code>Startup</code> class.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By securely<a id="_idIndexMarker578"/> storing passwords and application secrets, you<a id="_idIndexMarker579"/> help protect your application and its data from unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Adopting these best practices will ensure that sensitive information remains confidential and secure in your .NET-based SaaS application.</p>
			<h3>Authentication best practices</h3>
			<p>Implementing<a id="_idIndexMarker580"/> a secure and effective authentication process is crucial for the overall security of your SaaS application. By following best practices, you can enhance the user experience, improve security, and minimize the risk of unauthorized access.</p>
			<h4>Enforcing strong password policies</h4>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>protect against weak or easily guessed passwords, enforce strong password policies in your application. ASP.NET Core Identity allows you to configure password requirements, such as minimum length, complexity, and character types. Consider the following guidelines for strong password policies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Require a minimum length of at least 12 characters; more is better. Passwords that are too short can easily fall to brute force attacks.</li>
				<li>Enforce the use of a mix of character types, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Increasing the number of characters to choose from makes the passwords harder to guess.</li>
				<li>Disallow easily guessable passwords or common patterns, such as “password123” or “qwerty.”</li>
				<li>Do not require regular password changes. It used to be considered good practice to require users to frequently change their passwords, but this is no longer the case as frequent changes can lead to weaker passwords, as users struggle to remember their ever-changing passwords.</li>
				<li>Encourage <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>MFA. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification methods beyond the password, such as a one-time code, a hardware token, or biometric data.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Monitoring and auditing authentication events</h4>
			<p>Monitoring and auditing authentication events <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>can help you identify suspicious activity, detect unauthorized access attempts, and maintain a secure environment for your SaaS application. ASP.NET Core Identity provides built-in support for logging authentication events, which should always be used over writing your own implementation.</p>
			<p>Consider implementing the following monitoring and auditing practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Log all authentication events, including successful logins, failed login attempts, password changes, and account lockouts.</li>
				<li>Regularly review authentication logs to identify unusual patterns, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address or unusual login times. This process could be automated.</li>
				<li>Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for critical authentication events, such as repeated failed login attempts or unauthorized access to sensitive resources.</li>
				<li>Ensure that logs are stored securely and retained for a sufficient period to support incident response and forensic analysis.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Implementing account lockout policies</h4>
			<p>Account lockout <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>policies can help protect against brute-force attacks, where an attacker repeatedly attempts to guess a user’s password. ASP.NET Core Identity supports account lockout functionality, allowing you to lock out a user’s account after a specified number of failed login attempts.</p>
			<p>Consider the following guidelines when implementing account lockout policies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Set a reasonable threshold for the number of failed login attempts before locking an account, such as 3–5 attempts.</li>
				<li>Determine an appropriate lockout duration, balancing security concerns with user experience. This could range from a few minutes to several hours, depending on your application’s requirements.</li>
				<li>Implement a mechanism for users to unlock their accounts, such as by contacting support, resetting their password, or using a secondary authentication factor.</li>
				<li>Monitor account lockout events to identify potential brute-force attacks or other security threats.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is often the case with the development that the team can, to a certain extent, pick and choose which best practices they want to strictly adhere to. This is fine for the most part but is decidedly not so when it comes to authentication. Commonly understood best practices should always be followed, and out-of-the-box implementations are always preferred over in-house tools. By keeping the preceding best practices in mind from the start of the development process, we can be sure that our SaaS application is as secure as possible!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/>Authorization</h2>
			<p>We have<a id="_idIndexMarker585"/> covered authentication in detail; now, it is time to move on to authorization. Authorization involves determining what actions and resources an authenticated user is allowed to access within your application.</p>
			<p>We will begin by discussing the core concepts of authorization, such as <strong class="bold">role-based access control</strong> (<strong class="bold">RBAC</strong>), <strong class="bold">claims-based access control</strong> (<strong class="bold">CBAC</strong>), and <strong class="bold">attribute-based access control</strong> (<strong class="bold">ABAC</strong>). Next, we will look into the implementation of authorization in .NET using ASP.NET Core Authorization Policies, Role, and Claims Management <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>with ASP.NET Core Identity and Custom Authorization Middleware and Filters.</p>
			<p>Finally, we will discuss best practices for authorization, including<a id="_idIndexMarker587"/> the <strong class="bold">principle of least privilege </strong>(<strong class="bold">POLP</strong>), <strong class="bold">separation of duties</strong> (<strong class="bold">SoD</strong>), and<a id="_idIndexMarker588"/> regular auditing and monitoring of access controls.</p>
			<h3>Understanding authorization concepts</h3>
			<p>Let’s start by looking at the core concepts of authorization, which involve determining the actions and resources a user is allowed to access within an application. By understanding these concepts, you can create a secure and efficient access control system for your SaaS application.</p>
			<h4>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h4>
			<p>RBAC is <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>an approach to authorization<a id="_idIndexMarker590"/> that assigns users to specific roles, which in turn grants them permission to perform certain actions or access specific resources. RBAC simplifies the management of access control by allowing you to define and manage permissions at the role level rather than assigning permissions directly to individual users.</p>
			<p>Examples of roles in a SaaS application might include “administrator,” “manager,” and “user,” each with different levels of access to application resources and functionality.</p>
			<p>RBAC is typically used when managing permissions for groups of users with similar responsibilities, making it easier to grant and revoke access to resources based on predefined roles.</p>
			<h4>Claims-Based Access Control (CBAC)</h4>
			<p>CBAC is <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>an <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>alternative approach to authorization that focuses on claims, which are pieces of information about a user, such as their name, role, or other attributes. In CBAC, permissions are granted based on the user’s claims rather than their role.</p>
			<p>This approach<a id="_idIndexMarker593"/> allows for more fine-grained access control and can provide a more flexible and dynamic authorization system compared to RBAC. Claims can be issued by your application or external authentication providers, such as social logins or enterprise identity <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/>systems<a id="_idIndexMarker595"/> such as <strong class="bold">Azure Active Directory</strong> (<strong class="bold">Azure AD</strong>).</p>
			<p>Claims-based access control is preferred when you need more fine-grained and dynamic control over user access.</p>
			<h4>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</h4>
			<p>ABAC is<a id="_idIndexMarker596"/> a more advanced approach to <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>authorization that evaluates a set of attributes associated with a user, resource, action, and environment to determine whether access should be granted. ABAC enables context-aware access control decisions based on a rich set of attributes and can support complex access control policies.</p>
			<p>In an ABAC system, rules or policies are defined using a <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>policy language, such as <strong class="bold">eXtensible Access Control Markup Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">XACML</strong>). These rules are then evaluated by a <strong class="bold">policy decision point</strong> (<strong class="bold">PDP</strong>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>determine whether access should be granted or denied.</p>
			<p>ABAC is preferred when you require a highly granular and context-aware authorization system that considers multiple attributes, such as user characteristics, resource attributes, and environmental factors, to make access control decisions.</p>
			<h3>Implementing authorization in .NET</h3>
			<p>Later, we <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>will build authorization into our demo app. First, we will discuss how to implement various authorization concepts in .NET using ASP.NET Core Authorization Policies, Role and Claims Management with ASP.NET Core Identity, and Custom Authorization Middleware and Filters.</p>
			<h4>ASP.NET Core Authorization Policies</h4>
			<p>ASP.NET Core provides <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>a powerful and flexible authorization framework that allows you to define and enforce access control policies based on roles, claims, or custom logic. To implement authorization policies in your .NET application, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Define authorization policies in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method of your <code>Startup</code> class by adding <code>services.AddAuthorization</code> and configuring policy options using the <code>AddPolicy</code> method. You can specify requirements based on roles, claims, or custom rules.</li>
				<li>Apply authorization policies to your controllers or action methods using the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute with the specified policy name. This attribute ensures that only users who meet the policy requirements can access the protected resources.</li>
				<li>If needed, create custom authorization handlers and requirements to implement complex authorization logic or integrate with external systems. Register your custom handlers in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method of your Startup class.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Role and claims management with ASP.NET Core Identity</h4>
			<p>ASP.NET Core Identity <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>provides built-in support for managing roles and claims, making it easy to implement RBAC and CBAC in your application. To use roles and claims with ASP.NET Core Identity, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Enable role management in your application by updating <code>DbContext</code> to inherit from <code>IdentityDbContext</code> with a role type such as <code>IdentityRole</code>.</li>
				<li>Add role management services to the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method of your <code>Startup</code> class by calling <code>services.AddIdentity</code> with the <code>AddRoles</code> method.</li>
				<li>Use the <code>RoleManager</code> and <code>UserManager</code> classes in your application to create, update, and delete roles, assign roles to users, and manage claims associated with users.</li>
				<li>Protect <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>your application resources using the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute with roles or policy-based authorization, as discussed in the previous section.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Custom authorization middleware and filters</h4>
			<p>In<a id="_idIndexMarker604"/> some cases, you may need to implement custom authorization logic that goes beyond roles, claims, and policies. ASP.NET Core allows you to create custom middleware and filters to perform additional authorization checks or enforce access control at a global level.</p>
			<p>To create custom middleware, define a new class that implements the <code>IMiddleware</code> interface and perform your authorization checks in the <code>InvokeAsync</code> method. Register your custom middleware in the <code>Configure</code> method of your <code>Startup</code> class by calling <code>app.UseMiddleware</code>.</p>
			<p>To create a custom authorization filter, define a new class that implements the <code>IAuthorizationFilter</code> or <code>IAsyncAuthorizationFilter</code> interface, and perform your authorization checks in the <code>OnAuthorization</code> or <code>OnAuthorizationAsync</code> method. Register your custom filter globally in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method of your <code>Startup</code> class by adding it to the <code>services.AddControllers</code> or <code>services.AddMvc</code> options.</p>
			<h3>Integrating with external authorization services</h3>
			<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>some scenarios, you may wish to integrate your .NET application with external authorization services, such as Azure AD, Azure AD B2C, or OAuth 2.0 resource servers, to manage access control for your users. In this subsection, we will discuss how to integrate your application with these services.</p>
			<h4>Azure AD and Azure AD B2C</h4>
			<p>Azure AD is a<a id="_idIndexMarker606"/> cloud-based <strong class="bold">identity and access management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAM</strong>) service<a id="_idIndexMarker607"/> provided by Microsoft. Azure AD allows you to centralize the management of users, groups, and access control for your application. Azure AD B2C is a related<a id="_idIndexMarker608"/> service that provides consumer-focused identity management, allowing<a id="_idIndexMarker609"/> you to implement SSO and MFA for your application users.</p>
			<p>To integrate your .NET application with Azure AD or Azure AD B2C, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Register your application in the Azure portal, and configure your application to use Azure AD or Azure AD B2C for authentication and authorization.</li>
				<li>In your .NET application, add the <code>Microsoft.Identity.Web</code> package and configure the authentication services in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method of your <code>Startup</code> class by calling <code>services.AddAuthentication</code> and <code>services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp</code>.</li>
				<li>Protect your application resources using the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute with roles, policies, or custom authorization logic, as discussed in the previous sections.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>OAuth 2.0 scopes and resource servers</h4>
			<p>OAuth 2.0 is <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>an <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>industry-standard protocol for authorization, which allows you to grant third-party applications access to your resources on behalf of a user without sharing their credentials. In the context of OAuth 2.0, your .NET application may act as a resource server, which hosts protected resources and requires valid access tokens for authorization.</p>
			<p>To integrate your .NET application with an OAuth 2.0 authorization server, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Register your application with the authorization server, and configure it to use OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization.</li>
				<li>In your .NET application, add the appropriate OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect middleware package, such as <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth</code> or <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect</code>, and configure the authentication services in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method of your <code>Startup</code> class.</li>
				<li>Define and<a id="_idIndexMarker612"/> enforce access control policies based on OAuth 2.0 scopes or claims by implementing custom authorization logic, as discussed in the previous sections.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>By integrating your .NET application with external authorization services, you can take advantage of centralized IAM, SSO, MFA, and other advanced security features to protect your application resources and provide a seamless user experience.</p>
			<h3>Authorization best practices</h3>
			<p>To ensure a<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> secure and efficient access control system for your SaaS application, it is essential to follow authorization best practices. In this subsection, we will discuss some of the most important best practices to keep in mind while implementing authorization in your application.</p>
			<h4>Principle of least privilege</h4>
			<p>The POLP is<a id="_idIndexMarker614"/> a fundamental security concept that dictates that users should be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. By adhering to this principle, you can minimize the potential damage caused by unauthorized access or compromised user accounts. To implement POLP, ensure that you do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Assign users to the least privileged roles or create custom roles with the minimum required permissions.</li>
				<li>Regularly review and update user permissions to ensure that they align with their current responsibilities.</li>
				<li>Implement fine-grained access controls using claims or attributes when necessary to further restrict access to sensitive resources.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Separation of duties</h4>
			<p>SoD is <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>another important security concept that involves dividing critical tasks and responsibilities among multiple users or roles to prevent any single user from having excessive access or control. To implement SoD in your application, ensure that you perform the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Define distinct roles for different tasks and responsibilities, and assign users to these roles based on their job functions.</li>
				<li>Implement checks and balances, such as requiring multiple approvals for critical actions or using different roles for data entry and data validation.</li>
				<li>Regularly audit and monitor user activity to ensure that SoD is maintained and identify any potential violations or conflicts.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Regular auditing and monitoring of access controls</h4>
			<p>Continuously <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>monitoring and auditing your access control system can help you identify potential security risks, ensure that user permissions are up-to-date, and detect unauthorized access or abuse. To implement regular auditing and monitoring of access controls, consider the following practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Maintain detailed logs of all authorization events, such as role or permission changes, access attempts, and policy evaluations.</li>
				<li>Regularly review these logs to identify unusual patterns or potential security risks, such as users with excessive permissions, unauthorized access attempts, or policy violations.</li>
				<li>Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for critical authorization events or anomalies and promptly investigate and address any identified issues.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By following these authorization best practices, you can create a secure and efficient access control system for your SaaS application, protecting your valuable resources and data while ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor206"/>The synergy of authentication and authorization</h2>
			<p>In a robust and secure SaaS application, authentication and authorization work hand in hand to protect your resources and data. While authentication verifies the identity of a user, confirming they are who they claim to be, authorization determines what actions and resources the authenticated user is allowed to access. By effectively combining these two concepts, you can create a strong and comprehensive access control system for your application.</p>
			<p>Integrating<a id="_idIndexMarker617"/> authentication and authorization effectively in your .NET application involves using technologies such as ASP.NET Core Identity, OAuth 2.0, and Azure AD. These technologies provide a seamless experience for your users while ensuring proper access control. By following best practices for both authentication and authorization, you can minimize potential security risks and maintain the integrity of your SaaS application.</p>
			<p>A well-implemented access control system that synergistically combines authentication and authorization not only provides a secure environment for your SaaS application but also helps create a seamless and efficient user experience, contributing to the overall success of your application.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/>Criticality of secure authentication and authorization</h2>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker618"/> rapidly evolving world of SaaS application development, it’s crucial to prioritize security and privacy from the very beginning. By investing time and resources in getting authentication and authorization right upfront, you’re not only protecting your application and users but also building a strong foundation for future growth and adaptability.</p>
			<p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>key reasons to emphasize proper authentication and authorization is the potential impact of security breaches. Data leaks, unauthorized access, and cyberattacks can have severe consequences for both businesses and end-users. The financial costs associated with data breaches, damage to brand reputation, and loss of customer trust can be devastating. By implementing robust security measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of such incidents and the associated liabilities.</p>
			<p>Another important factor is compliance with data protection and privacy regulations, such as the <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDPR</strong>) in Europe and the <strong class="bold">California Consumer Privacy Act </strong>(<strong class="bold">CCPA</strong>) in the USA. These regulations require businesses to implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and privacy. Neglecting to do so can lead to hefty fines and legal ramifications. Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are essential to demonstrate your commitment to data protection and to comply with these regulations.</p>
			<p>However, implementing <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>effective authentication and authorization <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>can be challenging, particularly in complex SaaS environments that may involve multi-tenancy, microservices, and distributed systems. As you scale your application, you’ll need to ensure that security measures continue to provide a high level of protection and adapt to changing requirements.</p>
			<p>Some of the challenges include managing user identities and access control across various services, securely storing and transmitting sensitive data, and maintaining isolation between tenants. Additionally, you’ll need to stay up-to-date with the latest security best practices and emerging threats to ensure your application remains secure in the face of new vulnerabilities and attack vectors.</p>
			<p>Investing in robust authentication and authorization upfront is essential for the security, privacy, and success of your SaaS application. By doing so, you’ll protect your users, comply with regulations, and build a solid foundation for future growth. While it can be a challenging endeavor, taking the time to get it right will pay dividends in the long run, ensuring the ongoing safety and trust of your customers!</p>
			<p>Authentication and authorization are large and complex topics, even on a simple application. With SaaS, we are playing on hard mode, though – we also need to think about how to secure a multi-tenant and microservice application. We will consider these nuances in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>Multi-tenancy and microservices</h1>
			<p>In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker622"/> will explore the unique challenges and considerations associated with implementing authentication and authorization in multi-tenant and microservices-based SaaS applications. Multi-tenancy requires special attention to ensure proper tenant identification and isolation, as well as managing tenant-specific roles and permissions. On the other hand, microservices architecture presents its own set of challenges, such as centralized authentication, API gateway access control, and secure service-to-service communication.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>Multi-tenancy considerations</h2>
			<p>There are a few specific considerations that we have to think about as developers of multi-tenant applications.</p>
			<h3>Tenant identification and isolation</h3>
			<p>In a <a id="_idIndexMarker623"/>multi-tenant SaaS application, correctly identifying and isolating tenants is a critical aspect of ensuring data security and privacy. Tenant identification is the process of determining which tenant a user belongs to when they interact with your application. Tenant isolation ensures that data and resources are securely separated between tenants, preventing unauthorized access or data leaks.</p>
			<p>As you will remember from <a href="B19343_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, there are several approaches to tenant identification, including using subdomains, URL paths, or custom headers. The chosen method should be consistent and easy to manage. Whichever approach you select, it’s important to validate tenant identifiers in every request to ensure that users can only access data and resources belonging to their tenant.</p>
			<p>Tenant isolation can be achieved at different levels, such as the database, application, or infrastructure level. For example, you could use separate databases or schemas for each tenant, ensuring data is physically separated. Alternatively, you could use a shared database with row-level security, which enforces tenant isolation at the data access layer. At the application level, you can implement tenant-aware middleware or filters that enforce tenant isolation in every request.</p>
			<p>When designing your multi-tenant SaaS application, consider the trade-offs between these approaches in terms of complexity, scalability, and maintainability. By effectively implementing tenant identification and isolation, you can build a secure and compliant SaaS application that safeguards tenant data and resources.</p>
			<h3>Tenant-specific roles and permissions</h3>
			<p>SaaS <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>applications are frequently multi-tenant, so it is essential to understand how to manage tenant-specific roles and permissions to ensure that users have the appropriate level of access to resources and functionality within their tenant. This not only helps maintain data security but also provides a tailored user experience for each tenant, as different tenants may require different sets of roles and permissions.</p>
			<p>One approach to managing tenant-specific roles and permissions is to extend the existing role and permission model by including a tenant identifier. This way, when you assign roles and permissions to users, you can associate them with a specific tenant. This ensures that users can only perform actions and access resources within their tenant’s context.</p>
			<p>When implementing tenant-specific roles and permissions, consider the following best practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Define a clear and flexible role hierarchy that can accommodate the needs of different tenants. This may include common roles shared across all tenants, as well as custom roles specific to certain tenants.</li>
				<li>Assign roles and permissions based on the POLP, ensuring users have only the necessary access to perform their tasks.</li>
				<li>Implement a user-friendly interface for tenant administrators to manage roles and permissions within their tenants. This allows tenants to have more control over their users’ access levels and simplifies the administration process.</li>
				<li>Regularly review and update tenant-specific roles and permissions to ensure they accurately reflect each tenant’s requirements and the application’s functionality.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Tenant onboarding and offboarding</h3>
			<p>As well as<a id="_idIndexMarker625"/> users coming and going, tenants will also join the application and (sadly) leave. Tenant onboarding and offboarding are important processes in managing multi-tenant SaaS applications. Properly managing these processes helps ensure a smooth and efficient experience for your tenants while maintaining security and compliance.</p>
			<p>Onboarding<a id="_idIndexMarker626"/> a new tenant starts with tenant registration, where you gather essential information about the new tenant, such as their organization name, contact information, and any custom configuration options they might require. Next, set up the necessary resources for the tenant, such as databases, schemas, or namespaces, and apply any tenant-specific configurations. After the initial setup, create user accounts, including tenant administrators, and assign appropriate roles and permissions.</p>
			<p>In addition to the basic setup, consider applying any tenant-specific branding, integrations, or customizations required for the tenant’s unique needs. Finally, provide documentation, tutorials, or other support materials to help the tenant’s users get started with your application.</p>
			<p>When offboarding a tenant, it’s essential to follow a well-defined process to ensure clean and secure decommissioning. Start by providing the tenant with the ability to export their data in a standard format, ensuring they retain access to their information. Once the tenant’s data has been exported, proceed to resource cleanup by removing the tenant’s resources, such as databases, schemas, or namespaces, and any associated data.</p>
			<p>Also, deactivate user accounts and revoke any access tokens or API keys related to the tenant. This step helps prevent unauthorized access to your application or system after the tenant has been offboarded. Finally, document the offboarding process and maintain a record of the decommissioned tenant for auditing and compliance purposes.</p>
			<p>Tenant onboarding and offboarding focus on managing the entire life cycle of a tenant within the SaaS application, including creating and removing tenant-specific resources, configurations, and customizations, while user provisioning and de-provisioning primarily deal with individual user account management, such as creating, updating, and deleting user accounts within the context of an existing tenant.</p>
			<p>This should give you a good start in addressing the specific challenges involved in securing a multi-tenant application. In the next section, we’ll consider the other added complexity that we have introduced – microservices.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>Microservices architecture considerations</h2>
			<p>Microservice architectures <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>offer significant advantages, as we have discussed in an earlier chapter, but they do come at the cost of some additional complexity. In this section, we will discuss some of the additional complexities that come from working with microservices.</p>
			<h3>Centralized authentication and authorization</h3>
			<p>In a<a id="_idIndexMarker628"/> microservices-based SaaS application, implementing centralized authentication and authorization is important for managing access control across multiple services consistently and efficiently. Centralizing these processes ensures that each service adheres to a uniform security policy and reduces the risk of misconfigurations or inconsistencies that could lead to vulnerabilities.</p>
			<p>One common approach to centralizing authentication and authorization in a microservices architecture is by using an IAM service, such as Azure AD or Identity Server. The IAM service acts as a single source of truth for user authentication, and it provides a unified way to manage roles, permissions, and access tokens across all services.</p>
			<p>When a user attempts to access a protected resource, the request is first sent to the IAM service for authentication. If the user is successfully authenticated, the IAM service generates an access token, which typically includes the user’s identity, roles, and permissions. This access token is then passed along with subsequent requests to other services, allowing each service to authorize the user based on the token’s contents.</p>
			<p>To implement centralized authentication and authorization in your microservices architecture, consider the following best practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use an established IAM service or framework that supports industry-standard protocols, such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, to facilitate interoperability and simplify integration.</li>
				<li>Secure communication between services and the IAM service using encryption, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>HTTPS or <strong class="bold">mutual Transport Layer </strong><strong class="bold">Security</strong> (<strong class="bold">mTLS</strong>).</li>
				<li>Implement token validation and caching mechanisms in each service to minimize performance overhead and protect against token tampering or replay attacks.</li>
				<li>Regularly review and update the roles and permissions defined in the IAM service to ensure they accurately reflect the functionality and access requirements of each service.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Please note<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> that implementing such a system is outside the scope of the demo app but would serve as a good project for any readers wishing to continue to advance their understanding of this topic.</p>
			<h3>API gateway and access control</h3>
			<p>In a<a id="_idIndexMarker631"/> microservices-based SaaS application, an API gateway plays a crucial role in managing and securing access to your services. The API gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests, providing a unified layer of access control and simplifying the process of managing security across your microservices.</p>
			<p>By consolidating access control at the API gateway, you can enforce consistent authentication and authorization policies across all services without duplicating the logic in each individual service. This reduces the complexity of your services, as they can focus on implementing their specific functionality rather than handling access control directly.</p>
			<p>When a client sends a request to access a protected resource, the API gateway intercepts the request and performs the necessary authentication and authorization checks. This may involve validating access tokens, verifying user roles and permissions, and applying rate limiting or other security measures. If the request meets the required criteria, the API gateway forwards the request to the appropriate service. Otherwise, the request is denied, and an error message is returned to the client.</p>
			<p>To implement access control at the API gateway effectively, consider the following best practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Choose an API gateway solution that supports your authentication and authorization requirements, such as Ocelot, Kong, or Azure API Management. Ensure the solution is compatible with your chosen IAM service and can efficiently handle token validation and permission checks.</li>
				<li>Configure the API gateway to enforce access control policies consistently across all services, including validating access tokens, checking user roles and permissions, and applying rate limiting or other security measures.</li>
				<li>Secure communication between the API gateway and your services using encryption, such as HTTPS or mTLS, to protect against data breaches and man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
				<li>Monitor and log access attempts at the API gateway level to gain insight into potential security threats and help with auditing and compliance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> implementing access control at the API gateway, you can enhance the security of your microservices-based SaaS application while simplifying management and ensuring a consistent access control policy across all services.</p>
			<h3>Service-to-service communication and authentication</h3>
			<p>In a <a id="_idIndexMarker633"/>microservices-based SaaS application, secure communication between services is essential to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your system. Service-to-service authentication helps ensure that only authorized services can communicate with each other, protecting your application from unauthorized access or potential security threats.</p>
			<p>To implement secure service-to-service communication and authentication, you can leverage a variety of techniques and protocols depending on your application’s requirements and architecture. Some common approaches include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">mTLS</strong>: With <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>mTLS, both the client and server services present TLS certificates during the TLS handshake process, allowing each service to verify the identity of the other. This approach provides strong authentication, encryption, and data integrity, making it a popular choice for securing service-to-service communication in microservices architectures.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Token-based authentication</strong>: In <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/>this approach, services use access<a id="_idIndexMarker636"/> tokens, such as <strong class="bold">JSON Web Tokens</strong> (<strong class="bold">JWTs</strong>), to authenticate themselves when communicating with other services. The access token typically contains information about the service’s identity and may include additional claims, such as roles or permissions. To validate the token, the receiving service verifies the token’s signature and checks the claims against its access control policies.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">API keys</strong>: API keys<a id="_idIndexMarker637"/> are unique identifiers that can be used to authenticate services when they make requests to other services. API keys are usually pre-shared secrets, meaning they must be securely distributed to each service and kept secret to prevent unauthorized access. To authenticate a request, the receiving service checks the provided API key against a list of valid keys and, if matched, grants access.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker638"/> implementing service-to-service communication and authentication, consider the following best practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Choose an authentication method that meets your security requirements and is compatible with your existing infrastructure and services.</li>
				<li>Encrypt communication between services using transport-level security, such as HTTPS or mTLS, to protect data in transit.</li>
				<li>Implement token or API key validation and caching mechanisms to minimize performance overhead and protect against token tampering or replay attacks.</li>
				<li>Regularly rotate and revoke tokens, certificates, or API keys to limit their potential exposure and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By implementing secure service-to-service communication and authentication, you can protect your microservices-based SaaS application from unauthorized access and potential security threats, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your system.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Managing users, roles, and permissions</h1>
			<p>In SaaS applications, managing user access efficiently and securely is extremely important. User provisioning and deprovisioning are essential processes for controlling access to resources and ensuring that only authorized users have the necessary permissions. Let’s explore these processes in detail!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>User provisioning and deprovisioning</h2>
			<p>User provisioning<a id="_idIndexMarker639"/> is the process of creating, updating, and managing user accounts and their access rights within a system or application. This process typically involves creating user accounts with unique identifiers, such as usernames or email addresses. Once the accounts are created, roles or permissions are assigned to users based on their responsibilities within the organization. Furthermore, enforcing password policies, such as minimum length, complexity, and expiration periods, ensures that user accounts remain secure.</p>
			<p>Automated provisioning can be particularly beneficial for larger organizations or when integrating with external identity providers (e.g., Azure AD or OAuth2). By automating the provisioning process, you can reduce manual errors in user account creation and role assignment, improve the onboarding experience for new users, streamline the management of user access across multiple services or applications, and enhance security by ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific resources.</p>
			<p>User deprovisioning<a id="_idIndexMarker640"/> is the process of revoking a user’s access rights when they are no longer required, such as when an employee leaves the company or changes roles. This process typically involves disabling or deleting the user account and revoking any assigned roles or permissions. In some cases, it may also be necessary to archive or transfer any associated data. Logging the deprovisioning process is crucial for auditing and compliance purposes.</p>
			<p>Timely and accurate deprovisioning is essential for maintaining security and minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. By implementing a systematic deprovisioning process, you can prevent former employees or contractors from accessing sensitive data or resources, reduce the potential for security breaches caused by orphaned or inactive accounts, streamline the management of user access, and ensure that only current employees have the appropriate permissions. Additionally, a thorough deprovisioning process helps you comply with data protection and privacy regulations that require the prompt removal of user access.</p>
			<p>A considered approach to user provisioning and deprovisioning ensures that security is maintained, access rights are accurately managed, and compliance with data protection and privacy regulations is upheld throughout the entire life cycle of a user’s interaction with the SaaS application.</p>
			<p>This is an important topic, and the processes should be agreed upon and implemented early in the life cycle of the application. By implementing robust processes for both tasks, you can enhance security, maintain compliance, and streamline access management across your application’s ecosystem.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Role management and assignment</h2>
			<p>In SaaS applications, managing roles and assigning them to users is a crucial aspect of access control. Roles define a set of permissions that determine the actions a user can perform within the application. By effectively managing roles and assigning them to users, you can achieve a higher level of security and maintain a clear separation of responsibilities.</p>
			<p>Role management <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>involves creating and maintaining a set of roles that represent different levels of access or responsibilities within your application. These roles should be designed to reflect the various tasks and functions that users need to perform. For example, you may have roles such as “administrator,” “manager,” “editor,” and “viewer,” each with a distinct set of permissions. Role management also includes updating roles as needed, such as when new features are added to the application or when existing permissions need to be adjusted.</p>
			<p>Role assignment is <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>the process of associating users with specific roles. By assigning roles to users, you can ensure that each user has the appropriate level of access to perform their job duties without granting them unnecessary permissions. Role assignment can be done manually, through an automated process, or via integration with external identity providers, such as Azure AD or OAuth2.</p>
			<p>To optimize role management and assignment, consider the following best practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Define roles based on POLP, which means granting users the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks.</li>
				<li>Regularly review and update roles to ensure they accurately reflect the current requirements of your application.</li>
				<li>Implement a consistent process for role assignment, such as using templates or automation, to minimize human errors and simplify access management.</li>
				<li>Monitor role assignments and access logs to identify any discrepancies or potential security risks.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>effectively<a id="_idIndexMarker644"/> managing roles and assigning them to users, you can achieve a more secure and well-organized access control system within your SaaS application. This not only enhances security but also promotes a clear separation of responsibilities and facilitates compliance with data protection and privacy regulations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>Permission management and fine-grained access control</h2>
			<p>Permission management<a id="_idIndexMarker645"/> involves defining a set of actions or resources that users can access within your application. These permissions can then be assigned to roles or, in some cases, directly to users. Fine-grained access control goes beyond defining a set of actions or resources by allowing you to create highly detailed and specific permissions for a wide range of scenarios.</p>
			<p>Fine-grained access control <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>offers several benefits, including enhanced security, improved efficiency, and easier compliance. By providing users with only the necessary permissions, you minimize the potential for unauthorized access or actions that could compromise your application’s security. With more precise access control, users can quickly find and interact with the resources they need while avoiding unnecessary clutter and distractions. For example, a marketing manager may only need access to customer data relevant to their campaigns and can avoid being overwhelmed by irrelevant data. If we think back to our secure building example, we can imagine that the areas of the building are very clearly signposted or maybe color-coded, making it very clear and obvious who is allowed into which parts of the building!</p>
			<p>To implement fine-grained access control in your SaaS application, it’s important to identify and define the specific actions and resources that users may need to access your application, taking into account different roles and responsibilities. Create a permissions hierarchy that organizes permissions logically and makes it easier to manage and maintain access control. Assign permissions to roles or users based on POLP, ensuring that users have the minimum access required to perform their tasks. For example, a <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>customer support representative may only need access to customer records and basic account information, while a manager may need access to more sensitive financial data.</p>
			<p>Regularly review and update permissions to ensure they accurately reflect the current requirements and functionality of your application. Monitor and audit permission assignments and access logs to detect discrepancies or potential security risks.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we explored the fundamental concepts of authentication and authorization in SaaS applications. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically through the use of credentials such as a username and password. Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining what actions a user is authorized to perform within the application, typically using <strong class="bold">access control lists</strong> (<strong class="bold">ACLs</strong>) or RBAC systems.</p>
			<p>We discussed how authentication and authorization are closely related and work together to provide a secure environment for users to interact with the application. In a SaaS application, the consequences of a data leak can be severe, and getting authentication and authorization right is critical to preventing data leaks and protecting sensitive data.</p>
			<p>We also discussed how implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms is particularly important in a multi-tenant application, where each tenant’s data and resources must be protected from unauthorized access by other tenants or outside parties. Technical considerations for implementing authentication and authorization in a SaaS application include using a microservices architecture, implementing isolation techniques, and implementing automated testing and monitoring.</p>
			<p>We explored some of the business considerations for implementing authentication and authorization in a SaaS application. These include clearly defining tenant boundaries and responsibilities, developing a clear pricing model, and providing a comprehensive onboarding (and offboarding) process.</p>
			<p>Finally, we have worked through a practice example that adds authentication and authorization to our demo application!</p>
			<p>By addressing both technical and business considerations, a SaaS application can provide a secure, reliable, and scalable platform that meets the needs of both application developers and tenants. Implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms can help to prevent data leaks and protect sensitive data while providing a clear and transparent pricing model and a comprehensive onboarding process can help to establish the application as a trusted provider of valuable services.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn about testing. Testing is a very important topic, particularly when dealing with SaaS applications. We will cover strategies for testing across the application stack.</p>
