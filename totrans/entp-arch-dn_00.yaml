- en: Thanks for acquiring this book! It was born out of the need to industrialize
    Information Systems. Software is everywhere but, apart from a few high-cost applications,
    it is full of bugs and costs a lot in maintenance, and most developers spend half
    their time reinventing the wheel or fighting against the Information System to
    add some new features.

    years working specifically on digital transformation for many different organizations.
    These diverse experiences convinced me that the root problem is always the same:
    the software industry does not actually follow the rules of industrialization,
    which are to decompose systems into smaller ones and join modules together with
    standards-obeying interfaces.'

    alignment, along with their sources and possible solutions. But most of my customers
    have told me that I stood out as a consultant because I was able to not only provide
    boards of directors with a clear transformation plan but also to accompany it
    with advice on semantics all the way down to the API contracts, and even some
    hands-on help in the code for the hard bits. They said this made the whole partnership
    more tangible and provided visible business results, so this is how I wanted this
    book to be: some theory first because we need to switch the way we think and create
    Information Systems, but some code as well because too many of them are not efficient
    today.'

    from a small lawyers firm to industry/logistics enterprises and to some huge farming
    cooperatives, I am convinced applying industry concepts to software design and
    architecture will become a more and more cost-effective approach, particularly
    since software and data are becoming the competitive backbone of most organizations
    nowadays.

    authentication, authorization, electronic document management, and, most importantly,
    thinking in terms of business functions rather than technically, is of utmost
    importance if you want to transform an Information System from a cost center to
    a strong asset of an organization.

    digital transformation and how it can be strategized. Finding out about the most

    is about setting a vision of an absolutely perfect Information System that would
    be completely aligned with business needs and where changes would be as easy as
    the original design. Even if this utopic system will never exist in reality, it
    will help you understand how externalizing functions and strictly separating responsibilities
    can make existing Information Systems more efficient and ease their evolution

    to build a second API implementation, this time complexified by the fact that
    this service has to use webhooks and create a local cache of data in order to
    reduce calls to the first data referential service. Though it does not add any

    System that has been built can now support all kinds of changes by being impacted
    by side effects or losing its ability to evolve further. In this chapter, we will
    change the data structure, the GUI, and the business rules, particularly authorization,

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This first part of the book is not technical at all and aims to provide a good
    understanding of what business-/IT-alignment is all about. It explains the difficulties
    and shortcomings in existing information systems and how some industrialization
    approaches may help overcome these problems. This is useful for anyone confronted
    with digital transformation. People with an IT system that does not deliver on
    its functional promises is hard to evolve, and is not cost-effective should also
    get a better understanding of why this is the case. After explaining causes and
    symptoms, this part of the book proposes a theoretical approach in the form of
    a utopic system that would be free of all these shortcomings and will guide our
    work in the next parts.
