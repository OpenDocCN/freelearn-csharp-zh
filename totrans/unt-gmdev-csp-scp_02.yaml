  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Transforming objects in Unity, such as adjusting their position, rotation, and
    scale, is a fundamental aspect of game development that allows you to precisely
    control how objects are situated and appear within your game world. These transformations
    are primarily managed through the **Transform** component, which is inherent to
    every GameObject in Unity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In the **Inspector** window, the **Transform** component displays three key
    properties: **Position**, **Rotation**, and **Scale**. Each property has three
    fields corresponding to the *X*, *Y*, and *Z* axes, allowing for detailed adjustments
    to be made in 3D space. To modify the position of an object, you simply enter
    new values in the **Position** fields, effectively moving the object to the specified
    coordinates in your scene. Rotating an object involves changing the values in
    the **Rotation** fields, which rotate the object around the respective axes. Lastly,
    scaling an object involves adjusting the **Scale** fields, which increase or decrease
    the size of the object along each axis. These changes are reflected in real-time
    in the **Scene** view, providing immediate visual feedback on your adjustments.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    guided, thanks to Unity’s transformation tools. These tools, accessible from the
    toolbar or by using hotkeys (*W* for **Move**, *E* for **Rotate**, and *R* for
    **Scale**), present interactive gizmos when an object is selected. The **Move**
    tool displays arrows for dragging the object along the axes, the **Rotate** tool
    shows circular handles for intuitive rotation, and the **Scale** tool provides
    boxes that you can drag to resize the object. This direct manipulation in the
    **Scene** view allows for a more hands-on approach to positioning, rotating, and
    scaling, offering a complementary method to the numerical precision available
    in the **Inspector** window.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Unity, a **Prefab** is a powerful feature that allows developers to create,
    configure, and store a GameObject with all its components, properties, and child
    objects as a reusable asset. Prefabs serve as templates from which you can create
    new instances in your scenes, ensuring consistency and efficiency in game development.
    They are ideal for objects that are repeated within the game, such as props, characters,
    or UI elements, allowing for centralized management and updates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using Prefabs has several advantages. First, they streamline the development
    process by enabling you to create complex objects once and reuse them across multiple
    scenes or even different projects. Any changes that are made to a Prefab are automatically
    propagated to all its instances, making it incredibly efficient to update game
    elements globally. This not only saves time but also ensures uniformity and reduces
    the risk of errors when making widespread modifications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    window into a folder within the **Project** window. This action converts the GameObject
    into a Prefab, indicated by a blue cube icon next to its name.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Adding Prefab instances to a scene is as simple as dragging the Prefab from
    the **Project** window into the **Scene** view or the Hierarchy window. Each instance
    is independent in terms of its specific properties, such as position and rotation,
    but it remains linked to the original Prefab for shared characteristics and components.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Editing a Prefab can be done in two ways. You can directly modify the Prefab
    in the **Project** window by opening it in Prefab Mode, where changes affect the
    Prefab itself and all its instances. Alternatively, you can make overrides to
    specific instances in your scene through the **Inspector** window; these changes
    will only apply to the selected instance. To apply changes from an instance to
    the Prefab itself, select the instance, make your modifications, and then click
    the **Overrides** dropdown in the **Inspector** window. From there, you can choose
    to **Apply All** to update the Prefab, ensuring all instances reflect the changes.
