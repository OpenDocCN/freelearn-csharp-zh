                    <h1 class="header-title">To the HoloLens and Beyond</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we will look into how we can work with HoloLens to understand how to make <strong>Mixed Reality</strong> games and apps. The main focus will be to code with the HoloLens device in mind but be able to use the simulator for both the HoloLens and the Mixed Reality viewer. This will allow us to be able to test and view what is happening, regardless of whether we have the actual HoloLens device.</p>
<p>The learning objectives of this chapter are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning what Mixed Reality is</li>
<li>Understanding how Mixed Reality works</li>
<li>Implementing a basic Mixed Reality prototype</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What is Mixed Reality, and how does it work?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Mixed Reality</strong> is known as <strong>MR</strong> or <strong>XR</strong> (<strong>extended reality</strong>) and can refer to Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, a combination of AR and VR into a single application or game, or it can be a reference to the game world being driven and modified by the real world. There are many ways to incorporate aspects of both <strong>Augmented Reality</strong> (<strong>AR</strong>) and <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> (<strong>VR</strong>) and by extension XR into a single application or a game.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Microsoft exclusively uses the MR for Mixed Reality; however, the terms XR and MR can be used interchangeably, with people being able to understand what you are referencing.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look of a few notable examples of Mixed Reality games by Gbanga Millform Inc and dissect why they are Mixed Reality instead of just AR or VR games. Two games that I feel are very notable are Smart Urban Golf (<a href="https://gbanga.com/gameography/smart-urban-golf/">https://gbanga.com/gameography/smart-urban-golf/</a>) and Urban Hunt (<a href="https://gbanga.com/gameography/gross-stadt-jagd/">https://gbanga.com/gameography/gross-stadt-jagd/</a>).</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Urban Hunt</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Urban Hunt is an iOS and Android platform real-time game where players have to run and escape from a car that is hunting them throughout the city of Zurich. The game lasts anywhere from 90 minutes (one-and-a-half hours) to 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours). The winner receives a Mercedes-Benz CLA Shooting Brake car in real life. Look at this screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/ba4bde75-0d42-405a-bc52-992af80df57c.png"/></div>
<p>The text in this image is not important. It's an image of Urban Hunt in use</p>
<p>The game incorporates GPS and location-based data to build the game world. The game is built to be played by everyone in the city of Zurich. The game has an AI that you the player have to run away from in real time.</p>
<p>Now, let’s break down what is AR, VR, and MR about this game.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mceNonEditable">Right away, we can see that there are no elements of VR added to this game at all. So, we don’t have to worry about that aspect of MR. It utilizes GPS, location data, and the city map of Zurich in the game. This means the game has some aspects of AR built into it by design. Moving on, it has MMO elements; this is neither AR or VR specific, but rather just massively multiplayer-online-game specific. Finally, the AI is what you the player have to run away from. This is where XR or MR comes into play. The reason for this is you don’t control the character with button prompts; you are the character, and it is based on your real-life walking and running movements. This is the aspect of augmenting the game world with real-world interactions or, conversely, augmenting the real world with a game world.</p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking, <em>that last sentence is the literal definition of AR</em>, but let’s break it down further. The game is not projecting into the real world, nor is the real world being fully projected into the game. The AI solely lives in the game world and you (the player) are simultaneously in the game world and the real world. You still have to pay full attention to the rules and the AI of the game world, in addition to the rules and struggles of real life. This is how it is Mixed Reality, instead of just Augmented Reality.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Smart Urban Golf</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Smart Urban Golf is a game where you play golf using your cell phone as the club, and you hit golf balls in the game world. You can practice by playing the driving-range mode, which makes the game generate random courses based on your current position, or you can play in a live tournament mode where you compete with others for the highest score on the online leaderboards. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Look at this screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/47e38d68-021d-47cd-907f-083c2b9c59d0.png"/></div>
<p>Smart Urban Golf</p>
<p>Breaking down the elements of the game, we can see that the golf club being the phone automatically places AR as one of the technologies being utilized. The location-based random courses means that Geolocation and GPS are being heavily utilized, which is mainly found in AR applications. Competing with others is a standard game mechanics. The ball is living in the game world only but is affected by the golf club (your cell phone), so the game is XR or MR.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">XR applications in media</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>With these two example games being showcased, we should have a better idea of what XR or MR is. But I think we can go a bit further—what about using VR and AR together? There are certain people on YouTube who utilize the mixture of AR and VR together so the viewer can see what they see in the game as well as their body positions at the same time as using VR applications. Take a look at this:</p>
<div><img src="img/4b489827-8477-4fb0-b8a9-4cdbc1a7c880.png"/></div>
<p>Jazza</p>
<p>Here we see Jazza from Draw with Jazza is sculpting a model in a VR application with Oculus Rift. We can see what he is sculpting along with him working from outside the application. This is an example of utilizing XR to enhance the viewing experience of a third party.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>But let’s also take a look at an XR video for gaming as well. Take a look at this:</p>
<div><img src="img/56dce9f5-5000-4be7-b426-a4dc1ca4cf12.png" style="width:30.08em;height:16.92em;"/></div>
<p>Brometheus</p>
<p>Brometheus is playing a game called Nevrosa Prelude with the HTC Vive, and it is also a VR game but has AR projected to enhance the viewing experience of a third party.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">XR with HoloLens</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is all well and good, but let’s take one more look with a HoloLens example this time around. Take a look at this:</p>
<div><img src="img/01869e28-2a69-4f3c-ba42-5c86882f605a.png" style="width:34.25em;height:19.25em;"/></div>
<p>Minecraft</p>
<p>During the E3 demo of the HoloLens and Minecraft in 2015, we saw an AR projection of the game in the real world along with the person using the HoloLens in VR mode.</p>
<p>One last example with the HoloLens and <strong>Windows Mixed Reality</strong> (<strong>WMR</strong>) should suffice, as I think all of these examples combined into one really exemplify the MR or XR full experience. Let's take a look at this:</p>
<div><img src="img/307eef3e-3c95-4963-8698-b6be27149fc3.png" style="width:55.25em;height:31.08em;"/></div>
<p>The text in this image is not important. It gives you an example of Mixed Reality with fragments</p>
<p>The game in this screenshot is called <em>Fragments</em>, which is an adventure-style detective game. What makes this MR or XR over pure VR is that the game will scan where you are and allow the objects and characters in the game interact with it seamlessly. As you can see from the screenshot, the character is sitting on the player’s sofa.</p>
<p>What we have learned in this section is that XR or MR is essentially taking VR and AR elements and incorporating them into real-world environments and situations with seamless integration. This is the backbone of how we can take AR or VR to the next level for a proper Mixed Reality integration.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting Mixed Reality ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The HoloLens requires your computer to meet a couple of requirements; this includes the requirements for supporting Hyper-V and being VR-ready. This is also true for utilizing the HoloLens emulator. So, what requirements do we need to meet? Take a look at the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>64-bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise or Education editions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using Windows 10 Home edition, it does not support Hyper-V or the HoloLens emulator.</p>
<ul>
<li>64-bit CPU </li>
<li>CPU with four or more cores, or multiple CPUs with a minimum total of four cores</li>
<li>8 GB of RAM or more</li>
<li>GPU with support for DirectX 11.0 or later</li>
<li>GPU with <strong>WDDM</strong> (<strong>Windows Display Driver Model</strong>), 1.2 driver or later</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need a bios that supports the following features, and have them enabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware-assisted virtualization</li>
<li><strong>Second-Level Address Translation</strong> (<strong>SLAT</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Hardware-Based Data Execution Prevention</strong> (<strong>DEP</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft has a handy list of specifications to meet, for both laptop and desktop computers, for minimum and recommended settings. Alternatively, you can use software on the Microsoft Store to run a PC check for compatibility (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-mixed-reality-pc-check/9nzvl19n7cnc">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-mixed-reality-pc-check/9nzvl19n7cnc</a>).</p>

<p>Microsoft specs</p>
<p>Hyper-V must be enabled on your system. Let's follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>To enable Hyper-V, go to the Control Panel:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/a96a09e4-85ae-4021-83d1-faf28ff1d198.png"/></div>

<ol start="4">
<li>Select Turn Windows features on or off:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/54e55d46-de14-4993-b3b4-a9c1efd64ae3.png" style="width:22.75em;height:20.25em;"/></div>
<p>Windows features</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Select all Hyper-V features by putting a check mark in and clicking the OK button:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/ee11d3dd-21a7-40cb-b420-2605df3e9290.png"/></div>
<p>Enable Hyper-V</p>
<p>Next up, we need to be absolutely certain that we have Visual Studio set up in the proper manner. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Visual Studio Installer from your Start menu. If you have the Visual Studio Community edition, it will work too:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/5fef6643-debe-4f46-8609-d8acae896255.png"/></div>
<p>VS Installer</p>
<p>We need to make certain that we have the most up-to-date version of Visual Studio. So, if it tells you to update instead of modify, do the update first.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Now we need to click on Modify and, then, once things are ready, click on Individual components:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/8c4f30b9-be4a-4409-8b31-1ecc49810a92.png" style="width:42.75em;height:4.17em;"/></div>
<p>Individual components</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Scroll down until you see the list of Windows 10 SDKs. We need the latest one, which is 10.0.17134.0, and also the Windows 10 SDK for UWP C#, which is version 10.0.16299.0:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/3e7a163c-ef58-42f5-ad16-b26bb692dccf.png"/></div>
<p>Windows 10 SDK</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The last thing we need to do, if you haven't followed any other chapter in this book, is to make sure your minimum version of Unity is 2017, although we will be using the latest version of Unity, which is 2018.1.6f1. If you don't have it, make sure to update using the Unity Hub:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/282c0bd9-ae6f-41b4-8a38-404f129abe69.png"/></div>
<p>Latest Version of Unity</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>We also need to make sure we have the Windows Store .NET Scripting Backend, Windows Store IL2CPP Scripting Backend, and Windows IL2CPP Scripting Backend, to make sure we can translate from Unity specific code over to Windows code effectively:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/c0332c6a-84ab-4627-97bf-da7713cdddbb.png"/></div>
<p>Unity Components</p>
<p>It will require a total of 8.8 GB in size on your hard disk.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Project overview</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This project will be a basic prototype that will make sure that we can simulate a basic model can be displayed when viewed in HoloLens.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Playing with Mixed Reality</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let's begin by first downloading the model we will be using with this project. Once again, let's follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.turbosquid.com/">turbosquid.com</a> and type <kbd>scifi</kbd> as the search parameters:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/60d4f2eb-7586-4742-ba83-3644d6058a84.png"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Next, change the pricing to Free:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/52d23d85-b72b-431c-a149-ffb8fde0dcd0.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Find one you like. I like robots and I use FBX format, as I find it easy to use with multiple projects and game engines. So, I will select this one:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/0c53ad8d-7426-4fc8-9d30-947797deec65.png"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>It will take you to a download page, so make sure you select the correct file you want and if it has a <kbd>textures</kbd> folder, download that as well:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/2548532d-71b2-451a-b10e-bf12ff5a4aa6.png"/></div>
<p>Download robot</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Go to the folder where you downloaded the zip file and extract it:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/47368b09-2bbe-4223-84a5-07f36a50a110.png"/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Now we can jump into Unity. Create a new project and I will call this one <kbd>Chapter8</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/0a0e4659-14d5-4ec5-9774-f61679e73f6b.png"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Create a new folder called <kbd>Models</kbd>:</li>

<ol start="8">
<li>Import the model into the project:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/7bd6693e-bece-4321-9af8-614e2bec6db8.png"/></div>
<p>We now need to go through the steps to install the HoloLens Emulator. I should note that this will only work for Visual Studio, 2015 edition. If you have Visual Studio 2017 or later, you can use the Mixed Reality simulator that is built into the Windows 10 SDK. Let's follow the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=823018"> http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=823018</a> to download the simulator.</li>
<li>Click on the installer to begin the installation process:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/9337b245-63a0-4cec-90fc-3e46cceecc92.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>It will ask you if you want agree to using the CEIP program; choose your answer and click Next:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/b41355a0-25b1-4410-b7c4-6e76480eaf1f.png"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Next up will be the standard Microsoft License Agreement; I would suggest reading it to know what you are agreeing to, and then click Accept afterward:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/addd7e66-0b76-4940-aa03-46ac9651fe93.png"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Select the features you want to install; I would suggest getting both the emulator and the templates for future reference. Click Install:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/1bc44e86-dec4-47ce-8b41-8d2cca50c6ba.png" style="width:47.58em;height:34.83em;"/></div>
<p>Now we can begin to set up the remaining portions of the project.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up the camera</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since we or the user are using the HoloLens, we will be the first-person camera; it is important to remember that our starting position should always default to the Vector 3 values of x being <kbd>0</kbd>, y being <kbd>0</kbd>, and z being <kbd>0</kbd>. Everything else should always be offset according to that knowledge.</p>
<ol>
<li>So, the first thing to do will be to click on the camera in the Hierarchy pane:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/5751fd9c-3f27-4f36-9fc4-04e96c0b2d78.png"/></div>

<p>Default camera values</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>We need to change this to X being <kbd>0</kbd>, Y being <kbd>0</kbd>, and Z being <kbd>0</kbd>. Look at this screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/d3cb2d03-228d-488a-b9b5-d471ab04c3fc.png"/></div>
<p>Modified camera values</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>With this being made for HoloLens, we don't need a Skybox texture; we want everything the camera renders. To do this, we need to change the Clear Flags from the default values.</li>
<li>The default values for the Clear Flags is Skybox:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/e9839111-f31b-44df-85d6-2829176ddfe3.png"/></div>
<p>Default Clear Flags</p>

<p>Clear Flags modified</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Next, we need to click on the background option underneath Clear Flags, which will open a color-picker window and change the RGBA values set to this: <kbd>0</kbd>,<kbd>0</kbd>,<kbd>0</kbd>,<kbd>0</kbd>:</li>
</ol>

<p>As with any other game or application, performance is a very important thing to keep in mind. We need to maintain a high frame rate for Mixed Reality headsets and the HoloLens. As these headsets don't have many years of being on the market and aren't upgradable like PCs, Android phones, iOS devices, or consoles yet, it is best to keep the Quality Settings set to the lowest values possible.</p>

<p>The next step is to make sure we set the target we need for building, in this case, the Windows 10 SDK. First things first, we need to change the scripting backend. Let's follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>To do this, open the Build Settings menu:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>Now change the target from PC, Mac &amp; Linux to Universal Windows Platform:</li>
</ol>

<p>We are getting down to the final steps of this prototype project. So, let's add and configure our robot into the scene to get going into the home stretch. You know what to do—follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to add the robot to the scene:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/6380415b-c9bd-41f9-ada1-e12508e9b2cf.png"/></div>
<p>Add robot</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>There are a few values we need to change, the first of which will be the position from the Inspector pane, then the rotation, and finally the scale. The default values place it to be at the origin of the player and is too big to be of any use currently:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/3cbfa98e-fb81-4d07-b034-8d059f94b6b4.png"/></div>
<p>Robot Inspector</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The X position should be set to <kbd>0.26</kbd>, to account for the slight offset that we have from the groupings. The Y position should be set to <kbd>0</kbd>, and the Z position should be set to <kbd>2</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/c0fe1e1f-79b6-4810-ae4b-331e205ae825.png"/></div>
<p>Position</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Next up is the rotation; we will set the X rotation to be <kbd>45</kbd>, the Y rotation to be <kbd>45</kbd>, and the Z rotation to be <kbd>45</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/b4ea2e56-3af1-4562-8ba8-fded09a56259.png"/></div>
<p>rotation</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Last, but certainly not least, is the scale. The X scale will be set to <kbd>0.6</kbd>, the Y scale set to be <kbd>0.6</kbd>, and the Z scale to be <kbd>0.6</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/e50fd8c9-2fac-4e4c-83f1-9c609381fb11.png"/></div>

<p>We learned about how Mixed Reality works and a few different techniques we can apply from the theory to practical use. We looked at some examples of Mixed Reality and set up our computers to build for Mixed Reality, using the HoloLens Simulator.</p>
<p>Moving beyond this book, I would suggest going more into the VR side of things or perhaps looking into what Microsoft has done for the HoloLens, as most of its applications and games are open source and on GitHub. There are many fascinating things to learn and incorporate into AR and XR applications; it is still a brand-new aspect of game and application development, so experiment and test out new ideas.</p>
