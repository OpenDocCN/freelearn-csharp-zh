    for creating microservices with .NET, no matter whether they should run on-premises,
    on Microsoft Azure, or in any other cloud environment. In this book, you will
    learn how to get the most out of .NET Aspire when you build your solutions.'

- en: Creating ASP.NET Core minimal APIs (an easy and fast option for creating REST
    services) is just a small part of creating applications using a microservices-based
    architecture. This book covers all the different aspects that are needed for building
    a successful solution. Accessing databases, both relational as well as NoSQL;
    using Docker and deploying Docker images; automatic deployment with GitHub actions;
    monitoring the solution with logging, metrics data, and distributed tracing; creating
    unit tests, integration tests, and load tests; automatically publishing the solution
    to different environments; and using binary, real-time, and asynchronous communication
    – all of this is covered in the book.

    and an overview of the components comprising the Codebreaker application. Subsequently,
    you will engage in coding using ASP.NET Core minimal APIs, crafting code for data
    interaction with both relational and NoSQL databases through **Entity Framework**
    (**EF**) Core, utilizing Azure Cosmos DB and SQL Server, and generating client
