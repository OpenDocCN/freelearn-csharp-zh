<p>Itâ€™s well-known today that F# has been quite a first class citizen, a built-in part of programming language support in Visual Studio from Visual Studio 2010. F# is a programming language that has its own unique trait: it is a functional programming language, and at the same time, it has OOP support. F# has run on .NET until now, although we can also run F# as a cross-platform language, such as on Android (using Mono). </p>
<p>Although F# mostly runs faster than C# or VB when doing computations, F# has its own unique performance characteristics. Some of the performance characteristics might not be so obviously identified and code implementations might have implicit bad practices and subtleties that may lead to performance bottlenecks. The bottlenecks may or may not be faster than C#/VB counterparts, although some of the bottlenecks may share the same performance characteristics, such as the use of .NET APIs.</p>
<p>The main goal of this book is to identify the performance problems in F#, measuring and optimizing F# code to run more efficiently, while also maintaining the functional programming style as appropriately as possible.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This book focuses on optimizing F#. A basic skill of F# knowledge (including functional programming concept and basic OOP) is a prerequisite to start understanding its performance problems and optimizing F#.</p>

<p>We need to ensure that we have met all of the software and hardware requirements and that we&#160;have their correct versions as well.</p>
<div class="section" title="Basic requirements and setup environments"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl2sec1"></a>Basic requirements and setup environments</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The&#160;following are the requirement specifications for an F# environment:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Visual Studio 2015 Update 3. The minimum edition is Community Edition because it is the free minimum version of Visual Studio, which&#160;has extensibility support and Visual F# (also F# project templates) as part of the installation. Express Edition is not recommended because it has no F# project templates built in.</li>
<li class="listitem">.NET 4.6 as the minimum target runtime.</li>
<li class="listitem">Windows 7 SP1 (Windows 8.1 Update 1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit is recommended)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The following are the Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 hardware requirements:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">4 GB RAM on Windows 7 SP1 or 6 GB RAM on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.</li>
<li class="listitem">At least a Core 2 Duo or Athlon processor. It is recommended to have Core i5 as it is also a recommendation for a Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 machine. Also, using Core i5 will provide easier illustrations to see multi core in action when we discuss concurrency in Chapter 4 and 5.</li>
<li class="listitem">Approximately 12 GB to 15 GB of disk space with Windows 10 UWP installed (without Android development feature).</li>
<li class="listitem">DirectX 9.0c capable display adapter.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For more information, please check the requirement specification on MSDN:</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>We recommend having at least 8 GB of RAM. This minimal memory size is recommended in order to have an optimal experience for not just running F# code. For large F# projects, Visual Studio IDE will load type information, metadata and debug symbols in the background, and Visual Studio's memory consumption will quickly climb to more than 3 GB. This is why 64-bit Windows is recommended as it allows us to use RAM higher than 4 GB.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the <code class="literal">include</code> directive."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">[&lt;EntryPoint&gt;]
let main argv = 
    printfn "Hello F# world"
    0 // return an integer exit code
</pre>
<p>If there is a line (or lines) of code that needs to be highlighted, it is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">[&lt;EntryPoint&gt;]
let main argv =
<span class="strong"><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160; printfn "Hello F# world"</strong></span>
&#160;&#160;&#160; 0 // return an integer exit code</pre>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>New terms</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>important words</strong></span> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> button moves you to the next screen."</p>
<div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note2"></a>Note</h3>
