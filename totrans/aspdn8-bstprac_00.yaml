  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*ASP.NET 8 Best Practices* contains over 100 best practices used in the ASP.NET
    community, covering topics such as how to squeeze the best performance out of
    your ASP.NET web application, what Entity Framework patterns are available, how
    to design a minimal web API, and how to structure Visual Studio projects based
    on project type.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The standards covered in the book include version control, creating software
    pipelines, creating structured middleware, security practices, Entity Framework
    Core patterns and techniques, and automating time-consuming client-side tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll also look at common practices when testing your code, when and how to
    apply exception handling, how to design the best API for web applications, how
    to optimize a web application for performance, and finally, review common terms
    and guidelines when building ASP.NET web applications.

- en: While best practices are considered recommendations on how to write professional
    code, there will always be exceptions to the rule. As developers know, there are
    so many ways to write code to achieve the same result. Some ways are better than
    others. These “better ways” are what I consider best practices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we cover each topic, we’ll provide as much detail and referral material to
    explain why these techniques and patterns are indeed a better way to write professional
    code. However, it doesn’t mean they are written in stone. As mentioned previously,
    there will always be exceptions to the rule.

    build a new ASP.NET website and see everything associated with the process. This
    book is meant to lessen the feeling of being overwhelmed by understanding each
    technology “spoke” attached to an ASP.NET website “hub.” It explores everything
    involved in creating a “simple” website.

- en: To seasoned developers already using ASP.NET, use this book as a reference for
    recommendations and the observations I’ve gathered over a 20-year career. Even
    my experiences with past and present colleagues are included in this book.

    used as a reference to gain more clarity on an ASP.NET topic at any time. After
    finishing the book, you will have a better understanding of the common practices
    used throughout the industry, whether you’re a solo developer or work in a Fortune
