<p>This chapter helps you explore and choose between the different locations at which data for games can be stored. This chapter explores a range of locations and strategies for separating your game data from the logic, and for loading the data when needed. It also explores ways to save runtime data between Scenes, through static variables and the Unity PlayerPrefs system. A method of saving screenshots when the game is running is presented. Two recipes illustrate how to load and save game components as Unity Asset Bundles.</p>

<p>This chapter presents different ways for using text files in games to represent and communicate data. Creating, reading, and writing to text files can be performed in many ways, and apart from generic plain text files, there are the common data interchange text file formats of JSON and XML. This chapter presents a range of recipes for creating, reading, and writing to text files with different types of text content. These are useful for games that save data locally to the device they are running on, and also when communicating with online clients.</p>

<p>This chapter presents some of the additional features of Unity 2018 not covered elsewhere in the book. In this chapter, we will present a range of additional Unity features that we wanted to include, such as slow motion, gizmos, and a pause-game recipe. With VR, such an up-and-coming feature of games, we also include a set of recipes illustrating VR game development in Unity.</p>

<p>This chapter introduces ways in Unity to automate the testing of code and GameObjects. Having a set of automated tests that can be executed quickly means that when programmers and game designers make changes to a game, they can quickly check that no unintended consequences have been created, which either give rise to errors or make GameObjects behave in ways they are not meant to. In this chapter, we will introduce the Unity Test Runner, and we will present recipes illustrating how to automate isolated testing of code (unit tests), and runtime testing of the interaction of code and the Unity system (such as physics and animation) in play-mode tests. The recipe concludes with both play-mode and unit testing of a health bar game component, illustrating logging and exceptions.</p>
