    all of the Sure Step content and tools in minutes. Project managers and consultants
    can also make themselves familiar with, and knowledgeable about, Sure Step through
    **Microsoft Official Courseware** (**MOC**), Microsoft Online learning, and Learning
    Snacks and **Instructor-Led Training** (**ILT**) courses provided by **Microsoft
    Certified Partners for Learning Solutions** (**CPLS**). This means that, with
    a modest time investment, organizations can obtain Sure Step methodology tools,
    content, and knowledge. So, is putting your organization on the Sure Step tracks
    as easy as pie? As many of us know, that couldn't be further from the truth. Any
    organization looking to adapt their processes to adopt a new implementation methodology
    is bound to face a certain set of challenges. To succeed, they will need an effective
    strategy, which they must execute properly while managing the organization change,
    and these are not exactly small matters!

    hand-in-hand. Strategy execution can be defined as *all of the actions necessary
    to turn your strategy into success*. A great strategy cannot compensate for a
    poor execution, and vice versa. The book *Strategy Execution Heroes*, *Jeroen
    De Flander*, *The Performance Factory*, lists four important differentiators when
    comparing strategy execution with strategy building. Strategy execution involves
    everyone in the organization, while strategy building is mostly reserved for a
    selected executive team. Strategy execution takes much longer than strategy building—it's
    a marathon versus a sprint. Execution requires short- and long-term thinking as
    short-term wins are a necessity to make execution a success. Strategy execution
    also requires a different skill set from strategy building. Successful strategy
    builders are champions in analytical thinking and opportunity identification,
    whereas executioners are masters in communication and coaching skills.

    De Flander*，《绩效工厂》，在比较战略执行与战略制定时列出了四个重要的区别。战略执行涉及组织中的每个人，而战略制定主要保留给选定的执行团队。战略执行所需的时间比战略制定长得多——这是一场马拉松而不是短跑。执行需要短期和长期思考，因为短期胜利是使执行成功所必需的。战略执行还需要与战略制定不同的技能集。成功的策略制定者是分析思维和机会识别的冠军，而执行者则是沟通和辅导技能的大师。

    During strategy building, we may look to define our quality goals as well as generate
    plans on how we could achieve those quality excellence goals using Microsoft Dynamics
    Sure Step as our vehicle. But having a strategic plan in and of itself does not
    guarantee success. A strategy, even a great one, doesn't implement itself! To
    turn the Sure Step strategy into execution, an organization will need to put a
    plan in place for a company-wide effort using management coaching support to detail
    the incremental steps needed to achieve quick wins on the way to a larger transformation.
    The execution of this process is a completely different ballgame as compared to
    acquiring resources with knowledge on how to drive implementations successfully.

- en: 'Now you may be wondering why coaching based on these GROW principles is emphasized
    in this chapter about Sure Step adoption. The answer is simple: because this model
    is most effective in generating the awareness and responsibility of your people.
    We want people to take responsibility in our transformation project as only they
    can realize the desired change. As long as people blame others when things go
    wrong or don''t work as expected, they are not committed to the outcome.'

  zh: 现在你可能想知道为什么基于这些GROW原则的辅导在本章关于Sure Step采用中受到强调。答案很简单：因为这个模型在产生你员工的意识和责任感方面最为有效。我们希望人们在我们的转型项目中承担责任，因为只有他们才能实现预期的变革。只要人们在事情出错或不符合预期时责怪他人，他们就不会对结果做出承诺。
- en: Responsibility goes hand-in-hand with choice. When people make choices, they
    are committed to them because they feel responsible. This is exactly what we want
    when we want to execute our change strategy. Our people need to feel responsible
    for executing Sure Step principles in their daily professional reality. An important
    detail is that they need to make the choices. By asking questions and exploring
    their daily perceived reality, a coach can help commit to action in order to realize
    the agreed upon objectives. A coach must not make the choices; we want true commitment.
    A good coach is an active listener, provides perspective, is someone who can make
    their peers think, and someone who can make them be receptive to new input and
    see new options because of that.

    Step原则的责任。一个重要的细节是他们需要做出选择。通过提问和探索他们日常感知的现实，教练可以帮助承诺采取行动，以实现达成一致的目标。教练不应做出选择；我们希望得到真正的承诺。一个好的教练是一个积极的倾听者，提供观点，是能够让他们的同伴思考的人，也是能够使他们接受新的输入并因为这一点看到新选项的人。

    meet a broad business process or need, and may need a little variation to cover
    multiple verticals or industries. For example, bookkeeping, payroll, and human

- en: The third category, **complementary** solutions, can also be viewed as horizontal
    solutions because these solutions can also be used in multiple verticals or industries.
    But while horizontal solutions can address multiple processes for multiple verticals
    or industries, a complementary solution is a "point solution" that addresses a
    specific function for a vertical or horizontal market, and as such, complements
    a vertical or horizontal solution. Examples of complementary solutions include
    credit card validation, address lookup, or bar code solutions.

    in, you can benefit from aligning your solution's documentation to Sure Step methodology.

- en: As you already know, Sure Step is designed to assist with requirement gathering
    for the customer's solution. This leads up to a Fit Gap exercise to determine
    how much of the standard solution fits with the customer's requirements and whether
    any gaps exist that must be solved by other means. During the Fit Gap exercise,
    the **Value-Added Reseller** (**VAR**) and/or service provider may determine that
    a subset of the requirements can be best met by an ISV solution. If this determination
    occurs in the diagnostic presales phase, having appropriate documentation such
    as requirements questionnaires and Fit Gap worksheets would assist the VAR or
    service provider with selecting the right ISV solution. As an ISV provider, this
    is your primary benefit as it enables the selection of your ISV solution. Even
    if the determination occurs only during the implementation, foreseeably during
    the Functional Requirements and Fit Gap workshops in the Analysis phase, these
    documents will once again help the service providers ascertain that they are making
    the right ISV selection.

- en: The more recognized your ISV solution becomes in the Microsoft Dynamics ecosystem,
    the more demand you are going to have for your product, which without any doubt,
    is a good problem to have. But with that also comes organizational scale issues.
    Do you have the resources to assist on multiple sales opportunities, or do you
    have the resources to support implementation questions as they arise? Having your

    Step对齐可以帮助您解决这些问题。
- en: The other inherent benefits of the Sure Step alignment are alleviating project
    risks and improving solution delivery times. As we have learned in the prior chapters,
    having a consistent, repeatable, and end-to-end life cycle method that Sure Step
    provides helps the service provider decrease the overall risks and issues that
    may arise during the engagement. This, in turn, can also lead to reduced deployment
    times, thereby reducing the overall solution delivery costs for the customer.
    If your ISV application is a component of the overall solution being deployed
    for the customer, ensuring that it also aligns with Sure Step will only help make
    life easier for the implementation team. They will be able to find artifacts for
    the appropriate activities, thereby reducing the overall delivery time for this
    component. They will also be using a single taxonomy in describing and implementing
    the overall solution, which is not something to overlook. The customer user base
    goes through enough churn as it is during the course of an **Enterprise** **Resource
    Planning** (**ERP**) or **Customer Relationship Management** (**CRM**) solution
    implementation; they do need to also have to figure out multiple terms thrown
    at them to describe the same task.

  zh: Sure Step 对齐的其它内在好处包括缓解项目风险和提高解决方案交付时间。正如我们在前面的章节中学到的，拥有一个Sure Step提供的持续、可重复和端到端的生命周期方法，可以帮助服务提供商降低在合作过程中可能出现的整体风险和问题。这反过来也可以减少部署时间，从而降低客户整体解决方案交付成本。如果你的ISV应用程序是客户部署的整体解决方案的一部分，确保它也符合Sure
    Step将只会帮助实施团队的生活更加轻松。他们能够找到适当活动的工件，从而减少该组件的整体交付时间。他们还将使用单一分类法来描述和实施整体解决方案，这是不容忽视的。在**企业资源规划**（ERP）或**客户关系管理**（CRM）解决方案实施过程中，客户用户基础本身就经历了足够的波动；他们确实需要弄清楚多个术语来描述相同的任务。
- en: Having good Sure Step-based documentation can also reduce the time taken for
    a service provider to become an expert on your ISV solution. As these consultants
    go into other engagements, they become evangelists for your product, resulting

    training for this part of the overall solution to the customer's users.

- en: In this case study, we look at the journey of a small Dynamics partner (let's
    call them Partner1) to adopt Sure Step methodology. The clientele of Partner1
    is predominantly in the **Small-to-Medium Enterprise** (**SME**) space. Partner1
    is a VAR and solution implementer whose main focus is not only the Microsoft Dynamics
    CRM solutions, but also undertaking smaller ERP engagements. Partner1 has 24 employees,
    including six in sales, 15 in consulting, and three in administrative/accounting/infrastructure
    roles.

  zh: 在这个案例研究中，我们关注一个小型Dynamics合作伙伴（让我们称他们为Partner1）采用Sure Step方法论的过程。Partner1的客户群主要集中在**中小企业**（**SME**）领域。Partner1是一家增值经销商和解决方案实施者，其主要关注点不仅限于Microsoft
    Dynamics CRM解决方案，还承担较小的ERP项目。Partner1有24名员工，包括6名销售人员，15名顾问，以及3名行政/会计/基础设施岗位的员工。
- en: 'Partner1 was struggling in two areas: a spotty win-loss ratio on the opportunities
    it was chasing and inconsistency in its solution delivery resulting in less-than-satisfied
    customers. In a way, the two issues were tied together: the lack of good customer
    references was causing it to lose out to the competition more often than not.'

  zh: Partner1在两个领域遇到了困难：在追逐的机会上，胜负比不均衡，以及解决方案交付的不一致性导致客户满意度不高。从某种意义上说，这两个问题相互关联：缺乏良好的客户参考导致它经常输给竞争对手。
- en: The CEO of Partner1 first learned of Sure Step at a Partner Conference, where
    he was also able to see a demo of the methodology. He came away impressed with
    the capabilities, and also felt that it could help his organization in both of
    its current struggles. But before embarking on the evaluation exercise, he wanted
    to get affirmation from others in his organization that this was worthwhile to
    pursue, and he accordingly asked his Consulting Director to evaluate whether Sure
    Step would be a good fit for them.

  zh: Partner1的首席执行官首次在合作伙伴会议上了解到Sure Step，在那里他还看到了该方法论的演示。他对这些能力印象深刻，并认为这可以帮助他的组织解决当前的两大难题。但在开始评估练习之前，他希望得到他组织内其他人的确认，认为这是值得追求的，因此他要求他的咨询总监评估Sure
    Step是否适合他们。
- en: The Consulting Director of Partner1 and a Senior Project Manager reviewed the
    100-level online training course on Sure Step, accessible through PartnerSource.
    They were also convinced that the time and effort to further evaluate Sure Step
    would be money well spent, with the Consulting Director going as far as feeling
    that it was essential to their survival as an organization.

    Step的时间和精力将是一笔值得的投资，咨询总监甚至认为这对他们组织的生存至关重要。
- en: As a first step, they downloaded Sure Step from Microsoft's PartnerSource website
    to get a better grasp of the guidance, artifacts, and tools available to them.
    The second step was to institute a Train-the-Trainer model, where the Senior Project
    Manager would undertake a deep-dive, instructor-led classroom training on Sure
    Step and then come back and educate the rest of the organization on Sure Step.
    After other key consulting resources received training on Sure Step, the company
    would evaluate whether and how the methodology needed to be customized to fit
    their processes. They would also select a project and use Sure Step on a trial
    basis.

  zh: 作为第一步，他们从微软的PartnerSource网站上下载了Sure Step，以更好地了解他们可用的指导、工件和工具。第二步是实施培训师培训模式，其中高级项目经理将进行深入的、讲师主导的课堂培训，然后回来教育组织中的其他成员关于Sure
    Step的知识。在其他关键咨询资源接受了Sure Step的培训之后，公司将评估是否以及如何需要定制该方法论以适应他们的流程。他们还将选择一个项目，并试用Sure
    Step。
- en: While the plan was fairly logical, the execution did not quite pan out as Partner1
    had intended. First, while the training that the Project Manager attended delivered
    the Sure Step knowledge, Partner1 still needed to go through an exercise of mapping
    their processes and deliverables to Sure Step methodology. This required dedicated
    resources and time. This was task that the Project Manager, whose primary job
    was to keep his/her current customer project on the right track, did not have
    the luxury to carry out. Partner1 also felt a bit overwhelmed by the documentation
    that they thought was needed in Sure Step and struggled with aligning their internal
    taxonomies between sales and delivery. Finally, as the sales team was not involved
    in this exercise, the selling motions, and more importantly the deliverables promised
    by the sales teams were not aligned with the new approach that the delivery team
    wanted to take. The project stayed mired on the shelf, and it was business as
    usual for Partner1\. The problem was that their sales and delivery struggles continued
    as well.

  zh: 虽然计划相当合理，但执行并没有像Partner1所期望的那样顺利进行。首先，虽然项目经理参加的培训传达了Sure Step的知识，但Partner1仍然需要通过将他们的流程和交付成果映射到Sure
    Step方法论中进行练习。这需要专门资源和时间。这是一个项目经理的任务，他的主要工作是确保他/她的当前客户项目保持正确的轨道，他没有这样的奢侈时间去完成。Partner1还觉得Sure
    Step中他们认为需要的文档有点令人不知所措，并且在与销售和交付之间的内部分类法对齐方面遇到了困难。最后，由于销售团队没有参与这项练习，销售动作以及更重要的是销售团队承诺的交付成果并没有与交付团队想要采取的新方法保持一致。项目陷入了停滞，对于Partner1来说，一切照旧。问题是他们的销售和交付困境还在继续。
- en: At this juncture, the CEO was able to meet with a Microsoft executive and another
    partner at an event. The discussion and follow-up notes exchanged affirmed his
    belief that Sure Step could help alleviate his company's struggles and also led
    him to go after a more sound adoption approach.

- en: Partner1 decided to use the Sure Step Adoption Roadmap for guidance. Having
    already identified a compelling reason to adopt Sure Step, the first step for
    Partner1 was to assign a Sure Step champion for the project. The Project Manager
    was designated as the Sure Step champion, and she was also relieved of some of
    her day-to-day pressures so as to be able to focus on the adoption. Partner1 nominated
    a V-team that comprised of a Sales Manager, the Consulting Director, and other
    consultants. The team availed of the Sure Step Online self-assessments to analyze
    where they were as an organization and what steps they needed to take to improve
    their processes.
