<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p>Parallel programming and concurrency have become prevalent in modern software development. In this book, you will learn how to leverage the latest asynchronous, parallel, and concurrency features in .NET 6 when building your next application. We will explore the power of multithreaded C# development patterns and practices. By exploring the benefits and challenges of threading in .NET through concise, real-world examples, choosing the right option for your project will become second nature.</p>
<p>You have many choices when introducing multithreading to a new or existing .NET application. The goal of this book is to not only teach you how to use parallel programming and concurrency in C# and .NET but also to help you understand which of the constructs to choose for a given scenario. Whether you are developing for desktop, mobile, the web, or the cloud, performance and responsiveness are key to the success of an application. This book will help every type of C# developer to scale their applications to their users’ needs and avoid the pitfalls often encountered with multithreaded development.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for beginner- to intermediate-level .NET developers who want to employ the latest parallel and concurrency features in .NET when building their applications. You should have a solid understanding of the C# language and some version of the .NET Framework or .NET Core.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B18552_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managed Threading Concepts</em>, covers the basics of working with managed threading in .NET. We will discuss how to create and destroy threads, handle exceptions, synchronize data, and the objects provided by .NET to handle background operations. You will gain a basic understanding of how threads can be managed in a .NET application. Practical examples in this chapter will illustrate how to use managed threading in C# projects.</p>
<p><a href="B18552_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor034"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Evolution of Multithreaded Programming in .NET</em>, introduces some of the concepts and features that will be explored in more depth in later chapters, including async/await, concurrent collections, and parallelism. You will learn how their options are expanded when selecting how to approach concurrency in applications.</p>
<p><a href="B18552_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor061"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Best Practices for Managed Threading</em>, covers some best practices when it comes to integrating managed threading concepts. We will cover important concepts such as static data, deadlocks, and exhausting managed resources. These are all areas that can lead to unstable applications and unexpected behavior. You will be given practical advice to avoid these pitfalls.</p>
<p><a href="B18552_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">User Interface Responsiveness with Threading</em>, explains how to use ThreadPool in .NET. The real-world examples in this chapter will give you valuable options for ensuring UI responsiveness in your .NET applications.</p>
<p><a href="B18552_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Asynchronous Programming with C#</em>, explains asynchronous programming in C# and explores the best use of tasks in .NET. </p>
<p><a href="B18552_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor098"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Parallel Programming Concepts</em>, delves deeper into the <strong class="bold">Task Parallel Library</strong> (<strong class="bold">TPL</strong>) and tasking concepts.</p>
<p><a href="B18552_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Task Parallel Library (TPL) and Dataflow</em>, introduces the TPL Dataflow Library and illustrates some common patterns for its use through in-depth examples.</p>
<p><a href="B18552_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor130"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Parallel Data Structures and Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)</em>, explores some of .NET’s useful features, including <strong class="bold">Parallel LINQ</strong> (<strong class="bold">PLINQ</strong>). Follow along with some practical examples of PLINQ in C#.</p>
<p><a href="B18552_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor146"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Concurrent Collections in .NET</em>, dives deeper into some of the concurrent collections that help provide data integrity when using concurrency and parallelism in your code. </p>
<p><a href="B18552_10_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor158"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Debugging Multithreaded Applications with Visual Studio</em>, teaches you how to use the power of Visual Studio when debugging multithreaded .NET applications. This chapter will explore the tools in detail through concrete examples.</p>
<p><a href="B18552_11_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Canceling Asynchronous Work</em>, dives deeper into the different methods available to cancel concurrent and parallel work with .NET. You will gain a deep understanding of how to safely cancel asynchronous work.</p>
<p><a href="B18552_12_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor186"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Unit Testing Async, Concurrent, and Parallel Code</em>, provides some concrete advice and real-world examples of how developers can unit test code that employs multithreaded constructs. These examples will illustrate how unit tests can still be reliable while covering code that performs multithreaded operations.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>To follow along with the examples in this book, the following software is recommended for Windows developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0 or later</li>
<li>.NET 6</li>
</ul>
<p>While these are recommended, if you have the .NET 6 SDK installed, you can use your preferred editor for most of the examples. For example, Visual Studio 2022 for Mac on macOS 10.13 or later, JetBrains Rider, or Visual Studio Code will work just as well. However, for any WPF or WinForms projects, Visual Studio and Windows are required. Newer versions of Visual Studio and .NET, when they are released, should also work with the examples in this book.</p>
<p>You are expected to have a foundational knowledge of C# and .NET with a working knowledge of <strong class="bold">Language Integrated Query</strong> (<strong class="bold">LINQ</strong>).</p>

<p><strong class="bold">If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code from the book’s GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.</strong></p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with LINQ, there is a great C# reference on Microsoft Docs to get you started before working through the examples in this book: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/">https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/</a>.</p>
<p>After reading this book, I would also recommend exploring the posts on the .NET Parallel Programming team blog. Most of the articles are several years old, but they explore the thinking behind many of the decisions made when building the .NET libraries that expose parallel programming constructs: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/</a>.</p>

<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre class="source-code">    private async Task MultiplyValue()</pre>
<pre class="source-code">    {</pre>
<pre class="source-code">        await Task.Delay(100);</pre>
<pre class="source-code">        <strong class="bold">var currentTotal = Interlocked.Read(ref </strong></pre>
<pre class="source-code"><strong class="bold">            _runningTotal);</strong></pre>
<pre class="source-code">        <strong class="bold">Interlocked.Exchange(ref _runningTotal, </strong></pre>
<pre class="source-code"><strong class="bold">            currentTotal * 10);</strong></pre>
