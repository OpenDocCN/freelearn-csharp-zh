- en: Cinder is one of the most powerful open source creative coding frameworks that
    is available right now on the Internet. It is based on one of the most popular
    and powerful intermediate-level programming language C++ and relies on minimum
    third-party libraries. It is a combination of low-level and high-level language
    features, and that makes it relatively easy to grasp for those who have a higher-level
    programming language background.

- en: Cinder can be considered the next-level creative coding framework for those
    who are familiar with Processing, ActionScript, or other similar high-level programming
    languages or frameworks. Cinder may seem similar to openFrameworks, it is, in
    terms since it is based on C++, but the philosophy behind the framework is a bit
    different.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: openFrameworks is based on a lot of third-party libraries that do the job and
    sometimes may make a simple application to be big in size. Cinder is different
    in terms, that is, it tries to make use of the features of the operating system
    that it runs on. It does not mean that it is better than openFrameworks, but for
    some scenarios it may be more efficient than the other one.

    Estonia just introduced computer programming learning for all children attending
    school, meaning that everyone from Grades 1 to 12 are learning how to code. It
    is not hard to believe that there will be a lot of other countries that will follow.
    This means that in the future computer technology will be everywhere more than
    it is today and the situation will demand a vast amount of people who will need
    to take care of it. Another fact is that we most probably will see programming
    in more and more fields that previously had weak or absolutely no connection to
    it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is where creative coding comes in. Creative coding is becoming more
    and more popular these days as even more people start to appreciate the logical
    and interactive dimension that programming can give to their work. It is possible
    to create a painting that paints itself, a live sculpture, or an interactive chair
    that does not let anyone to sit on it—the possibilities are endless. It is only
    the matter of ones creativity and programming knowledge.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One thing that is important in todays creative coding frameworks is performance
    and flexibility. Usually the more powerful and flexible a framework is, the harder
    it is to learn it. As Cinder is both, flexible, and powerful, it is not an easy
    task to understand how to use it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is a trial to make the Cinder learning curve less steep. Through a
    collection of simple guided examples, we will try to cover the basic functionality
    that is usually provided by other creative coding tools.
