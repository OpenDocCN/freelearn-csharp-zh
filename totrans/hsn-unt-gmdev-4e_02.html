    <h1 id="_idParaDest-15" class="chapterTitle">Embark on Your Unity Journey</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we will learn how to install Unity and create a project with Unity Hub, a tool that manages different Unity versions and projects, among other tasks. Unity Hub gives easy<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> access to community blogs, forums, resources, and learning portals; it also manages your licenses and allows managing different installs and projects.</p>
    <p class="normal">Specifically, we will examine the following topics in this chapter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Installing Unity</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating projects</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by talking about how to get Unity up and running. If you already know how to install Unity, feel free to skip ahead to <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Crafting Scenes and Game Elements</em>. If you are already familiar with Unity’s editor, you can jump to <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">From Blueprint to Reality: Building with Terrain and ProBuilder</em>, where we start creating the book’s project.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-16" class="heading-1">Installing Unity</h1>
    <p class="normal">We’ll begin <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>with a simple but necessary first step: installing Unity. It seems like a straightforward first step, but we can discuss the proper ways to do this. In this section, we will be looking at the following concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Unity’s technical requirements</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Unity versioning</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Installing Unity with Unity Hub</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">First, we will discuss what is necessary to run Unity on our computers.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-17" class="heading-2">Unity’s technical requirements</h2>
    <p class="normal">To run the<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> Unity 2023 editor, your computer will need to meet the requirements specified here: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.2/Documentation/Manual/system-requirements.html"><span class="url">https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.2/Documentation/Manual/system-requirements.html</span></a></p>
    <p class="normal">Here is a summary of what’s specified in the link:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">If you use Windows, you need Windows 10.7 version 21H1 (19043) or higher. Unity will run only on 64-bit versions of those systems; there is no 32-bit support unless you are willing to work with Unity versions before 2017.x, but that’s outside the scope of this book.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">For Mac, you need Big Sur 11.0.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">For Linux, you need exactly Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Regarding the CPU, these are the requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Your CPU needs to support 64 bits</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Your CPU needs to support SSE2 (most CPUs support it)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">In the case of Macs with Apple silicon, M1 or above is needed. For Intel Macs, any with x64 and SSE2 support will work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Finally, regarding graphics cards, these are the supported ones:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">On Windows, we need a graphics card with DirectX 10, 11, or 12 support (most modern GPUs support it)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">On Mac, any Metal-capable Intel or AMD GPU will be enough</li>
      <li class="bulletList">On Linux, OpenGL 3.2 or any superior version, or a Vulkan-compatible card from Nvidia and AMD is supported</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Note that these are not the requirements for a user to play your game, but for you to use the editor. For the requirements for a user to play your game, please read the following documentation: <a href="https://docs.unity.cn/ru/2021.1/Manual/system-requirements.html#player"><span class="url">https://docs.unity.cn/ru/2021.1/Manual/system-requirements.html#player</span></a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Now that we know the requirements, let’s discuss the Unity installation management system.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-18" class="heading-2">Unity versions</h2>
    <p class="normal">At this book is being written, Unity announced a shift in their versioning system. The current release, Unity 2023.2, will be the final iteration of the 2023 series. The next version, which was supposed to be 2023.3 LTS, will instead be launched as Unity 6. This transition marks the end of the <strong class="keyWord">LTS</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">Long-Term Support</strong>) release cycle, which forced Unity to undertake several releases each year. Moving forward, we anticipate the sequential roll-out of Unity versions 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and so forth, each offering a stable platform enriched with new features.</p>
    <p class="normal">LTS versions have the benefit that they are planned to be updated bi-weekly with bug fixes for 2 years, while new major versions of Unity release. That’s the reason most companies stick to LTS versions of the engine: because of its stability and long-term support. In this book, we will be using 2023.1 just to explore the new features of the engine, but consider sticking to LTS versions when developing commercial game titles.</p>
    <p class="normal">Considering this, you may need to have several versions of Unity installed in case you work on different projects made with different versions. You may be wondering why you can’t just use the latest version of Unity for every project, but there are some problems with that.</p>
    <p class="normal">In newer versions of Unity, there are usually lots of changes to how the engine works, so you may need to rework lots of pieces of the game to upgrade it, including third-party plugins. It can take lots of time to upgrade the whole project, and that can push the release date back. Maybe you need a specific feature that comes with an update that will help you. In such a case, the cost of upgrading may be worthwhile. In projects that require maintenance and updates over several years, developers typically adhere to the existing version, opting to upgrade only when a new update includes a necessary feature.</p>
    <p class="normal">Managing different projects made with different Unity versions, and installing and updating new Unity releases, all used to be a huge hassle. Thus, <strong class="keyWord">Unity Hub</strong> was created to help us with this, and it has become the default way to install Unity. Despite this, it is not necessary for installing Unity, but we will keep things simple for now and use it. Let’s look closer into it.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-19" class="heading-2">Installing Unity with Unity Hub</h2>
    <p class="normal">Unity Hub is <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>a small piece of software that we will install before installing Unity. It centralizes the management of all your Unity projects and installations. You can get it from the official Unity website. The steps to download it change frequently, but at the time of writing this book, you need to do the following:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">

    <p class="normal">Now it is time to create a project using Unity.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-20" class="heading-1">Creating projects</h1>
    <p class="normal">Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>we have Unity installed, we can start creating our game. To do so, we first need to create a project, which is basically a folder containing all the files that your game will be composed of. These files are called <strong class="keyWord">assets</strong> and there are different types of them, such as images, audio, 3D models, script files, and so on. In this section, we will see how to manage a project, addressing the following concepts:</p>

    <p class="normal">If you want to move this project to another PC or send it to a colleague, you can just compress all those files and send them as a ZIP file, but not all the folders are necessary all of the time. The important folders are <code class="inlineCode">Assets</code>, <code class="inlineCode">Packages</code>, and <code class="inlineCode">ProjectSettings</code>. <code class="inlineCode">Assets</code> will hold all the files we will create and use for our game, so this is a must. We will also configure different Unity systems to tailor the engine to our game; all the settings related to this are in the <code class="inlineCode">ProjectSettings</code><strong class="keyWord"> </strong>and <code class="inlineCode">UserSettings</code> folders. Finally, we will install different Unity modules or packages to expand its functionality, so the <code class="inlineCode">Packages</code> folder will hold the ones we are using.</p>
    <p class="normal">It’s not necessary to copy the rest of the folders if you need to move the project elsewhere or add it to a versioning system, but let’s at least discuss what the <code class="inlineCode">Library</code> folder is, especially <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>considering it’s usually a huge size. Unity needs to convert the files we will use to its own format in order to operate; an example is audio and graphics. Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>supports <strong class="keyWord">MPEG Audio Layer 3</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">MP3</strong>), <strong class="keyWord">Waveform Audio File Format </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">WAV</strong>), <strong class="keyWord">Portable Network Graphics</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">PNG</strong>), and <strong class="keyWord">Joint Photographic Experts Group</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">JPG</strong>) files (and much more), but prior<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> to using<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> them, they need to be converted to Unity’s internal formats, a process called <strong class="keyWord">Importing Assets</strong>. Those converted files will be in the <code class="inlineCode">Library</code> folder. If you copy<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> the project without that folder, Unity will simply take the original files in the <code class="inlineCode">Assets</code> folder and recreate the <code class="inlineCode">Library</code> folder entirely. This process can take time, and the bigger the project, the more time is involved.</p>
    <p class="normal">Keep in mind that you<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> want to have all the folders Unity created while you are working on the project, so don’t delete any of them while you work on it, but if you need to move an entire project, you now know exactly what you need to take with you.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-23" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we reviewed how the Unity versioning system works. We also saw how to install and manage different Unity versions using Unity Hub. Finally, we created and managed multiple projects with the same tool. We will use Unity Hub a lot, so it is important to know how to use it initially. Now, we are prepared to dive into the Unity Editor.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will begin exploring basic Unity tools, laying the groundwork for authoring our first level prototype.</p>
