But even for premium titles, a degree of post-launch support is mandatory, and the days of shipping a box and immediately moving onto a new venture are over.</p><p class="calibre_2">Running a game development business has never been easy, and nowadays, our industry is as competitive and hit-driven as ever. With game development and marketing costs growing ever higher, building, maintaining, and repeatedly monetizing a dedicated fanbase has become a top priority. For players, on the other hand, the landscape is more inviting than ever! The abundance of high-quality Free to Play titles means that players can try as many games as they like, and play them for hundreds of hours without spending a penny.</p><p class="calibre_2">In this chapter, we will attempt to distill the knowledge required to turn your game into a successful service, from monetization tips and live operations strategy, to addressing game balancing, understanding analytics, customer support, and the tools required to run your games sustainably. Evolving business models presents great (and sometimes controversial) design challenges, but tackling them head-on may be your only chance of making a world-class hit.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_887"/>


<div id="filepos1014418" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Terms of engagement</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Before you begin thinking about designing, deploying, and running a live game, you ought to familiarize yourself with a large set of keywords and abbreviations used to describe various parts of the business. At first, these terms may seem a bit unwieldy, yet common language is essential when speaking about increasingly complex and fine-tuned products driven by dozens of people and hundreds of moving parts.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">The majority of the list is dedicated to </span></span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">KPIs</span></span></span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> (</span></span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Key Performance Indicators</span></span></span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">). These are the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the game. KPIs often revolve around financial data, marketing performance, as well as the current size, health, and the overall trends governing your player base.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">We’ll now unpack several key terms and use this as an opportunity to provide additional insight into the challenges of building and running Free to Play games.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_889"/>


<div id="filepos1015793" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Basic stats</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We'll start with some of the most critical KPIs that almost every member of the game team should understand and follow:</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Retention</span><br class="calibre1"/> One of the most important KPIs and the basis for your entire business. If you are to have any hopes of making back the costs of developing and running the game, as well as acquiring the user via paid marketing, you need to keep the players coming back regularly. After all, the longer someone plays, the larger the number of repeated opportunities they have to spend.</p><p class="calibre_2">Retention stats are generally reported as the percentage of players who return in the days after the installation day. The most popular retention KPIs are D1 (one day after installation), D7, D14, D30 (a month after installation), and D365 (a year later), the last being the ultimate testament to a game's longevity. Retention varies dramatically depending on the game's genre and the type of audience you attract. That said, in the mobile games industry, a D1 retention of 40-45% for organic users (players not attracted by paid marketing) is often the target to hit, with outstanding games reaching 60%.</p><p class="calibre_2">There are a few ways of calculating your retention, and some may be a bit misleading. Rolling retention, for example, considers users who launch the game just twice (on Day 0 and Day 17) as having retained for two weeks, putting them squarely in the D14 retention stat.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Daily Active Users and Monthly Active Users</span>
<span class="bold">(DAU and MAU)</span><br class="calibre1"/> Two critical KPIs used to monitor the size of the active player base. DAU sums the total number of users who logged into the game on a particular day. MAU, on the other hand, portrays the monthly total, regardless of frequency of engagement.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Concurrent Users (CCU)</span><br class="calibre1"/> A measurement of how many players are logged into the game right now. By tracking the CCU over time, you can find the most and least popular times across the week. This helps you determine the best days and hours to roll out new content, run server scripts, or start a new special event.</p><p class="calibre_2">CCU is a closely monitored KPI, and a sharp decline in the user count can be a telltale sign of infrastructure errors. Your technical staff will also use the CCU to work out the optimal server bandwidth. Nowadays, server instances can be added and removed remotely based on your current and future needs as well as the historical CCU data. This helps to keep the running costs low while ensuring there's enough capacity to avoid connection problems and server errors.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Conversion Rate (CVR)</span><br class="calibre1"/> The percentage of players who convert from a non-payer to a paying customer by spending money inside the game. The conversion rate varies dramatically depending on the genre, platform, territory, and the average player's age (players who are over 25 are much more likely to monetize). Mobile Free to Play games usually operate with a CVR between 1 and 5 percent.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Average Revenue Per</span>
<span class="bold">User and Average Revenue Per Paying User (ARPU and ARPPU)</span><br class="calibre1"/> These long acronyms describe the monthly revenue generated by an average user (ARPU) or by an average paying customer (ARPPU). The calculations are simple:<br class="calibre1"/>
<span class="italic">ARPU = Monthly Revenue ÷ MAU</span><br class="calibre1"/>
<span class="italic">ARPPU = Monthly Revenue ÷ (MAU ÷ Conversion Rate)</span><br class="calibre1"/> The time frame in these KPIs may differ, since some companies look at daily or 24-hour rolling data when calculating their ARPU and ARPPU stats.</p><p class="calibre_2">Moreover, you may also meet with ARPDAU, and as you've probably guessed from the acronym, it comes down to daily revenue divided by daily active users.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Lifetime Value</span> (<span class="bold">LTV</span>)<br class="calibre1"/> The combined spend by an average user throughout their entire time with the product is an ultimate testament to the effectiveness of your business model.</p><p class="calibre_2">Since we do not have data going into the future, the LTV will always be a forecast based on historical performance. By basing your LTV calculations on D1 retained users, you can reduce the noise generated by badly targeted marketing campaigns and lower-quality organic users (often associated with a large store feature).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_891"/>


<div id="filepos1020579" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Marketing and analytics</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Following our basic stats, we have a list of KPIs and terms mostly connected to the commercial performance of our game:</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Installs</span><br class="calibre1"/> New installs or new users are one of the key marketing KPIs, observed on a daily basis. Nowadays, most marketing campaigns can be tracked, allowing the team to directly attribute the user to a particular channel. Any unpaid install is treated as organic.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">K-factor and virality</span><br class="calibre1"/> In marketing, the k-factor represents the viral growth rate of existing users, inviting non-users into the service. It all comes down to a simple calculation of the number of invites sent per average user multiplied by the conversion rate of the invite.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">k = (invites ÷ user) × conversion</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Organic Uplift</span><br class="calibre1"/> The <span class="italic">Organic Uplift</span> represents the unattributed growth in organic (unpaid) installs. This can come as the result of store featuring, increased word of mouth, heightened brand awareness (social media posts, community work, and so on), untracked marketing such as newspaper and street adverts, or players simply seeing an advert online, not interacting with it, then searching for the product by themselves.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">CTR</span><br class="calibre1"/> Click-Through Rate, the ratio of users who interact with an advert (or any other, trackable event) to the total number of views (impressions). In games advertising, CTR is used to assess and compare the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Cost Per Install</span> (<span class="bold">CPI</span>)<br class="calibre1"/> Also known as the acquisition cost, this is a crucial KPI for any game that relies on paid marketing. CPIs can be highly volatile and easily inflated by huge marketing budgets of a few big companies who are competing over the same user base.<br class="calibre1"/> Nonetheless, in the crowded Free to Play market, the best (and often the only) way of growing your game profitably is to drive down the CPI (by adjusting the daily spend, marketing campaigns, and audience targeting options) and buy as many users as you can at a cost below their LTV.</p><p class="calibre_2">CPIs can make or break your game. A highly attractive and well-targeted game can get a 2 dollar CPI, while another, less appealing one, may have to spend $20 for a single retained player. And if $20 per user sounds utterly crazy and unsustainable, that’s because it usually is, unless your LTV sits comfortably above $20...</p><p class="calibre_2">It’s important to get an insight into the approximate CPI for your game before it enters actual production. To validate your marketing potential, set up a small-scale test ($500-$1000) with a few different versions of marketing screenshots that roughly represent your game and theme. Make sure to add competitive titles to the test to get some benchmark data. If you score way below the competition, consider testing a different theme or premise.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Cost Per Thousand Impressions</span>
<span class="bold">(CPM)</span><br class="calibre1"/> Even if all you care about is new users, impressions (converted or not) are what you actually pay for. CPM provides strong insight into the actual costs of online advertising and becomes especially useful when assessing the profitability of untracked campaigns such as print, television, and billboards.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Minnows, dolphins, whales</span><br class="calibre1"/> A three-step classification (originating from the gambling industry), used to distinguish between different tiers of monetizing players. While the exact numbers behind each tier often vary across the industry, this classification is tremendously popular in Free to Play games.</p><p class="calibre_2">To start with, minnows are the minor spenders (below 5 dollars/month), dolphins sit in the middle (<span class="italic">5-24.99 dollars/month</span>), and whales are the high spenders (<span class="italic">25+ dollars/month</span>). Occasionally, an extra tier is added above whales and reserved for players who spend more than 50 or 100 dollars/month.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Session stats (number and length)</span><br class="calibre1"/> Knowing the average amount of play sessions per day and their length can empower you to make better decisions when it comes to pacing and balancing your game, for example, by adjusting the length of individual rounds, or the number of resources generated by in-game actions.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_893"/>


<div id="filepos1025430" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Economy and balancing</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">To wrap up, let's delve into a set of terms and practices used in designing, analyzing, and balancing our in-game economies.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Freemium currency</span><br class="calibre1"/> Also known as soft currency, a relatively abundant in-game resource that can be accumulated by playing the game, without the need to spend money. Usually spent on basic content and gameplay needs.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Premium currency</span><br class="calibre1"/> Also known as hard currency, a scarce resource that is predominantly acquired by spending real money, although small amounts of premium currency may be awarded on a scheduled basis or from tightly limited objectives. Hard currency is used to access premium goods and services as well as to skip time and resource requirements.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Taps and sinks</span><br class="calibre1"/> In game economies, taps (or sources) generate resources while sinks are responsible for removing them. To avoid resource inflation and devaluation of your entire economy, you must maintain a tight grip on resource creation and provide players with deep, desirable sinks.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Energy</span><br class="calibre1"/> Action points, energy, fuel, keys, stamina, lives—these are but a few analogs for a resource designed to limit the amount of time you can effectively spend in the game. Usually, Energy resources replenish themselves over time, to a certain cap, which in some cases might be increased.</p><p class="calibre_2">Even though you can spend money to replenish energy, it is rarely intended as a significant monetization vector. The primary role of energy mechanics is to help control a player's play sessions and their rate of progression. Without Energy, some players would not only exhaust our content at an uncontrollable rate, but also burn themselves out in the process. What's fun for 10 minutes at a time might not be fun for 3 hours straight. Having a clear incentive to return (<span class="italic">Energy full!</span>) as well as an excuse to leave the game (<span class="italic">Out of Energy!</span>) can help maintain a healthy play cycle and establish a play habit around the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">On a side note, it's important to acknowledge a crucial difference between energy and lives. While Energy is usually spent on any significant action (such as entering a battle), Lives are only decreased upon failure. This means that a losing player will be forced out of the game (or incentivized to spend) sooner than a winning one. The long-term consequences of this difference are hard to predict and should be tested and assessed for each individual case.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Gacha box</span><br class="calibre1"/>Also known as a mystery box, loot box, or loot crate. Gacha boxes distribute rewards (such as resources, items, characters, vanity items, and other goods) in a randomized manner. More on designing gacha systems later in this chapter!</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Drop rate</span><br class="calibre1"/> The percentage chance for a player to receive a particular reward in a randomized scenario such as enemy loot drops, gacha boxes, and so on.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Pinch-point</span><br class="calibre1"/> Any part of the game's core progression that relies on artificially inflated difficulty (a moment of increased <span class="italic">friction</span>) in order to encourage spending. Most mobile level-based puzzle games (such as <span class="italic">Candy Crush Saga</span>) periodically feature extraordinarily difficult levels that facilitate the need for extra moves and boosts.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Pay-gate</span><br class="calibre1"/> Any part of a game's content that is designed to be assessed primarily via payment can be considered as <span class="italic">locked behind a pay-gate</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Grinding</span><br class="calibre1"/> The process of repeatedly completing an already mastered part of the game in order to complete a particular meta-objective. For example, amassing a large number of resources to buy an expensive item, or raising the experience level before tackling a particularly difficult challenge.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Churn rate and drop off points</span><br class="calibre1"/> Churn rate is the opposite of retention, it represents the number of players who stop playing the game (churn) after a defined period or at a specific point in time (after a new game update or server reset). High player churn prompts the search for drop-off points, areas of the game and features that prompt significant amounts of players to leave and never come back. To find the drop-off points, you'll need to collect game progression stats (last completed level or task, last unlocked item or game mechanic, total time played and so on) and use them to identify (and hopefully address) the most pressing issues.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Retention funnel</span><br class="calibre1"/>The funnel is a chronological representation of your data. When applied to retention analytics, it allows us to easily identify the biggest drop-off points.</p><p class="calibre_2">For example, if we wanted to improve our D1 retention, the easiest way would be to look for drop-off points in the key points of our <span class="bold">First Time User Experience</span> (<span class="bold">FTUE</span>). The funnel would look like this:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">10,000 Launched the game for the first time</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">9,500 Created a player profile</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">9,300 Entered the tutorial battle</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">8,000 Deployed units in battle</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">7,900 Finished the battle</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">6,000 Got to the end of the tutorial</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">A funnel like this immediately highlights a 14% high drop among players who entered the tutorial battle (9,300) and players who deployed their units (8,000). This highlights potential issues with this tutorial step and prompts further investigation and experimentation. Funnels like this can be applied on a wider scale, but the further your players get from the FTUE, the more uncertainty is introduced to your data.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Pay to win</span> (<span class="bold">p2w</span>)<br class="calibre1"/>A term used to describe games or systems where players can vastly increase their chances of winning by spending real money. The ability to convert money into in-game power does not automatically brand your game as such. The advantages of spending must be perceivable and seemingly out of reach to non-spending players.</p><p class="calibre_2">Multiplayer scenarios with pay to win dynamics are generally frowned upon in the western market. However, the same is not true for single player experiences, and eastern markets such as China, Japan, and Korea, where the cultural differences (and general maturity of the Free to Play market) play a major role in shifting away from this perspective. In fact, for many Chinese players, being able to afford premium game content is a source of pride.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">A/B Testing (also known as Split Testing)</span><br class="calibre1"/> A/B tests are a form of controlled experiments where different versions or configurations of the game are run simultaneously on two (hence A and B) or more groups of players. A/B testing typically allows for efficient and bias-free validation of various theories, from default control layouts to progression mechanisms and game difficulty.</p><p class="calibre_2">Each test is run for a set amount of time, after which the KPIs of different groups are compared and a winning configuration can be picked. Most tests are best run for at least a few weeks. It’s highly possible that the same change that causes a bit of a percentage drop in tutorial completion can also result in a significant increase in long-term retention and conversion rates. In most cases, extensive A/B testing is confined to the beta and soft launch periods, but it’s possible to utilize A/B tests for non-critical features across a game's entire lifespan.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember, players communicate with one another and it’s best if none of your players ever feel shortchanged by their test group assignment. Furthermore, it’s best to avoid any A/B tests that have clear, real-money implications, such as trying different price points for the same content. This kind of manipulation will almost certainly enrage the community and erode their trust.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_895"/>


<div id="filepos1034356" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Basics of Free to Play monetization</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Setting up and balancing the game economy, player progression rate, and the monetization model can be a daunting and time-consuming job. In well-staffed teams, these duties are addressed by a dedicated specialist, often known as an economy designer. In smaller, less specialized teams, the heavy burden of creating a successful game economy will often fall onto the generalist game designer.</p><p class="calibre_2">In theory, the business model of Free to Play games is simple. Lower the barrier to entry (free download) to attract a large audience, retain your players with fun gameplay, and provide them with ample opportunities to express themselves, save time, and enhance their gameplay by paying.</p><p class="calibre_2">In practice, it's a huge challenge, especially since you're operating within a saturated market and with an increasingly savvy audience that often expects to get most of their content for free, even after playing your game for months or even years. To have any hopes of succeeding in this difficult market, you'll need to develop a strong monetization strategy that reinforces an already strong gameplay loop.</p><p class="calibre_2">While the Free to Play business model is likely to leave a big impact on game design, you should not let monetization drive your prototypes and strip you of your creativity. Gameplay has to come first, since without it, you'll have no users to convert.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Do not blindly copy/paste monetization models from other successful games. You may not have the brand, breadth of content, and audience size to make them work. As an example, League of Legends' monetization works on a multi-million strong user base, that retains for years, but with it's tiny ARPU, its likely won't work for you!</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_897"/>


<div id="filepos1036509" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Vectors of monetization</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Buying a knife skin in <span class="italic">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</span> and purchasing a lollipop hammer in <span class="italic">Candy Crush</span> are two entirely different experiences. The first is driven by desire, the other by frustration. Knife skins give players a way to express themselves and provide visual variety, but they have no effect on gameplay. The value of the lollipop hammer, on the other hand, is almost entirely dependent on its gameplay impact, since it is a usable tool that helps you get past difficult situations. Your offering has to closely match your game and the desires of your players.</p><p class="calibre_2">There are four distinct vectors used to drive in-game monetization models:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Time</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Difficulty</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Playable content</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Non-playable content</li></ol><p class="calibre_2">We’ll explore these vectors one by one and pay close attention to their effect on gameplay, progression, structure, and a player's emotional state.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_899"/>


<div id="filepos1037890" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Time</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">This monetization vector is reinforced by the following emotions: anticipation (positive) and impatience (negative).</p><p class="calibre_2">Time and game progress are strongly intertwined, and Free to Play games often purposely (and gradually) slow down a player's progression rate in hopes of monetizing it. This can be done in two ways:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Explicitly via timers</span>: A centralized server-based clock can support a range of progress gating mechanics, from timers on crafting, building, training, upgrading, and unlocking your units, skills, and structures, to energy mechanics (which directly limit the playtime), and more subtle daily and weekly objectives that grant players important rewards (without which progress slows down significantly).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Implicitly via resources</span>: The prices of in-game content and Experience Points required to level up your avatars are often growing at an exponential rate. In these scenarios, players are given an option to continue playing the game for free, or to spend money and either accelerate resource generation or buy the item outright.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">The effectiveness of progression-based monetization depends on game balancing and your ability to maintain an array of escalating goals for players to aspire towards.</p><p class="calibre_2">However, do not rush the pace of a player's journey. Highlighting end-game content to a beginner will either scare them off (<span class="italic">it's just too much work</span>) or devalue everything else (<span class="italic">this is all a stepping stone to me getting that one thing I really want</span>).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_901"/>


<div id="filepos1039833" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Difficulty</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">This monetization vector is reinforced by the following emotions: mastery (positive) and frustration (negative). By carefully increasing the challenges presented by your in-game tasks (but not the actual complexity of your game mechanics), you're able to create <span class="italic">friction</span>, that is, pre-planned reduction in a player's rate of progression that is designed to encourage players to spend money.</p><p class="calibre_2">Friction can be introduced in the form for difficulty spikes (sections that are much harder than their surroundings) or by steeply increasing the overall difficulty curve at a rate faster than a player's growth in power. Difficulty spikes and rises in difficulty curves are not mutually exclusive, and you can combine both solutions.</p><p class="calibre_2">Once you settle on a method for introducing friction, you can monetize the solutions to the newfound problem by providing:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Band-aids</span> to the temporary problem of a difficulty spike, most likely in the form of consumable goods: premium ammo, powerful boosts, extra moves, lives, and so on</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Long-term solutions</span> that help facilitate a player's growth and progression to match the increasing difficulty: permanent upgrades, powerful items and characters, and so on</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Monetizing difficulty is risky! In some cases, friction can motivate players and keep them going (and potentially spending), but in others, it will cause players to rebel and leave in frustration. Frequent and obvious difficulty spikes will end up feeling jarring and unfair, and the relentlessly growing difficulty curve can tire your audience and make them feel like everything they do is in vain, removing any satisfaction from in-game progression.</p><p class="calibre_2">The consequences of monetizing friction can vary between genres and audiences. Soft launching your game and monitoring the progression, spend, and retention of real players is the best way of analyzing and optimizing your friction.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_903"/>


<div id="filepos1042224" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Playable content</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">This monetization vector is reinforced by the following emotions: curiosity (positive), joy (positive), and boredom (negative). New stories, missions, characters, equipment, environments, and even game modes are all examples of playable content that can be locked behind a <span class="italic">pay-gate</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">To increase the effectiveness of this vector, you'll need to increase the necessity, desirability, and perceived value of your goods, and do it all without pushing the non-paying users out of the game. You can classify your playable content by its lifespan:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Permanent</span>: Game trials, premium expansion packs, and new story episodes have been around for years. Nowadays, we are more likely to get a skeleton of the entire game for free and spend to build up our virtual collections of goods, be it cars, weapons, or heroes. The utility of permanent goods has to be closely planned and monitored. On one hand, satisfying a player's needs permanently removes the chance for repeated sales in that sector of monetization. On the other, making a premium item feel useless and obsolete after 30 minutes will have an equally negative outcome.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Consumable</span>: Satisfying the implementation of non-permanent goods (such as item rentals, game subscriptions, or time-limited access to premium areas) is a great way of maintaining a healthy, long-lasting economy. That said, make sure to diversify your offering! A significant portion of your audience will expect their money to have a long-lasting impact and showcase an inherently adverse reaction to spending on non-permanent content.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_905"/>


<div id="filepos1044174" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Non-playable content</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">This monetization vector is reinforced by the following emotions: pride (positive), amusement (positive), jealousy (negative), and shame (negative). This category includes content and services that may be useful, desirable, and amusing, but do not directly influence or expand a player's gameplay options and capabilities.

What is the age of the average player? People over 25 have more disposable income than teenagers and may be ready to pay for their hobby. Young audiences are very hard to convert and we should actively try to prevent any purchases from minors (for example, by creating an age gate during their first boot-up).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">How much can you get out of your game content?</span>: Is the potential LTV for a D365 player capped at a 100 dollars, or is it 100,000? The former highlights a huge problem if you can't acquire a massive amount of users. The latter is often a sign of being either too optimistic or too stingy.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Is the audience willing to spend?</span>: Are there any preconceptions around your genre or brand that may add value or potentially hurt your offering?: <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">A PC or console brand used in a mobile game will likely aspire to players who are used to spending $60 for a finished product.

Thanks to this effort, our game became a legitimate way to collect digital <span class="italic">Transformers</span> characters, one that requires no shelf space and offers quite a lot for free.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Knowing the basics, you can now adjust your aspirations. For example, a World War II strategy game may lean towards a mature audience and have the content needed to establish a healthy, long-lasting economy. A mobile endless runner, on the other hand, will skew younger players and have a hard time in converting players and extracting revenue without strong upselling techniques. Moreover, if the nature of the game gives little hope for a high D30 retention stat, you might as well try to burn through your content and maximize the ARPPU.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember, it's always good to look at successful games within your genre, but there is no guarantee of translating that success onto a game with a different audience, brand, or scale.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_911"/>

By using a critical vector of progression (described in detail back in the scoping and balancing chapters), you'll be able to model your economy with paying and non-paying players in mind, and better understand the longevity of your content.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's see how this process looks in practice!

This means we give out an extra 1,500 CPs during the first 10 or so hours of gameplay, a meaningful bonus that should help increase engagement and D7 retention without sacrificing longevity of our economy. Players can also grab additional CPs from various performance and engagement-based <span class="italic">medals</span>, but their significance as a source of CPs is minimal.</p><p class="calibre_2">Now that we know how many certs are generated per day, we can better understand that a 1,000 CP weapon requires over a week of highly engaged play for a non-spender, but only 3 semi-engaged days from a high-spender. If our soft-launch data indicates that a lack of variety is hurting retention, then we might want our players to try around 5-10 weapons within their first week . This means we’ll need to make sure to include several 100 CP and 200 CP options in the economy.</p><p class="calibre_2">In <span class="italic">Planetside 2,</span> the control over player progression is given to the players themselves. There are very few requirements in play, and players have the freedom in choosing what to spend their certs on. Free to Play users can spend minimal amounts of CP on unlocking a wide variety of basic weapons and utility perks across the entire game, but thanks to the exponential pricing strategy, the economy still provides ample room for those who wish to dedicate months of gameplay or hundreds of dollars on specialized equipment and heavily-upgraded abilities.</p><p class="calibre_2">To illustrate this with an example, let's look at the CP sink provided by a single weapon on a flying vehicle.

The monetization potential of this particular vehicle is further reinforced by secondary weapons, tools, and a variety of vehicle perks. By all accounts, this looks like an economy with a strong, long-term potential.</p><p class="calibre_2">With CP generation and pricing under wraps, we can set up the relationship between certs and the premium currency. Let’s say that 1,000 CP translates to ~6 hours of playtime, and each hour equals 100 premium currency. By pricing the premium currency at 1 dollar per 100, we can effectively translate the value of a 1,000 CP item into $6. With this information at hand, we can estimate the dollar value of the entire economy. To begin with, upgrading the <span class="italic">M18 Needler</span> alone would cost over $40!</p><p class="calibre_2">While this kind of calculation is hardly scientific and rarely translates into exact dollar value, it helps you in establishing your pricing strategy and understanding the value of your content. Ultimately, it’s up to the players to decide what to spend their time and money on. Most will try to get the things they like for free, some will spend a few dollars for the weapons they like, and others will drop a hundred to treat themselves to a full set of exclusive skins. In the early stages of economy design, the most you can hope for is to create a long-lasting economy, which appears approachable, but encourages spending.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">It's important to note that there are three playable factions in Planetside 2, and veteran players are likely to have multiple characters on their account - each with their own rank and cert balance.

Every gacha model needs to be tailor-made to your game and audience. You may not have the audience, content, or brand required to make your gacha work.</p><p class="calibre_2">To help you better understand and increase the effectiveness of this monetization model, we'll delve into the five pillars of gacha design, and follow them with additional information, tips, and tricks.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_917"/>


<div id="filepos1065974" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Pillar 1 – Quantity and quality</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Since a loot table with ten rewards won't last for long, the very first step in gacha design is to ensure that you have enough content to make gacha a viable monetization strategy.</p><p class="calibre_2">How many unique pieces of content can you offer? You may not know the final quantities, but it important to look at both pessimistic and optimistic estimates. It's best to aim for at least a 100 unique rewards, but it's possible to get away with less, especially if you can make duplicate rewards useful (or even desirable). More on duplicates later!</p><p class="calibre_2">Divide your content into three to five tiers signifying its quality and rarity. Why three to five? Anything below three tends to be too shallow, and anything above five tends to be too fragmented and confusing. Find suitable names for the tiers (common, uncommon, rare, epic, and so on), or mark them with symbols (such as stars), or grades (D, C, B, A, S). When it comes to naming and color-coding your content tiers, do not try to reinvent the wheel; the higher the chance some players are familiar with parts of the system, the better.</p><p class="calibre_2">Speaking of tiers, they are a great way of multiplying your content and expanding your gacha offering. All you need to do is create several versions of the same character/weapon/vehicle (often with the same exact same art and gameplay), but with different starting stats and progression curves. In this way, 40 unique elements can become 120 entries in your gacha economy. Of course, this process has limits and diminishing returns, but I find that sticking to three or so variants works well without muddying the waters too much.</p><p class="calibre_2">Another way of stretching your rewards is to divide them into pieces, such as asking players to collect 50 fragments/shards/blueprints to unlock an item instead of granting it right away. Be very careful when doing this, as fragmenting rewards delays the payoff and essentially reverses the frequency of content unlocks, as players need to get the same exact gacha reward multiple times to get anything out of the system. As a result, seasoned players (who have accumulated progress on multiple items, over a long time) have a much higher chance of receiving something new than the newcomers (who have little hope of actually unlocking something valuable early on). If you decide on using fragmented rewards, it’s best to provide a healthy stream of new content early on, maintaining gameplay variety and keeping players on the optimal path of progression.</p><p class="calibre_2">After you establish how much content you have to offer and how it’s distributed, you have to analyze the speed and price of burning through it. Start by adding up your content and extracting two numbers: the minimum amount of reward drops needed to unlock all available content, and the total drops needed to unlock and upgrade everything. Now, estimate the number of boxes opened per day by different types of player (non-spenders, spenders, and heavy spenders). Using these numbers, you can estimate how long it will take to extinguish your gacha economy, and how much money it will take if you were to accelerate it.</p><p class="calibre_2">To get a more realistic estimation, try restricting the content to an amount that will satisfy most players. After all, there may be 300 unique weapons in the game, but you may actively use just a few at a time, and your needs may be entirely satisfied with a set of five, heavily upgraded ones. With this point, we segue into the next pillar of gacha design.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_919"/>


<div id="filepos1069899" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Pillar 2 – Player capacity</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The long-term appeal of your content is connected to the size of a player's loadout and the utility of growing one's collection.<br class="calibre1"/> Imagine a game where players collect various hero characters, but can only take a single one into battle. This will likely create situations where players become completely satisfied with just a few high-class characters, reducing the appeal of unacquired content dramatically.</p><p class="calibre_2">To keep gacha relevant, you'll need to constantly encourage players to expand their collections. There are few ways of doing that:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Introduce special game modes or missions, which require a particular set of characters or equipment</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Implement unit cooldowns (penalty for repeated use) or daily bonuses (a more positive take) to encourage interaction with a wider palette of content</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Create counter-strategies in your metagame balance, and consider more explicit, capacity-expanding mechanics such as elemental strengths and weaknesses</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">If you come to rely on selling equipment, break it down into multiple pieces (helmet, chest, gloves, shoes, and so on), and maybe even add a few extra rings and trinkets</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Regardless of the solution you go for, your main objective is to protect the longevity of the economy. Ensure that the appetite for new gacha content cannot be quenched by a few lucky pulls!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_921"/>


<div id="filepos1071726" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Pillar 3 – Desirability</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Is your gacha content desirable? Can you imagine spending $10 on it? How about $10,000? Strong, recognizable brands will help raise the value of your virtual collections, but ultimately, the success of your gacha often depends on utility. It's best if you can make your gacha content an essential element of player progression. Completing an in-game collection should be hard, and upgrading it to its full potential should be near-impossible.</p><p class="calibre_2">As for cosmetic content, cheap texture swaps may get you part of the way, but players can often tell if you made the effort or not. Take the time to make the premium cosmetics truly outstanding. Go beyond textures and models, and into particle effects, animations, sound effects, and icons.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_923"/>


<div id="filepos1072714" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Pillar 4 – Sustainability</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Releasing your game with a decent amount of gacha content is one thing, but sustaining it for many years to come is another (especially with a smaller, leaner team). If it takes you two months to make a new character, but you need to release at least one character per month to maintain healthy monetization, you're heading into trouble.</p><p class="calibre_2">This is why you must regularly evaluate your content creation capacity and look for ways to optimize the pipeline, be it with tools, processes, training, or outsourcing. The ultimate goal is to turn content creation into a pleasant and risk-free endeavor.</p><p class="calibre_2">To further reduce the stress of live operations, hold back some of your initial line up and try to establish a backlog of unreleased content. A safety net of at least a month (and ideally three months) will prove essential for all the unforeseen issues that are almost sure to sprout up.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_925"/>


<div id="filepos1073896" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Pillar 5 – Duplicate handling</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Allowing for duplicate rewards is often essential to maintaining longevity and stretching your content. Unfortunately, receiving dupes repeatedly can make spending money a downright infuriating experience. It also creates a negative feedback loop where spending money lowers the chances of receiving a valuable reward; hardly an ideal scenario.</p><p class="calibre_2">To alleviate the problem of meaningless duplicates, we need to create a set of secondary rewards, which are granted for duplicates. These often take form of crafting materials that can be exchanged for rewards of higher rarity. The ultimate goal is to maintain the value of gacha by ensuring that each individual pull is a step towards building up one’s collection and accessing more desirable content. Let’s look at a couple of interesting examples of successful duplicate handling.</p><p class="calibre_2">To start with, we have <span class="italic">Hearthstone’s</span> dust system. This collectible card game sells cards in packs of seven, and even with hundreds of cards at hand, duplicates are a very frequent occurrence. However, only two copies of the same card can be used in any deck (one for legendary cards). This renders the third copy of each card effectively useless. Fortunately, any spare or unwanted cards can be disenchanted in exchange for magical dust; the higher the rarity of the card, the more dust you get. A legendary card will net you 400 dust; gather 1,200 more and you’ll be able to afford any legendary card you want! By returning between 5% and 25% of a card’s value back to the player, and allowing them to pick the card they want to create, <span class="italic">Hearthstone</span> has created a very effective and player-friendly system.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Clash Royale</span>, on the other hand, treats its cards differently. Premium chests are chock-full of cards, with over 300 cards in a single <span class="italic">Giant Chest</span>. At the time of writing, there are only around 70 unique cards in the economy, and getting a new type of card is not a frequent occurrence for the player. Therefore, at a first glance, there seems to be an issue of flooding players with a massive amount of duplicates. However, in <span class="italic">Clash Royale</span>, unlocking a new card is just the beginning! Upgrading cards is the primary means of player progression, and it can only be done via duplicate copies of each individual card. And it takes quite a lot of copies, too… Upgrading an epic card to its limit takes over 386 duplicates, while a common, on the other hand, requires a total of 9,586 copies of the same card! With duplicate-driven economy in place, the cards in <span class="italic">Clash Royale</span> maintain their value for many months:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00079.jpg" class="calibre_104"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Clash Royale chests are chock-full of card stacks and interesting mechanics. In this case, you can select between different card types as you open the box!</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">There are many more examples of duplicate handling, but the key lesson is one of maintaining or even reinforcing the long-term effectiveness of your gacha boxes.</p><p class="calibre_2">It's true that the 100<sup class="calibre10"><small class="calibre11"><span class="calibre12">th</span></small></sup> pull a premium gacha will never be as rewarding as the first couple—full of new, exciting rewards, and endless potential. But it's important we do what we can to maintain the value proposition for as long as possible!</p><p class="calibre_2">Now that we're finished with the 5 pillars of gacha design, let's take a look at some further tips and insights on the subject!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_927"/>


<div id="filepos1077907" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Weight-based loot tables</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">As players, we often think of probability in games as flat percentages—this action has a 5% chance of success, that item has a 20% chance to drop, and so on, but assigning actual percentage values to rewards is a very problematic and ultimately futile endeavor. After all, adding a single new reward may require modifications to the entire loot table. Let’s look at a simple example!</p><p class="calibre_2">In a loot table of 5 items, we have 4 common rewards and 1 rare reward, which we want to be 10 times harder to get. Calculating the exact percentage value for our rare item is not an easy task, unless we use weights, in which case it becomes trivial.</p><p class="calibre_2">In our weighted probability system, each item is assigned a number, which represents its relationship to other items. An item with a weight of 250 is 25 times more likely to drop than an item with a weight of 10. To get a percentage chance, we simply divide the weight of one item by the total weight of the entire loot table:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><table valign="top" class="calibre_120"><tr valign="top" class="calibre_121"><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">  <span class="bold">Item</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">  <span class="bold">Weight</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">  <span class="bold">Percentage</span></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_121"><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">A  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">10  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">10/41 = 0.2439 = 24.4%  </p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_121"><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">B  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">10  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">10/41 = 24.4%  </p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_121"><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">C  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">10  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">10/41 = 24.4%  </p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_121"><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">D  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">10  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">10/41 = 24.4%  </p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_121"><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">E (rare)  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">1  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">1/41 = 0.024 = 2.4%  </p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre_121"><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">Total  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">41  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre_122">   <p class="calibre_2">100%  </p></td></tr></table><p class="calibre_2">By adding more items into the table, we automatically lower the chances of other items. An empty reward entry with a weight of 500 would make all rewards more scarce by reducing the chances of getting any item at all.</p><p class="calibre_2">We can also nest reward sets together. Our A, B, C, D, and E items could all contain further reward sets with weights of their own, which is exactly how most gacha loot tables operate. You may have a static 10% chance to get a rare item, but the rare reward set itself may contain dozens of entries with varying degrees of probability.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_929"/>


<div id="filepos1082187" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Packaging and opening</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Gacha is not just about the reward, it's about the entire experience of receiving it. The design of your packaging and opening sequences can have a big influence on your financial performance.</p><p class="calibre_2">How do you envision your gacha? Is it a pack of cards that fans out in front of the player? Is it a magical crystal that bursts in a pillar of light? An egg that has to be cracked? A box bursting with treasures? Make sure to set aside ample time to implement and polish both the gacha packaging and the opening experience.</p><p class="calibre_2">Delivering a good gacha opening experience is a dual faceted challenge. To start with, you want to build anticipation, raise the expectations by improving the sequence for higher reward tiers, and culminate in a celebratory reveal. On the other hand, you need to be efficient and build a sequence that isn't overly long and annoying when seen for a hundredth (or thousandth) time.</p><p class="calibre_2">If you do your job particularly well, you will have players who try to open 100 boxes in a row. Make sure that doing so is neither problematic nor boring. By implementing an <span class="italic">Open 10 option</span> for your reward boxes, you can streamline the opening experience without completely devoiding it of its charm.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">When offering multiple rewards from a single gacha pull, it's wise to implement a guarantee of some sort. For example, Hearthstone's pack of 7 cards contains at least 1 card that's rare or better. Such a guarantee increases the perceived value and offsets the risk of bad luck on the player's part. But remember, guaranteed rewards may inflate your value proposition and might require you to lower the average quality of remaining rewards.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_931"/>


<div id="filepos1084297" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Maintaining consistency</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">You want your customers to easily decide between different types of reward boxes based on their theme and contents alone. Constantly shifting the percentage chances for different reward tier chances and introducing ambiguous value propositions will lead to confusion and discourage players from spending.</p><p class="calibre_2">Set up rules around the distribution of reward tiers inside your premium gacha boxes (for example, a 2%/12%/86% split between legendary/rare/common items) and stick to them! Inconsistent tiers will not only make your life harder (more variables to set up and balance), but they'll also make for less satisfied customers.</p><p class="calibre_2">With consistent offering, a player who wants a new warrior class character can instantly choose a Warrior Box over a Gunner Box without second-guessing themselves. After all, the chances of getting a legendary character are the same in every premium box. The decision comes down to what I want to spend on, and the value itself never comes into question.</p><p class="calibre_2">Loot box consistency does not mean you cannot have scarce rewards within a certain rarity tier (for example, a common character that's much less likely to drop than other commons), nor does it prohibit free boxes with different reward tiers, or boxes that guarantee a certain tier. It’s all about ensuring that a certain class of premium box offers consistent reward tiers across the entire game, even if the loot tables themselves differ in contents.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_933"/>


<div id="filepos1086072" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Kompu gacha</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Kompu or complete gacha refers to a practice of compounding multiple randomized prizes into <span class="bold">powerful sets</span> (which can be extremely hard to complete). For example, imagine an armor set that comprises of 6 pieces (3 common, 2 rare, and 1 legendary -with an incredibly small drop chance). Thanks to a <span class="italic">set bonus</span> (for having all 6 pieces), the power of a complete set is much greater than the sum of its individual parts.</p><p class="calibre_2">By diminishing the value of base components and making the ever-elusive grand prize the ultimate goal of spending money, the model has turned an already popular gacha model into something even more lucrative, but not for long...</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">In 2012, Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency declared that the disproportionate gap between risk and reward in kompu gacha models puts them dangerously close to gambling, and subsequently banned the use of kompu gacha in Japan. As for the legal status of gacha (be it kompu or otherwise) in the Western market, as of April 2018, we do not have any major restrictions, but it's best to track current legislation, avoid randomized rewards that can be taken out of the game (can be perceived as gambling), and try to protect minors from exposure to paid gacha content.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">If you plan on creating sets of loot box rewards and avoid falling into the Kompu gacha category, try to observe the following rules:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Set components have value on their own, outside the context of the complete set</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Individual pieces are not deceptively rare in comparison to everything else</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">The complete set is seen as a bonus, and not the sole purpose of that entire offering</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_935"/>


<div id="filepos1088255" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Box gacha</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">As in normal gacha, the rewards from box gacha come from a randomized loot table, but with one big design change. The box contents are finite and each reward can only be pulled once. If there are 20 items on the loot table, they will all be distributed within exactly 20 pulls, and even if one item has a tiny 0.1% chance of dropping, you can be certain that, in the worst case scenario, you’ll only need to pull the other 19 items before receiving your grand reward.</p><p class="calibre_2">The mechanics of box gacha bring a great level of comfort to the players, and make it the perfect solution for parts of the economy that have a fixed number of duplicates, or wherever a duplicate would be deemed inappropriate. For example, imagine that your players have to spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars for a chance of grabbing a box with one of five legendary artifacts. A duplicate, in this case, would not only be inappropriate, but also infuriate the most valuable players.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_937"/>


<div id="filepos1089461" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Bundles and targeting</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The more steps you put between players and the content they desire, the higher the chance they'll stop part way in the process. The purchase flow in most online games is a multi-step adventure that's not very user-friendly at all, since our players usually have to:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Identify something they need</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Check how much currency is required</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Navigate to the premium currency shop</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Decide between different packages, bundles, and offers</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Complete the purchase of the premium currency</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Go back and spend their new resources on the item</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">In this example, we are assuming that players need to purchase premium currency since very few users stockpile on premiums without a clear spending goal in mind. Now, vast improvements to the flow can be made by simply directing players towards the exact currency pack they need once they attempt to purchase the item (thus effectively removing steps 2, 3, and 4). However, not everyone attempts to purchase something they clearly can’t afford in the first place, and so the long shop funnel (along with its many drop-off points) lives on.</p><p class="calibre_2">Can we make things simpler? The bright minds at <span class="italic">Valve</span> suggest that developers use real money purchases across the entire game economy, that is, to remove the proxy of premium currency. This might be a solution for you, but many game economies still put an important role onto premium currencies. After all, they are great for tiny, incremental purchases (such as time skips), which can be given out in controlled amounts, and are an elegant way of letting players decide what kind of reward they want.</p><p class="calibre_2">What if we packed our content into bundles and sold it directly (for real money) to the receptive user base? The short answer: it works. The long answer: themed content bundles at accessible price points are one of the most effective sales techniques in Free to Play video games.</p><p class="calibre_2">There is no simple answer as to what you should put in your bundles; after all, every game economy is different. But there are a few guidelines to follow:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Timing matters</span>: Bundles are more effective if they are time-limited and receive the exposure caused by engaging events.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Less is more</span>: Do not spam your players or flood them with different options. Give them a few different bundles to pick from, and they’ll be able to make up their mind in seconds. Give them fifteen bundles with varying themes and price points, and they’ll very likely be paralyzed by the sheer quantity of choices and the fear of picking a sub-optimal offering.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Do not put excessive amounts of premium currency in your bundles and sales</span>: Doing so will lead to players stockpiling on premiums, sitting on it for weeks, and spending it all at once on new game content. Bulk purchases of this kind tend to be a disappointing experience for the user and further shorten the lifespan of your content.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Do not discount heavily and maintain a steady Expected Value (EV)</span>: You'll find all the information on using and calculating EV in the following section. As for the discounts, the likes of Black Friday may be a good excuse to put on a lot of quality content for sale, but it doesn't require that you devalue it. Try to prevent your offerings from ever going more than 30-40% off. The only exception for insane deals are highly limited (one per user) starter bundles.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Want before need</span>: I may need more fuel, but what I really want is a new car. Look at usage and purchase data to determine the most desirable content and shortlist it for your most important bundles. Avoid diminishing returns by intertwining less desirable offers at off-peak times (in days with lower DAU), and try not to use your best content back-to-back.</li></ol><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="6" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Targeting is everything</span>: Thanks to machine learning and automatic bundle targeting, it's possible to customize your offerings towards individual players based on their spending pattern and current game state. If you're in no position to deploy such tools, then you can always fall back on manually creating a series of bundles and toggle them based on several profile requirements such as player level, already unlocked content, and past spending (more on that later on).</li></ol><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_939"/>


<div id="filepos1094666" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Utilizing EV in bundle creation</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Are your bundles comparably attractive? Are you giving away too much content for too little money? The EV is a simple calculation that helps compare your premium offerings and understand the percentage gain (or loss) of value between them. This is best explained with a simple example.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's say your premium currency store offers 100 premium currency for $4, and that a value of a rare character is estimated at 500 premium currency ($20). A special bundle with 200 premium and 2 rare characters is therefore worth an estimated $48. If you were to put this bundle on sale for $29.99, you'd create an offering with an EV of 160% (48 ÷ 29.99 = 1.6), a 60% growth in value when compared to your baseline offering. This is a good deal, but is it too good of a deal? That depends on the average lifespan of your players. If the game is designed to support a year-long player progression, you might want to keep the EVs within 100 and 160 percent. However, if players are easy to acquire but the very nature of your game makes it hard to retain them for more than a few weeks, the EVs could in theory go up to 200%.</p><p class="calibre_2">Pay close attention to the EVs of all premium goods and don't think of the EV as something you put up or down to sell more stuff. The ultimate objective is to maintain a stable offering across the entire lifespan of your game, with a few exceptions reserved for the likes of highly limited goods such as anniversary sales or starter bundles. Stable EV prevents inflation of your economy and saves your customers the effort (and anxiety) of having to constantly evaluate and calculate your offers in search of good and bad deals.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_941"/>


<div id="filepos1096611" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Adjusting your offering based on individual player spending</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">If you have a player who is willing to spend $10 but is offered a $5 bundle, you're potentially leaving $5 on the table. Likewise, if your player is looking for a $1 or $2 transaction and you're flashing $50 and $100 offers in their face, the monetization potential dwindles, and you may even evoke a cynical response to your offerings.</p><p class="calibre_2">We need to make it easy for our players to support the game and consume the content we've crafted for them. To help us cater to player preferences, we need to discover <span class="bold">what</span>
<span class="bold">each user wants to spend on, and how much</span>. At first, you’ll need to cast your net wide. Present a few extremes and adjust the future offers based on the purchasing pattern. Let’s say a user is given a choice between $4.99 and $49.99 versions of the same bundle (that is, the same content but in different quantities). If they go for $4.99, we should try to monetize at $9.99 and $19.99 next. Should they go for $49.99, we are given a signal that a $99.99 offer may be approached with enthusiasm.</p><p class="calibre_2">This kind of targeting is fertile ground for machine learning algorithms, but huge progress can be made by putting a simple set of requirements based on the last 5 purchases and the top price tier ever achieved. Just make sure to not put a user in the high-spending corner and cut them off from smaller offerings permanently just because they made a once-in-a-blue-moon purchase for their birthday.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_943"/>


<div id="filepos1098366" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Purchase rationalization</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Be it culturally or genetically, we are predisposed towards dedicating a large portion of our day to gathering and protecting our resources. For any adult who appreciates the value and purchasing power of money, spending it can be a highly complex behavior. Our decisions originate as emotional and visceral reactions, which are then rationalized before execution.</p><p class="calibre_2">By acknowledging and embracing the differences in spending habits and patterns, you can consciously expand your offering and cater to a wider portion of your player base. Let's explore a list of common emotional contexts and internal rationalizations used to enable spending:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Curiosity</span>: I really want to find out how this works or what’s going to happen next.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Necessity</span>: I need to purchase this to play the way I want to play.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Exclusivity</span>: There is simply no way I can get this now other than paying, so I might as well spend.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Opportunity</span>: I don't want to miss out on this deal.

With a VIP program or premium subscription, the sooner I start, the better. This is even more appealing if the rewards scale and grow with my progress.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Permanent value</span>: I don't want to feel like I have to keep spending repeatedly, but if a single purchase can get me 50% more XP and coins for life, I'm on board!</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Peer pressure</span>: My friends have all purchased this boost, and I feel like I should give back and contribute too.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Consumer behavior</span>: A lot of people seem to enjoy this and say it's good, I guess I can give it a try too!</li><li value="9" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Recognition</span>: This thing will bring me respect and popularity!</li><li value="10" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Altruism</span>: I can provide benefits to my friends and contribute to the community I care about!</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_945"/>


<div id="filepos1100910" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Evaluate your audience!</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Spending behaviors are often influenced by cultural differences. To provide an example based on my colleague's many years of experience, American players tend to be more impulsive and lacking in self control, but are also quick to write customer support tickets if they’re not fully satisfied. German players, on the other hand, tend to be very analytical, they do their math, internalize their decision, and often blame themselves if they’re not happy with their choice. Evaluate the target demographic when planning your monetization strategy; what works in one region won’t necessarily translate elsewhere!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_947"/>


<div id="filepos1101734" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Players have limited budgets</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Most players have a set amount of money they are willing to spend on gaming in a set period (usually monthly because of paycheck cycles). It's best if players spend consistently over the month, getting small rewards for each individual action. Releasing a high amount of highly desirable content back-to-back will force the players to quickly use up their limit or even go past it. Both of these outcomes are not going to help you sustain the game or your spenders. Should they spend their whole mental cash allocation on the first day of the month, the rest of it may feel very disappointing and bleak in comparison. Similarly, if we put a lot of great content on sale, we'll force some players to spend more than they planned to. Players who overspend are likely to feel angry at the developer, not at their own lack of self control.</p><p class="calibre_2">To sum things up, spender behavior can vary from highly logical to completely irrational. We need to expand our offering to appeal to a variety of spending patterns and rationalizations, and control the release cadence to prevent overspending.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_949"/>

This could be a public beta, Steam early access, or a so-called soft launch (low-key deployment in a few handpicked territories, for example, Australia, Netherlands, Canada, or the Philippines).</p><p class="calibre_2">The success of any live title depends on the publisher's ability to double down on their investment and maintain a dedicated team to execute on the key aspects of liveops:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Content and feature updates</span>: Keeping the game feeling fresh, bug-free, and relevant</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Balancing improvements</span>: Addressing both dominant and underplayed strategies based on analytics and player sentiment</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Customer support</span>: Creating and policing your in-game and online community, and sharing customer sentiments, suggestions, and feedback with the game team</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Paid marketing and social campaigns</span>: To profitably grow, maintain, and re-engage your user base</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Events, bundles, and sales</span>: Increasing engagement and monetization in a sustainable way</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">To deliver on this level of support, the development team will need to plan and prepare for live operations in weeks or months before launch. The list of tasks, among other things, includes:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Planning a few months of events, content, and feature rollouts</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Creating and deploying liveops tools to handle sales, events, and customer support</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Preparing the game code for frequent updates, handling live configs, asset streaming</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Securing the servers and testing the ability to scale them with growing CCU</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Implementing analytics, deep-linking, and marketing tracking tools</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Creating a live marketing strategy and social media content</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">Assembling and training the customer support staff</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">The duration of live support will depend on the success of the game and your team's capabilities. Even if you don't have the resources to create new content and features for more than several months, you should still try and keep your servers going for as long as possible. A minimal level of support a few years into the product's life will help create trust in your products and validate any investment in your virtual worlds.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_951"/>


<div id="filepos1106369" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Staffing</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Even after the busiest production period is wrapped up and the game is ready for the full launch, the team size is unlikely to go down. You might be able to release some of the programming, art, and QA staff, but the core development team often has to stay and continue working on new content and updates. Meanwhile, a whole range of support roles enter the picture!</p><p class="calibre_2">Let’s break down a few key roles involved in preparing live games for launch and maintaining them during the live operations period. Depending on your team's composition and capabilities, you may need to distribute some of these responsibilities across any available team members:</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Live operations manager</span><br class="calibre1"/> Responsible for planning, designing, and integrating special events, bundles, and in-game sales. Live operations managers are responsible for engaging users, maximizing the financial performance of their games, and simultaneously safeguarding their economies from inflation and excessive content devaluation.</p><p class="calibre_2">Medium scale mobile games are usually run with 1 to 4 live ops staff, depending on the complexity of the game and the effectiveness of the available tool set. In teams without a dedicated live ops person, it's likely that the game designer will assume these responsibilities, sometimes at the cost of distracting time and attention from creating and balancing new game content.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Data analyst</span><br class="calibre1"/> Throughout a game's production, data analysts and engineers design and integrate analytics solutions that track a wide variety of in-game events from retention, revenue, and session data, to player progression, failure rates, item usage, player inventory size, and even the effectiveness of your marketing (by monitoring the retention of users coming into the game from links embedded into marketing campaigns).</p><p class="calibre_2">But even the most comprehensive usage data is as valuable as your ability to parse it and turn it into actionable feedback. Data analysts compose dashboards, reports, and detailed investigations into trends and player behavior. Statistically relevant and impartial data is an invaluable tool, which helps inform balancing changes, improve decision making, and shape the future of the product.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Community and customer support lead</span><br class="calibre1"/> Your customer support team is an important bridge between the development team and the player base. Having the CCS lead embedded within the game team ensures that important issues are easily flagged and resolved before anything gets out of hand.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Marketing manager</span><br class="calibre1"/> Live operations require your marketing staff to constantly analyze, coordinate, and scale paid marketing campaigns according to their performance. They also help manage the external relationships with advertising agencies, brand owners, and platform holders such as Apple and Google.</p><p class="calibre_2">Even though the marketing team itself may consist of many people working on multiple titles at a time, it's often helpful to designate a single owner and point of contact for a particular title.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Social media manager</span><br class="calibre1"/> Growing and retaining a strong social media presence is difficult and time-consuming, but often well worth the effort. Social media managers help to plan, create, and promote engaging content including community votes, game news, photo and video content, and the ever-important live streams.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_953"/>


<div id="filepos1110309" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Efficient live ops</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Unless you've made a runaway success, your management may be eager to reduce the team size and allow for most of the production staff to move onto other game projects and opportunities.</p><p class="calibre_2">This transition will often be done after the game matures (12-24 months after launch) and where there's stable revenue but little prospect for outstanding growth (there are only a few games that can turn into a massive success more than a year after release).</p><p class="calibre_2">With efficient content and event management tools (more on those later) and T-shaping (training the remaining staff to take up a wide range of tasks and responsibilities), you should be able to run a mature title of average complexity and size with just a few, highly empowered people.</p><p class="calibre_2">Even without a single coder on board, the live ops team might be able to keep the game alive with events, game balancing, and even basic content updates (based on re-adapted or outsourced art). As for the customer support staff, their numbers will depend on the number of customers who require assistance on a regular basis.</p><p class="calibre_2">Unfortunately, this is all easier said than done. Creating an efficient live ops machine requires a certain team mentality and preparation, including:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Writing expandable game engines and designing your games to make them as content-driven as possible.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Getting creative people into positions of power (to run their own games), and giving them the tools and autonomy they need to thrive. Let people experiment and push their systems to the limits in order to continually delight players with new content, varied mechanics, and twists on old formulas.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Creating a desire and expectation for automation. You need to recognize the most repetitive tasks and do your best to streamline them. People who use the tools shouldn't expect to have to waste their time.</li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">No matter the size of your live ops team, it's essential to stay organized! Create forms and processes to follow, and always test your content. After several months of recurring events and sales, it will become very tempting to stop updating your planning sheets, skip checklists, and blindly copy/paste data. This will inevitably lead to a gradual decline in the quality of your live operations, and diminished consistency of your offering. It’s fine to improve and streamline your processes to match your evolving needs, but these things are there for a reason; do not leave them behind!</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_955"/>


<div id="filepos1113394" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Live-game balancing</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">As you may remember from previous chapters, the game balancing process is sure to continue after release. Live products provide you with invaluable data, but they also introduce heavy limitations, especially for Free to Play games.</p><p class="calibre_2">Making changes that may affect millions of players is a very delicate act. Players who put significant amounts of time and money into your game are right to expect their content to stay relevant and retain value. Upholding this promise while simultaneously fighting overly-dominant strategies is not easy!:</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Use soft-launch and test-environments to validate balance with real players</span><br class="calibre1"/> Beta tests and soft-launches provide you with time and the opportunity for extensive content balancing, especially since it’s likely that you won’t allow for any spending and may even implement plans to reset the game progress. Moreover, most platform holders (such as Apple, Google, and Steam) can provide you with a clear "beta" or "early-access" badge, which helps to set an expectation that the game is likely to change and evolve.</p><p class="calibre_2">Once you hit global release, you’ll need to slow down. Stagnation may be bad for the long-term health of your game, but it’s far better than going back and forth between rash and uncalibrated changes that infuriate your customers.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Vary your data sources</span><br class="calibre1"/> Before you make any changes, you need to know what to address in the first place. Remember that game balance is subjective and does not rely on a single source of information. Mix the data provided by game analytics with internal feedback, player sentiment, and even questionnaires.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Batch your balancing work</span><br class="calibre1"/> Even the most minor tweaks need extensive validation and testing. Changing the spread of a shotgun from 12 to 11 is rarely a good reason to disrupt your live operations schedule. Daily content changes are time-consuming and hard to keep up with, so unless you're trying to address freshly released content, or find a game breaking issue, you should wait until you assemble a set of prospective issues and deal with them once or twice a month.</p><p class="calibre_2">Batching your changes into bigger releases also gives you an opportunity to manage player sentiment by surrounding negative changes (informally referred to as <span class="italic">nerfs</span>) with positive ones (known as <span class="italic">buffs</span>).</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Make gradual changes and avoid overshooting</span><br class="calibre1"/> Once a hundred people tell you how badly something <span class="italic">sucks</span>, you'll be instinctively driven to show the world that you listen by fixing things quickly and decisively. However, once the game is live, you must do your best to curb this reaction, as the risk of going overboard is huge.</p><p class="calibre_2">It's far better to gradually buff the same strategy three or even four times across two months, than to make it too strong and have to follow up with a nerf.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Nerf by contrast</span><br class="calibre1"/> Although buffing weak content and strategies is often met with great enthusiasm, you must be very careful when making negative changes. Each nerf risks infuriating your players, even to a point of causing a volley of refund requests from dissatisfied customers.</p><p class="calibre_2">That said, just because you need to reduce the stats of an overpowered character or bring down a dominant strategy does not mean you have to do it explicitly. By introducing new counter-strategies or reinforcing existing ones, you can often restore the balance without resorting to direct downgrades. Remember, context is everything; if you can't bring something down, raise everything around it!</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Communicate your intentions as far ahead as you can</span><br class="calibre1"/> An information vacuum breeds rumors and propagates negative sentiments. Try to maintain a two-way communication channel with the community and aim to address any big issues before they escalate. Explain the rationale, share the thinking process, or even part of the analytics data to support your decisions. Utilize a range of tools to address as many players as possible, from in-game news feeds, patch notes, and official wikis, to social media and live-streaming.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Shifting meta can revitalize your economy</span><br class="calibre1"/> Your players are an active component of any multiplayer game and the decisions they make can have a great effect on other players, and by extension, on the overall balance of the game. Tactical adjustments and reactions to strategies exhibited by other players (as well as so-called <span class="italic">mind games</span>) are the building blocks of your <span class="italic">meta</span>. The significance and extensiveness of the meta layer varies across games, and often comes down to the knowledge of, and preference for certain card decks, weapon loadouts, building layouts, character rosters, and tactics.</p><p class="calibre_2">The in-game community at large is constantly evolving the meta by re-evaluating the trends and strategies of other players. Some players expend considerable effort to optimize against the most prolific and successful ones, while others stick to what they like or know best.</p><p class="calibre_2">Game designers can affect and revitalize (shift) the meta by introducing and incentivizing new strategies and slowly sunsetting (countering) the dominant ones.</p><p class="calibre_2">On top of making the game more interesting, meta shifting can be a great way of increasing the value of existing content, which wasn't desirable in the <span class="italic">old meta</span>. By shifting the desire and attention to other elements of the economy, you can also stop a portion of your content from getting overly saturated.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_957"/>


<div id="filepos1119697" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Planning</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">To have any hopes of delivering on your live operations promise, you’ll need to plan well ahead. A few months before the game's global release, you should be able to agree on:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Content and live ops features (such as events) required for the game's launch. This consists of your liveops MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and should include the content reserved for the first several weeks of live operations.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">The liveops calendar spanning the first few months. More on the calendar in the following section!</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Content production pipeline for the first few months of live operations.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Live ops features and improvements required in the first few months.</li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">The first few months after global release are as exciting as they are stressful. It's essential to figure out what content matters, and what barely moves the needle. Avoid cutting corners in the hope of turning a quick buck. Do not act on inconclusive data and knee-jerk yourself into trouble. Live games take time to stabilize, and any decisions you make in a rush may end up undermining the game's future.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">The first few months of live operations may be rough, but if all goes well, you'll end up creating a well-oiled machine that is set up to succeed for the years to come. The better your processes and plans, the less likely you are to have to <span class="italic">put out fires</span> on a Sunday afternoon.</p><p class="calibre_2">Extend the agile development process into live operations! If you're using Jira, or any similar agile tool, try creating a separate <span class="italic">ticket dashboard</span> for live ops and break down each content update into executable and testable tasks.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_959"/>


<div id="filepos1121901" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Live ops calendar</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A live ops calendar tracks everything that's happening in your game and provides an essential insight into the past and future of your live operations. In <span class="italic">Transformers: Earth Wars</span>, it took the form of a long (but tidy) Google sheet, with each day taking a single row. The rows were populated with the following information:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Versions of the game client (the actual application installed by the players) and game content (config) across different platforms and environments. It's important to make sure that the game client containing new features or content will be ready for its corresponding event.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Major real-world events (such as holidays) and in-game affairs (new storylines, game feature releases, and so on).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Special event information including the name and type of the event, main reward, and start and end dates. More on events later on!</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Sale dates for premium bundles and content. This allows us to easily find out the last time we sold a particular bundle or character.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Important notes on game economy updates such as new characters entering the gacha pool.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Newsfeed tracking, that is, which in-game news is live and for how long.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">When it comes to releasing new content, it's best to establish a steady, predictable pace. In the case of <span class="italic">Transformers</span>, a single character per month was much better than a set of three characters in a span of a few weeks followed by a two-month break.</p><p class="calibre_2">Be very careful to not fire your shells all at once! Setting a release schedule that you cannot sustain will not only increase the pressure on the team, but also inevitably end up creating an impression that the game is <span class="italic">slowing down</span> and becoming less eventful, thus lowering the trust in its future.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Creating news feeds, preparing events, and implementing new bundles and content takes a lot of time. Use any spare resources, outsourcing, and quiet moments to get ahead with your live ops. Being a few months ahead with game assets and a few weeks with game config gives you the necessary peace of mind, safeguards your operations, and allows members of staff to take a holiday.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_961"/>


<div id="filepos1124715" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Release cadence</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The release cycles for your game client (the application you install) and content (config delivered via an internet connection) vary between products and platforms. At <span class="italic">Space Ape Games</span>, we usually release major content updates on Wednesday or Thursday (ahead of weekend events) and optionally on Monday. Client updates themselves are released at least a few days earlier, with new content and features turned off. The staggered release pattern gives players a few days to update their game without being immediately blocked from playing. It also takes into account the time we need to secure App Store approval.</p><p class="calibre_2">No matter what release cadence you go for, it's best to reserve a full day to finding and reacting to any live issues. Avoiding Friday releases gives you a good chance to preserve your weekend.</p><p class="calibre_2">However, it's still necessary to create an on-call roster and designate people to periodically monitor the game's dashboards and inform the team of any issues. After all, if we want to provide a great service to our players, we have to try and keep the game running smoothly and without major disruptions.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_963"/>


<div id="filepos1126121" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Tools and setup</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Even the best live ops teams will have a hard time running their game without the help of efficient tooling and a bullet-proof infrastructure. Let's run through the basics:</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">CMS (Content Management System)</span><br class="calibre1"/> CMS encapsulates any tooling that empowers designers, live ops managers, and any other non-programmers to create, change, and deploy game content.</p><p class="calibre_2">From game and level editors, to bespoke configuration tools, config files, and online spreadsheets - the fate of your CMS will depend on your game engine and data architecture. Live ops tooling cannot be an afterthought, so make sure to communicate your content management intentions early and request any tools you may need throughout production.</p><p class="calibre_2">With a well-integrated content management system, editing files is quick, error-free, and well-visualized. Moreover, deploying new balancing tweaks, levels, missions, events, localization files, items, and so on should be done in CMS alone and require no new game code.</p><p class="calibre_2">New graphical assets may still need an updated game client (until you integrate an asset streaming solution), but balancing tweaks that modify the damage of a <span class="italic">War Axe</span> from 18 to 15 should never require a new game version. If this isn’t the case for your game, your iteration time, bug fixing capability, and live ops flexibility will suffer greatly!</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">CRM (Customer Relationship Management)</span><br class="calibre1"/> Logging and tracking support tickets means nothing if your customer support team has no way of addressing them. It's essential to have a CRM portal that empowers your team and allows them to monitor, and if necessary, edit player profiles.</p><p class="calibre_2">The most common use cases include handing out bans and warnings, recovering lost accounts, changing in-game names, sending compensating gifts, and resolving user-specific issues.</p><p class="calibre_2">At <span class="italic">Space Ape Games</span>, CRM tools are highly customized for each game, but many companies integrate their entire customer support operations under an umbrella of a single tool such as Desk.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Dashboards</span><br class="calibre1"/> Your analytics are only as powerful as your ability to parse data and quickly react to issues and abnormalities. It's a common practice to compose a live dashboard of the most important KPIs and put them on display in an accessible part of the office. After all, if the team is supposed to feel responsible for the game, they need easy access to information about its current performance. Following links to online dashboards every few hours requires active interest, and catching a glimpse every time you stand from your seat is a much more accessible affair.</p><p class="calibre_2">As for anyone who's not fully embedded within the game team (or responsible for keeping the service live), automatic daily and weekly reports should be sufficient.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Test environments</span><br class="calibre1"/> The best way of testing client, server, and config updates is to deploy them onto a game environment with actual players. However, the last thing you want is to expose paying customers to untested code and potentially game-breaking issues. To address this conundrum, your server developers and development operations staff will need to establish a range of test environments. From tiny servers for internal use only, to public test realms (PTRs) populated by real players.</p><p class="calibre_2">At <span class="italic">Space Ape Games</span>, we often deploy our game updates a few days early onto a single, ring-fenced territory (such as Thailand or the Philippines), where a different version of the game is released. The game in our test market is virtually the same, but contains no in-app purchases (thus removing the risk of hurting paying customers), and its players are separated from the rest of the world. As a result, any issues we weren’t able to identify during our internal tests can come to light without damaging the entire game. On a side note, some players really enjoy trying out and giving feedback on new features before they're live for everyone else.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Live ops tools</span><br class="calibre1"/> It's best if your live operations managers can spend most of their time designing engaging events and effective sales strategies, not inputting data by hand. Live ops tools often take the shape of bespoke online portals where one can easily set up and schedule events, bundles, newsfeeds, and notifications. In the best case scenario, you should be able to easily create templates and base new entries on previously used ones.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Asset streaming</span><br class="calibre1"/> When it comes to mobile platforms, the more content you can deliver without updating the game client and going through the submission process, the better. Moreover, Apple and Google both put a limit on the size of the apps and updates that can be delivered over mobile networks (which helps to preserve a user's bandwidth).</p><p class="calibre_2">By implementing an asset streaming solution, we can keep the initial download size of the game under wraps and deliver the game client without the need for WiFi. And although long asset downloads during the very first loading seem far worse than having to download the entire game on WiFi, based on a few experiments at <span class="italic">Space Ape Games</span>, it's been proven that the D1 retention is higher if the game client is kept small.</p><p class="calibre_2">On a side note, small app size also means that potential players can instantly act upon any digital advert for our game. Advertising to people who simply cannot download the game because they are not on WiFi can be a huge waste of money. It's possible to restrict our campaigns to only target WiFi users, but such a strategy would decrease your reach and increase your costs.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_965"/>


<div id="filepos1132529" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Events</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Events are special, time-limited activities designed to provide variety, increase player engagement, and potentially encourage spending. Events come in all shapes and sizes, from leaderboard competitions and tournaments, to double XP weekends, Black Friday deals, special maps, and game modes.</p><p class="calibre_2">The scope of your events will depend on your ambitions, capabilities, and the importance of the period in question. Some events require extensive planning and new content (it's common to theme a large portion of a game's assets after the Olympics, Christmas, or Halloween), while others can be done on a whim and rely on an established event pattern, a few banners, and a selection of available content.</p><p class="calibre_2">Before you design and implement any event system, you'll have to think of a few potential use cases. For each example you can think of, answer the following questions:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">What's the primary objective of the event? Engagement, the reactivation of lapsed users, revenue generation, and so on?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Who will interact with the system? Is it targeted at individuals or groups? Casual or competitive players? What’s your desired engagement rate?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">How will the event be delivered, presented, and promoted?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Can players opt into event gameplay when they like, or are they racing against the clock and one another?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">What are the rewards for participation?</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Well-designed event systems are made up of a variety of components (such as time limits, leaderboards, and score targets) that can be reused and combined in different permutations.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_967"/>


<div id="filepos1134629" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Event classification</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The size and reach of your events has a strong effect on player behavior. A 24-hour long individual tournament feels completely different from a month long faction undertaking. Let's look at a few examples and what they entail:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Individual events</span>: It's just me against the world! Special missions, individual tournaments, and leaderboards can be very appealing and encourage players to return and engage at set times and in set ways. Just make sure to protect weaker and less experienced players against the ultra-competitive elite.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Group vs Group</span>: Few things are as effective in building bonds between players as guild wars, alliance leaderboards, boss raids, and group tournaments. As always, stay vigilant and monitor the effect of various events on your community. Interactions between passionate groups and peer pressure within them can easily turn from fun and engaging to discouraging and toxic.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Server-wide events</span>: Massive undertakings to unlock a game feature or reward on a server-wide scale can be very appealing and encourage lapsed players to return. However, since no one feels particularly responsible or compelled to work extra-hard for a server-wide outcome, you'll need to make sure to recognize and reward individual or guild-based contributions.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Faction events</span>: If your player population is divided in factions, a faction-wide event can unify strangers against a common adversary.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">League events</span>: Dividing players and groups into leagues with bespoke leaderboards and rewards is a good way to appeal to engaged and competitive players.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_969"/>

<div id="filepos1137077" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Totalizers</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">In <span class="italic">totalizer events</span>, players amass event points (or another special, event-specific resource) by playing the game in a set way, for example, by racing their cars across a special track, scoring headshots with a designated sniper rifle, or killing monsters in a specific arena.</p><p class="calibre_2">Each individual point contribution is added onto the point counter (a totalizer), which usually takes the shape of a long progress bar, with various rewards distributed along the way, and the ultimate reward sitting at the end.<br class="calibre1"/> Once the top reward is reached, the totalizer is complete and further event participation loses much of its purpose (unless a separate leaderboard or high score component is present):</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00202.jpg" class="calibre_105"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">A totalizer event in Transformers: Earth Wars. Players earn points by going into battle, and earn various prizes as they climb towards the top reward</span></span><span class="calibre4">.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_973"/>


<div id="filepos1138386" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Prestiging totalizers</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Prestiging</span> itself is a concept popularized by <span class="italic">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</span>, where players can reset their in-game progress after reaching the maximum experience level, and receive a cosmetic token in exchange. In the context of special events and totalizers, prestiging allows players to complete the same totalizer multiple times, with full rewards gained for each playthrough.</p><p class="calibre_2">Prestiging shifts the focus from simply finishing the totalizer (which may be hard to do if the score requirement is high), and onto completing a shorter totalizer the maximum number of times. Prestiging can be used to democratize the rewards and make the events more accessible for the weaker players and groups.</p><p class="calibre_2">In <span class="italic">Transformers: Earth Wars</span>, we often employed very short totalizers that could be completed up to 60 times, though doing so required a group of experienced and dedicated players. In our case, the top reward on the totalizer was often a gacha crystal, with a small chance of getting a new character. The more times your alliance prestiged the event, the more crystals you amassed and the higher the chances of securing the character. This kind of prestiging rewards hard work, while simultaneously encouraging weak alliances to keep playing, as each completed totalizer gives them a small chance of getting the new character.</p><p class="calibre_2">There is a caveat for combining prestiging and gacha rewards: the individuals and groups at the very top are often upset about losing the certainty of getting the best rewards. As for everyone else, they enjoy the lower concentration of rewards at the top, and welcome a chance to receive the top reward themselves.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_975"/>


<div id="filepos1140380" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Scored leaderboards</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Leaderboards are a video game staple, and to this day, they remain a highly effective component that invigorates competition, and gives recognition to the outstanding performance of the very best players in each game:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00050.jpg" class="calibre_106"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Event leaderboard in Transformers: Earth Wars</span></p><p class="calibre_2">In the context of live operations, temporary leaderboards can be used to track event performance on a group or individual level. At the very end of the event, various rewards can then be distributed to each participant based on their final standings. The number of different reward tiers can vary greatly and is an effect of a very delicate balancing act.</p><p class="calibre_2">To start with, you need to make players care about the top tiers on the leaderboard. Following that, place a few tightly packed and meaningful tiers in the middle of the leaderboard. This can help increase the number of players engulfed in the exciting battles at the verges of each reward tier. To put it bluntly, falling dead-center of a reward tier is not nearly as much fun as fighting fiercely to climb (or hold your position) until the very last minute:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00129.jpg" class="calibre_107"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Different reward tiers in Transformers: Earth Wars</span></p><p class="calibre_2">In a competition with several hundred participants, the reward tiers can look as follows: 1-5 (top reward), 6-25 (great reward), 26-80 (good reward), 81-150, 151-250 (mediocre reward), 251-400, 400+ (a token of appreciation). For events with a more modest scale, such as localized leagues or mini-competitions with 100 or so players, you can opt for a smaller number of tiers: 1-3, 4-10, 11-25, 26-50, and 51+.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_977"/>


<div id="filepos1142628" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Knockout</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">In knockout (or elimination) events, players start with a limited number of lives or attempts. They then try to set the high score or complete the event before being eliminated.</p><p class="calibre_2">To better balance such systems, try using the current winning streak or score when matching players against one another. Natural escalation of difficulty will make things easier at the beginning and far more exiting after several wins:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00062.jpg" class="calibre_108"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Challenges in Clash Royale are a good example of an elimination event that works on an opt-in basis</span></p><p class="calibre_2">By their very nature, elimination events tend to have a short lifespan, which can be further secured by placing a cap on wins and prizes. The removal of grinding is often welcome by players, but reduces the amount of consumables you can sell. To better monetizate these types of events, try using premium <span class="italic">event entry tickets</span> that can be sold repeatedly to players who dropped out of the event prematurely.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">It's important to note that totalizers, elimination formats, and leaderboards are not mutually exclusive. You can mix multiple event components in the very same event. Experiment with various permutations, rewards, and participation requirements to find the most successful formats for your game.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_979"/>


<div id="filepos1144446" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Event rewards</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Medals, trophies, items, perks, characters, costumes, and vanity content—event prizes depend entirely on what you have at your disposal. With rewards, as with events themselves, there is no silver bullet or a one-size-fits-all solution. There are, however, a few tips you can follow!</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Set the bar</span><br class="calibre1"/>Always start cheap and increase the quality of the rewards as necessary. Beginning with great rewards in the hope of increasing event participation is a terrible mistake that locks you into a dangerous, ever-inflating pattern.</p><p class="calibre_2">With rewards, the only way players are happy to accept is up. Bringing the quality of rewards down is a very long and painful process. Doing so incorrectly will cause massive amounts of dissatisfaction and long-term deterioration of player relations. Players never forget...</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Pick a theme</span><br class="calibre1"/>Split the categories of rewards to make events feel different or encourage more/less participation. Do not overload the event with 10 different types of content; focus on one vector and make it the top objective. A few good examples of strong themes would be a <span class="italic">4-star crystal event</span>, where players focus their efforts to get precious crystal rewards at the top of the totalizer, or a <span class="italic">triple XP event</span> where the main driver of engagement is the additional Experience Points, and the event rewards themselves are purposefully insignificant. Use your rewards to ensure that consecutive events stand out from one another.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Acknowledge the effort</span><br class="calibre1"/>For significant events such as monthly or quarterly leaderboard showdowns, it's advisable to give additional recognition to the winners. If possible, avoid creating an additional reward tier; keeping the best rewards for the top three or five participants is absolutely fine. Instead, give the winners an exclusive cosmetic item, or a permanent place in a virtual hall of fame. The truth is, players at the very top rarely need more resources or better content; they want a reward that no one else can get...</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00182.jpg" class="calibre_109"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Th</span></span><span class="calibre4">e in-game hall of fame in Transformers: Earth Wars is very efficient (a simple newsfeed) but highly effective</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_981"/>


<div id="filepos1147167" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Event participation and engagement</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The success of your events can be measured by three factors:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Event Participation</span>: The percentage of eligible players who participated in the event by completing at least one measurable action. By forecasting and assessing the participation, you can decide whether the effort you spent on preparing the event brings sufficient results. To provide a quantifiable example, for a <span class="italic">mid-core</span> mobile game with an engaged audience, a participation rate of around 75%-80% in a weekend event would be considered very healthy, and anything below 50% is likely to cast serious doubt on the appeal of the event.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Engagement</span>: How much time and effort was spent on the event by an average player. For example, if players need to battle their enemies for event points, engagement measures the amount of completed battles. Engagement stats directly influence the intensity of the event, a factor that we'll describe at length shortly.</li></ol><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Sales</span>: Events are a critical opportunity for monetizing your audience. The financial performance of each event can be broken down into two distinct avenues: direct event sales (players spending to play more, or to improve their event performance) and indirect sales (players being exposed to desirable content that does not influence the event).</li></ol><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_983"/>


<div id="filepos1148904" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Event intensity and player burndown</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Grind-fueled totalizers and tight leaderboard showdowns might be your most effective event formats, but they come at a price…</p><p class="calibre_2">Our communities operate with finite reserves of time, money, and stamina. Running the game at high intensity for too long can exhaust even the most dedicated players, making them feel like they cannot keep up, and are better off leaving the competition (or the game) altogether. We have to do our best to be respectful of the time and effort our players put in our games.</p><p class="calibre_2">At <span class="italic">Space Ape Games</span>, we tend to rank event intensity on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is assigned to casual and relaxed individual events (in which participation is often seen as optional), and 5 represents group-based efforts with high levels of competition and peer pressure (such as alliance leaderboard events).</p><p class="calibre_2">Since high intensity correlates to higher engagement, and by extension longer exposure to our premium offerings, we tend to pair intense events with highly desirable content. That said, in many cases, medium intensity events with high participation and engagement rates (but low levels of competitive play) can be an even better place for some of your most desirable sales. After all, players who decide to spend will have plenty of time to try out and enjoy their new weapon/ability/character, or any other piece of playable content, without having to sacrifice their standing in an important competitive event.</p><p class="calibre_2">The intensity scale may not be very scientific, and at first you’ll often misjudge the levels of event participation and engagement. Nevertheless, preparing events with a certain intensity in mind helps to keep things varied, manage player burnout, and set the financial expectations for each particular week.</p><p class="calibre_2">Populating the live ops calendar far ahead and setting the intensity as early as possible is the easiest way to inform the event design and enforce a healthy event cadence. Take a look at a simple intensity curve spanning ten weekly events: 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 2.</p><p class="calibre_2">Now, we may not know the details of each event just yet, but we already know where the strongest (4, 5) and weakest (1, 2) events are placed, and we can plan our content sales around them. We’ve also ensured that the curve maintains a period of low intensity (1) after the most intense event (5), and have created a space for various event formats all around.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_985"/>


<div id="filepos1151767" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Community and customer support</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The video game community at large is not the easiest one to interact with. Players are rarely aware of the realities that you have to deal with and the obstacles you encounter when making and operating games. It takes months and years to gain the trust of players, and a single mistake or a bad (or badly communicated) decision is enough to lose it.</p><p class="calibre_2">This is where the <span class="bold">community and customer support team</span> (<span class="bold">CCS</span>) comes in. They foster, maintain, and police your communities, as well as provide your team with deep insight into the most pressing issues and general player-sentiment.</p><p class="calibre_2">CCS is an invaluable part of your operations, so try to utilize it to the best of your possibility. Implement daily CCS reports, include CCS in parts of your decision making, and have agents reach out with community suggestions and player feedback on a regular basis.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Supporting players</span><br class="calibre1"/>Helping our players with various game-, community-, and account-related issues is the primary role of each CCS agent. It's hard work that requires a great deal of compassion, assertiveness, and a thick skin. Sometimes, things go terribly wrong and players need to be compensated or refunded; other times, players will try to hack the game, commit fraud, or take advantage of your support team.</p><p class="calibre_2">Establishing a clear set of rules and guidelines is essential to help the CCS lead to draw the line for compensation, and decide on what can be given out to players, in what circumstances, and in what quantities. The vast majority of players will play fairly, but you'll also encounter a great deal of manipulation. Bending the established rules towards a single player can end up being exposed in the form of screenshots, and used against you later down the line.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Gathering feedback</span><br class="calibre1"/>There are several channels that can be used to gather player feedback:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Support tickets created from within the game (if your game supports such a channel)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Emails to your customer support address</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Official chat groups and forums (hosted and moderated by your CCS team)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Unofficial social media pages, posts, tweets, and forums</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Prominent <span class="italic">Send feedback</span> buttons that can be placed in test versions of the game (pressing the button begins an email message to your support address)</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Questionnaires and surveys (distributed via in-game newsfeeds or email newsletters)</li></ul><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Newsletters</span><br class="calibre1"/>Monthly and weekly newsletters are a great way of reaching out to the masses to share news, highlight upcoming events, send out gifts, and re-engage lapsed or lapsing players.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Official chats and forums</span><br class="calibre1"/>Setting up and moderating official chat groups and forums is a great way of interacting with the community outside the confines of the game or official support tickets.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Localized customer support</span><br class="calibre1"/>As we've already highlighted in the chapter on accessibility, localization efforts do not stop with translations of in-game text. A game with a large foreign player base should ideally be supported by CCS agents who can speak their language.</p><p class="calibre_2">At <span class="italic">Space Ape Games</span>, we've managed to assemble a network of international agents composed of in-house staff and external contractors. These agents can provide us with language-specific customer support in Japanese, Chinese, Russian, German, Spanish, and more! We can also use their skills to help us translate our games with quick turnarounds and affordable costs.</p><p class="calibre_2">Each agent (be it in-house or remote) can easily highlight and escalate any issues with the CCS game lead embedded directly within the live operations team.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Live streaming</span><br class="calibre1"/>Running official streams on platforms such as <span class="italic">Twitch, YouTube</span>, and <span class="italic">Facebook</span> is a great way of bridging the gap between the community and the development team. Live streams are easier to produce than prerecorded videos and trailers (there's no editing involved), and give you a unique opportunity to interact with your fan base in a more casual and spontaneous manner.</p><p class="calibre_2">To build up a following, you should try to establish a regular cadence (an hour per week works well), promote the streams in-game and on social media, and try to fill them with valuable (but easy to produce) content such as Q&amp;As, team interviews, sneak peaks of new features and upcoming content, and even game-knowledge quizzes.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_987"/>


<div id="filepos1157137" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Tips and tricks</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Before we close this chapter, let's delve into a collection of tips and tricks that may help you in designing and running your live games:</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Player spending should build up your community, not divide it</span><br class="calibre1"/> Avoid splitting your audience based on their ability to spend. While early access to new content is fine, introducing things such as premium map DLCs is going to split friend groups, reduce matchmaking opportunities, and ultimately hurt both sides of the paying spectrum.</p><p class="calibre_2">Spending should feel good, but the gratification should not come from gaining unfair advantages and penalizing everyone else. In western markets, most players will quickly rebel against a game that's 100% pay to win (where skill, experience, or strategy mean nothing, and the only way to stay competitive is to outspend their rivals).</p><p class="calibre_2">Turn premium content into something that makes the game more fun for everyone else:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Everyone likes to hang around a player with cool-looking gear, impressive visual effects, and amusing animations, and this turns spending on cosmetic content a good experience for everyone.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">While unfair advantages can be very damaging in head-to-head scenarios, the same does not apply to cooperative efforts. Teaming up with someone strong and having them lead the charge rewarding the spenders and non-spenders alike.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Try to embrace reciprocity and drive positive reinforcement within your community:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Make a spender feel helpful by making their 100% XP boost extend a smaller 10% bonus to their teammates.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">If an area of the game is locked behind paid access, you can ensure that only one player has to spend or grant them a way to sponsor their friends.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Players spending on big bundles could receive a couple of free gifts to distribute among their peers. This will not only make both sides of the gift exchange feel good, but also increase the chances of the recipient returning the favor (the power of reciprocity). Some people really enjoy giving. In <span class="italic">Team Fortress 2</span>, a gift box that grants a reward to a random person on the server (excluding the owner) was apparently one of the most popular items.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Disappointments and regrets</span>
<span class="bold">cost dearly!</span><br class="calibre1"/> As you drive desire and curiosity behind your high-end game content, you must ensure that the payoff is worth the hype. Having weeks and even months of hard work and anticipation end up with a disappointment is a sure way to destroy any trust between you and the player. Regrets over spending are even more damaging and will prompt your players to want a refund.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Think of technical performance holistically</span><br class="calibre1"/> Does the user spend ages on the initial loading screen? Are you respectful of their time and custom? Make sure that players can get to the game as quickly as possible, or you might make them miss their short window of opportunity to spend some quality time with you as an entertainment provider.</p><p class="calibre_2">Does the game download only what it needs and when it needs it, or are you charging your players dearly in their bandwidth? Be efficient with what assets you need to download and respect the space your players loan you on their devices. If you don't, your game might be the first to be uninstalled when storage gets low.</p><p class="calibre_2">Does the performance of the game remain stable and smooth even at the most intense and climactic moments? If players spend a lot of time and effort getting to the hardest part of the game and it suddenly crashes or starts to jitter, then they are likely to lose faith in you and your game.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Scarcity influences value</span><br class="calibre1"/> As players grow more experienced and familiar with a game's content, any new findings are sure to excite them. Some goods, no matter how mundane, can increase in value just on the back of being rare and hard (or maybe even impossible) to obtain.</p><p class="calibre_2">The value and prestige of limited rewards can grow in time. A simple icon or badge may start as a worthless aesthetic reward, and later evolve into a rare and powerful sign of a respectful tenure. However, this is only true if you stand firm and keep scarce rewards truly scarce. Introducing an accessible venue for obtaining the content later (for the sake of a small revenue spike) will forever diminish the value of the entire lineup of content.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Focus on daily retention</span><br class="calibre1"/> Increasing your stickiness and developing a gaming habit translates to weekly and monthly retention. Daily rewards can be a powerful mechanic for increasing your retention and pacing progression. Focus on rewarding gameplay (for example, by giving out daily tasks), rather than simply showing up (daily login bonuses, calendars, and so on).</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Optimize your newsletters and notifications</span><br class="calibre1"/> Do not spam your users! When it comes to email newsletters and social media posts, quality beats quantity. Work with your CCS and social and marketing staff to provide players with engaging content such as videos, sneak peaks of upcoming features and events, community highlights, surveys, and Q&amp;As. Localize as much as you can and send the material according to a player's timezone (no one wants an email notification at 2 AM).</p><p class="calibre_2">On mobile platforms, you'll also have access to push notifications (sent by the server) and local notifications (scheduled from within the app itself). It’s often up to the game designer to decide on the frequency and content of this messaging. Aspire to create a smart solution that does not produce 5 notifications within 30 minutes of leaving the app. The most successful communications are context-aware and actionable, inviting players to come back and check on the game just as they become ready for their next session.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">The network effect can make and break your game</span><br class="calibre1"/> The network effect can be described as a positive feedback loop where the value of a product or service increases with the rising number of users.</p><p class="calibre_2">Having your game grow exponentially on the back of its current popularity is great, but the implications of the so-called <span class="italic">demand-side economies of scale</span> are not always positive. Let's say a player spends a few hours crafting a new hat for their character in an MMO game such as <span class="italic">Second Life</span>. The next day, said that gets them lots of attention from other players. This kind of positive reinforcement encourages player to spend the next 2 days making a whole smoking outfit. Following that, they will be naturally drawn towards highly populated places in the hopes of gaining the most amount of recognition. Other, like-minded players are inadvertently encouraged to follow the same behavioral pattern.</p><p class="calibre_2">As a result, the more crowded the location, map, or server, the more popular it becomes. Without sufficient planning, the game may become unplayable due to frame rate issues or server failures, and collapse in disarray, leaving thousands of disappointed customers, and falling victim to its own success.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Put yourself in the consumer's shoes</span><br class="calibre1"/> It's easy for we designers to try and think of individual features that we should and should not monetize based on what other, similar products do. It's far more challenging to take a look at our game through the eyes of multiple players and to identify what they'll actually enjoy spending money on and why.</p><p class="calibre_2">By embracing a variety of player archetypes, their motivations, and desires, we can hope to better cater to their needs. Ultimately, the most sustainable communities are formed on the backs of players who spend money because they want to, not because they have to.<br class="calibre1"/> It's essential for every member of the game team to try and play the game for <span class="italic">real</span>, including undercover, next to normal players, spending their very own money, and experiencing the same highs and lows as everyone else.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Maintain tight control over your rewards</span><br class="calibre1"/> Anything you give out to players will be remembered and evaluated against everything else you do. Inconsistent policies and sparks of random generosity will ultimately lead to an unhealthy economy and unhappy players. This is as true for live ops (in regard to event rewards, bundles, and gacha offerings) as it is for customer support.</p><p class="calibre_2">Customer support representatives need to have a coherent policy on compensating players and assuaging angry spenders. Break the rules for one player and you'll set a precedent that sows the seed for mass discontent.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Beware of stockpiling resources</span><br class="calibre1"/> Overabundant resources are one of the biggest threats to any resource-based economy. Put limits on the maximum amount of resources and consumable items players can hold, and be ready to enforce them!</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Start strong and hook players onto the long-term premise</span><br class="calibre1"/> Remember, a Free to Play game is as easy to pick up as it is to let go. With zero investment required to install, there is no loss aversion preventing players from uninstalling it at the drop of a hat. After all, there's no need to rationalize your monetary investment and <span class="italic">get your money's worth</span>. The first-time user experience is everything, an equivalent to a trailer for a Hollywood action film, where you only have a few minutes to win over the audience. Don’t worry about naming the player profile, selecting servers, or adjusting difficulty settings. Get players straight into gameplay and tackle the mundane bits later.</p><p class="calibre_2">Use the little attention you may have (5-15 minutes) to showcase a strong gameplay hook and establish a clearly defined long-term premise—a dream scenario, an aspiration for players to get behind, a reason to return. The premise could be <span class="italic">collect all characters</span>, <span class="italic">uncover the mystery</span>, <span class="italic">build up your own city</span>, or <span class="italic">explore the uncharted lands</span>. In some cases, you can use onboarding to highlight and perhaps even let the players try out the end-game content. For example, if your sports game has the name and likeness rights to the world-class stars, then give me a chance to play with them for a match or two, to appreciate their value, and only then give me a set of <span class="italic">no-names</span> and set me on a long path to rebuild that dream team.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Do not worry about polishing the first time user experience until you’re well into production. Onboarding segments require tons of iteration and are best made when the game mechanics are nailed down and the team has a lot of experience in making content for the game.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Preview content to spark desire</span><br class="calibre1"/> To build value and desire around your content, the user needs to understand what makes it good. However, in some cases, text, images, and even videos may not be enough to fully showcase the unique qualities of a sleek new weapon, vehicle, or character.<br class="calibre1"/> Some things can only be appreciated (and apprised) when you try them for yourself. After all, nothing can explain the taste of a dish as effectively as tasting it!</p><p class="calibre_2">Do not be afraid to preview and showcase your content.
