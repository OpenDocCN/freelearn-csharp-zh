<div class="section" title="Physics in video games" id="aid-1S2JE1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec54"/>Physics in video games</h1></div></div></div><p>From bullets flying at different speeds and trajectories to gravity playing a role between keeping you grounded and allowing you to float, physics in video games plays an essential part in making experiences realistic and definitely enjoyable (for the most part). Imagine if every weapon fired a bullet in the same way, regardless of the firepower. Then what would be the point between having a sniper rifle or a revolver? This is only one aspect of the role that physics plays in games. Physics in games does not just revolve around trajectories and force; it can include gravity, time travel, and fluid dynamics.</p><p>Some great examples of games that use physics include <span class="emphasis"><em>World of Goo</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Portal 1</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>2</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Mario Galaxy</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Kerbal Space Program.</em></span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00512.jpeg" alt="Physics in video games"/><div class="caption"><p>Image by Portal 2 - An orange liquid that reduces friction so much to give you a substantial boost</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Of course, at the other end of the spectrum, games don't always replicate physics in the most accurate way but rather exaggerate it or dismiss it altogether to allow for innovative and unique gameplay. An example of this would include taking a <span class="emphasis"><em>Leap of Faith</em></span> from great heights in <span class="emphasis"><em>Assassin's Creed</em></span>, into conveniently placed stacks of hay (and even water). Some people have even studied how much hay that you would actually need in order to survive such jumps, which you can find here: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/06/kotaku-bureau-of-weights-measures-studies-fallout-physics-also-beer/">http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/06/kotaku-bureau-of-weights-measures-studies-fallout-physics-also-beer/</a></p><p>When it comes to adding physics to your own game, you must ask yourself to what extent you want your gaming experience to be real. If you want your game to be 100% identical to reality, then you must also consider things like death. If a character can be shot by a bullet, do they bleed out or can they heal themselves? In some cases, your game may end up more of a simulation than a game itself if the interaction is too real. An example is <span class="strong"><strong>permadeath</strong></span> (where the player must restart the game from the beginning after they have died), which you may or may not want in your game/simulation. All of these factors need to be considered when adding physics into games because both the cause and effect will all contribute to how believable the game is and ultimately how enjoyable it will be.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Physics &#x2013; basics"><div class="titlepage" id="aid-1T1402"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec55"/>Physics – basics</h1></div></div></div><p>In this section, we will learn some basic notions of physics, to better understand the Physics engine of Unity later on, and overall become better game developers.</p><p>First of all, what is physics? Aristotle (the same guy from the previous chapter) wrote a treatise entitled <span class="emphasis"><em>ta physika</em></span>, which literally means the natural things. From this treatise (although many before Aristotle have written about natural phenomena), physics has become a science. Nowadays, physics investigates matter, its motion both in time and space, through mathematical models. Ultimately, the goal of physics is to describe how the whole universe works. Physics is divided into four big branches:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Classical mechanics</strong></span>: This deals with the motion of objects</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Thermodynamics</strong></span>: This deals with the temperatures of bodies</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Electromagnetism</strong></span>: This deals with electromagnetic waves/particles</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Quantum mechanics</strong></span>: This deals with the study of subatomic particles</li></ul></div><p>You don't need to see these as separate entities but just faces of the same coin, which is the model of the world that physics over the centuries has tried to unravel. Therefore, many topics cross them all, and so the division in not univocal. But, it's a good way for newcomers to physics to get an overview.</p><p>In this chapter, we will deal only with classical mechanics, and in particular with the motion of rigid bodies. However, other branches and sub-branches of physics are also really useful in game development. For instance, we can use light equations, which are implemented in shader, or fluid dynamics to simulate oceans and waves. Even when the evil wizard casts his most terrible fireball, we need to calculate many different physics equations to have a realistic behaviour and look. Imagine just simulating the fire around the ball.</p><p>Most of the time, you don't want to go into that much detail, if you already have a game engine like Unity (or Unreal). In fact, their programmers will take care of this for you. However, sometimes you may have special needs, and you need to write your own shader or code some physics-based behaviours. As such, knowledge of physics is greatly and immensely helpful.</p><p>Of course, this is not a course in physics nor a book dedicated to physics programming (for example, algorithms that can simulate more or less approximately and efficiently some physical behaviours). However, in this chapter, we will consolidate the really basic concepts of physics so that we can have a rough idea of how it all works together. As such, this and the upcoming sections will be dedicated to building a foundational understanding of physics so that we can better grasp the Physics engine behind Unity.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note55"/>Note</h3><p>I know that some of you might find physics somewhat boring. This may be the case if it awakes some bad memory (or memories) from high school. But my personal opinion is that knowing physics is really important to be a good game developer, especially when you need to program realistic behaviours. With this said, I promise that in this section, I'll try to be as clear as possible and use an informal language instead of the strict mathematical one so that these concepts can be understood by anyone.</p></div><p>Classical mechanics of rigidbodies can be divided into two sub-branches:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Kinematics: Which deals with the study of the motion.</li><li class="listitem">Dynamics: Which deals with the causes of the motion.</li></ul></div><p>Of course, once again, they are faces of the same coin. In fact, dynamic equations need kinematic ones, so as to describe and predict the motion of rigidbodies. We will see them in a bit more detail soon, but first let's focus on some basic concepts.</p><div class="section" title="World coordinates and local coordinates"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec48"/>World coordinates and local coordinates</h2></div></div></div><p>As we have already seen in <a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Baking Cupcake Towers" href="part0028.xhtml#aid-QMFO1">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Baking Cupcake Towers,</em></span> there is a difference in using world coordinates and local coordinates. This is also an important concept in physics: which one is your reference frame (or coordinate system)? The question is key in determining also the values of the different physics quantities. Therefore, every time you have a physical quantity, you need to ask yourself in which reference frame are you working.</p><p>In any case, there isn't a frame that is privileged with respect to another (although some physical systems are easier to describe within a frame instead of another). So, by convention, a world frame is defined when we start the description of a physical system. For example, if you are driving your car, what is your velocity? Well, the answer depends on the coordinate system, or reference frame in which I'm describing the car moving. In the car itself, the speed of the car is zero, but rather the world is coming towards the car. Whereas for a pedestrian, the car is moving, and the world is not. An astronaut on the moon will see both the pedestrian moving really fast, along with the whole Earth, and also the car, at two different speeds. All of these descriptions are physically correct. Therefore, all quantities in physics depends on the reference frame.</p><p>In game engines such as Unity and/or Unreal, there is always a defined world frame (when you have the position with all zeros at the center of the world frame) as shown in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00513.jpeg" alt="World coordinates and local coordinates"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>The preceding diagram shows how other frames are described in terms of linear and angular offset from the world frame. Moreover, you can describe a frame in terms of another, which is not the world frame (in the preceding diagram, look at the angular offset of frame <span class="strong"><strong>#3</strong></span>). In Unity, you can consider the world frame as the global coordinates and the different frames as the local coordinates of game objects in the game. Children of game objects will be expressed in terms of the frame of the parent.</p></div><div class="section" title="Velocity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec49"/>Velocity</h2></div></div></div><p>Velocity in physics describes a relation between the space and the time of an object; in other words, how the object changes position with respect to a reference frame as a function of time. When the object is not accelerating, velocity is defined as distance covered in space divided by time.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note56"/>Note</h3><p>For those of you who are curious, when an object changes its velocity in each instant, and we need to get the velocity in a specific instant, it is possible to retrieve it by using derivatives (this is a topic of calculus, and I won't adventure deeper in this book).</p></div><p>Velocity is a vector, and therefore it has two coordinates in the 2D world (three in the 3D world), which express a direction and an intensity. The intensity of a velocity is also called <span class="strong"><strong>speed</strong></span>. So it's important to not get confused between the two. In fact, speed is a scalar, just a number, acting independently if we are dealing with 2D or 3D games; velocity, instead, does change (from two numbers to three numbers to express respectively the 2D or 3D vector).</p><p>Whenever we use the term velocity, we mean the velocity in the defined world frame (or coordinate). When we use the term relative velocity, we are taking the velocity with respect to another frame. For instance, imagine that there are two cars that are heading against each other, both at 50 Km/h (in the world frame, because when you look at your tachymeter, by convention, that is the velocity with respect to the Earth). For one of the two drivers, the car he is driving is not moving (in fact, when you drive, your steering wheel is not going 50 Km/h away from your hands, but it is always at the same distance from you). However, he will see the other car with the other driver coming at 100 Km/h towards him.</p></div><div class="section" title="Mass"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec50"/>Mass</h2></div></div></div><p>In classical mechanics, every rigid body has a mass, which you can imagine as the amount of matter that forms that body. Thus, it is considered a property of the physical body. Often in spoken language, mass is confused with weight. In fact, mass is measured in kg (kilograms) in the International System of Units, whereas weight is measured in N (newton) in the International System of Units. Therefore, a scale is not measuring your weight, but rather your mass. Weight is a force and depends on the location where you are. Your weight is different on the moon, but your mass is the same.</p><p>Sometimes, mass is also defined as the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a force is applied. In fact, you need much more force to move a truck than your laptop.</p><p>However, it is worthwhile paying attention that, for instance, both the laptop and the truck (in absence of other external forces) are attracted by the gravity of the Earth and that both will fall down and touch the ground at the same time. In fact, when the universal gravitation equation of Newton is applied, the forces applied are different but the resulting gravitational acceleration is the same for both objects (since the mass is simplified from the equations).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note57"/>Note</h3><p>For the more curious of you, this was discovered by the famous Italian astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher, and mathematician Galileo Galilei, much before Newton formalized gravitation. There is an anecdote in which Galileo had dropped balls of the same material but different masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. In this way, he proved that Aristotle's idea that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, in direct proportion to weight (at that time intended as mass) was wrong as shown in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00514.jpeg" alt="Mass"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div><div class="section" title="Centre of mass"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec55"/>Centre of mass</h3></div></div></div><p>Imagine you need to calculate or predict the trajectory of an arrow. Taking into consideration the whole shape of the arrow and knowing that different forces come into play at each point ends up in a really tricky calculation (although possible). Therefore, the center of mass is an approximation that works pretty well for rigid bodies. It consists of concentrating the whole mass of an object into a single point (which is an abstraction to imagine all of the mass of that body in that single point). Where this point is depends on the shape of the object (since it is weighted among all the points the object is composed of), and this carries enough information about the shape to do really precise calculations. Especially in real-time applications, this becomes critical, since calculations of motion are greatly simplified. In fact, Unity will only do calculations using the center of mass.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00515.jpeg" alt="Centre of mass"/><div class="caption"><p>The center of mass is the weight average of all the points in the system, where the weights are the different masses. From the diagram, we can see that center of mass is closer to m1 and m3, since they are bigger (have more mass) than m2.</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div></div><div class="section" title="Kinematics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec51"/>Kinematics</h2></div></div></div><p>The term kinematics was used for the first time around 1840, as the translation of the French term <span class="emphasis"><em>cinématique</em></span>, which was used by <span class="emphasis"><em>André-Marie Ampère</em></span> (the famous French physicist and one of the founders of classical electromagnetism — so famous that the electric current unit in the International System of Units, the ampere, was named after him). However, the origin of the term derives from the Greek word <span class="emphasis"><em>kinesis</em></span>, which means movement or motion.</p><p>To have a better understanding of what kinematics is in physics, let's refer to Wikipedia:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics which describes the motion of points (alternatively particles), bodies (objects), and systems of bodies without consideration of the masses of those objects nor the forces that may have caused the motion. Kinematics as a field of study is often referred to as the geometry of motion."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Kinematics takes into consideration just the motion of an object and not the causes of the motion. This gives us some advantages when it comes to game development. First of all, it is cheaper from a computational point of view to take into consideration just the kinematics of an object. Then, we might not want to have a fully realistic object in our scene, and so we can just define its kinematic properties. We will see this in detail later when we will deal with kinematic bodies in Unity.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note58"/>Note</h3><p>Of course, in our world, a pure kinematic body doesn't exist; all of them are dynamic. Yet, studying just the kinematics of an object gives us insights into its motion.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Dynamics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec52"/>Dynamics</h2></div></div></div><p>The term dynamic was used in the 19<sup>th</sup> century in the meaning of pertaining to the force producing motion, as opposite to static. Once again, it takes its origin from the French term <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamique</em></span>, although it was introduced by the famous German mathematician and philosopher, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz. However, the origin of this term is again from the Greek word <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamikos</em></span>, which means powerful, and also from <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamis</em></span> (power) and <span class="emphasis"><em>dynasthai</em></span> (to be able to, to have power, and to be strong enough).</p><p>If not already explicitly suggested, every time we deal with something dynamic in physics, we are dealing with forces (which have a certain power to move objects). From Wikipedia we can read:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"Dynamics is a branch of applied mathematics (specifically classical mechanics) concerned with the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion, as opposed to kinematics, which studies the motion of objects without reference to its causes. Isaac Newton defined the fundamental physical laws which govern dynamics in physics, especially his second law of motion."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Therefore, dynamics is built on top of kinematics and gives a better description/prediction of how the body will move. In fact, by taking forces into consideration, mass, gravity, drag, and many other things become really important and relevant.</p></div><div class="section" title="Force and torque"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec53"/>Force and torque</h2></div></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>
<span class="emphasis"><em>"Forces are those things that allow motion; they are responsible for creating a motion</em></span>."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Every force applies an acceleration to a body, which is calculated with Newton's second law. It is so simple and elegant that it's easy to understand. We can see this law as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00516.jpeg" alt="Force and torque"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Where <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> represents the force, which is a vector (so the arrow above the formula), <span class="emphasis"><em>m</em></span> is the mass, and <span class="emphasis"><em>a</em></span> is the acceleration, which is another vector (so the arrow above its symbol in the formula).</p><p>This means that if you apply a force to an object with mass <span class="emphasis"><em>m</em></span>, you know that the acceleration is <span class="emphasis"><em>F/m</em></span>. So, just divide the force by the mass of an object and you can calculate how much it will be accelerated. Please note that if we have two objects on which we apply the same force but they have two different masses, the one with the higher mass will have a lower acceleration, because the force is divided by a greater number.</p><p>The concept of force is important because it is the cause of motion, and many Physics engines (including the one of Unity) allow you to specify forces.</p><p>Another important concept is torque, also called moment of force or just moment, which in some way expresses a force that makes an object rotate along an axis instead of moving it. If you think of force like a pull or push, you can imagine torque as a twist.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note59"/>Note</h3><p>To those of you who know a bit more about the cross-product of vectors, torque is defined as the cross-product between the force vector and the distance vector from the application point of the force. As a result, it tends to produce rotational motion. Therefore, the formula is:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00517.jpeg" alt="Force and torque"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Where <span class="emphasis"><em>τ</em></span> (read tau) is the torque, <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> is the force vector, and <span class="emphasis"><em>r</em></span> is the distance vector, also called offset.</p><p>In the the International System of Units, torque is measured in <span class="emphasis"><em>N·m</em></span> (Newton meter).</p></div><p>The formula of torque is a bit more complicated since it involves the cross-product, and one who has just started to deal with physics in video games and uses a graphics engine like Unity doesn't need to know/understand the formula straightaway. However, it is important to understand that this quantity deals with rotations, and applying a torque on a rigid body means that it will rotate along an axis depending on where the torque is applied. Just remember that torque is not a force, although it might seem so due to the way we will deal with it within Unity.</p></div><div class="section" title="Collisions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec54"/>Collisions</h2></div></div></div><p>In classical mechanics, there are different kinds of collisions between rigid bodies that may happen. They are divided into two categories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Elastic collisions, in which all the kinetic energy is conserved.</li><li class="listitem">Inelastic collisions, in which part of the kinetic energy is transformed into another form of energy.</li></ul></div><p>To go through this chapter, it's not important to understand them well, but it is important to understand that the type of collision may change the behaviour of what happens after the collision. Imagine two balls: one rolling towards the second, which is not moving. At a certain point, the first one will collide with the second. Depending on which kind of collision happens, the result may differ. In one scenario, both the balls will roll in the same direction and they will be as if they were attached. In another scenario, the first one stops and the second one starts to roll. In a third scenario they roll at different velocities and directions after the collision.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00518.jpeg" alt="Collisions"/><div class="caption"><p>The three possible after-collision scenarios</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>If you want to learn more, a web page that explains the basic concepts of different collisions in a quite simple way is <a class="ulink" href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html</a>. However, it is intended for those who already have a clear knowledge of the basic concepts and formulae of physics.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note60"/>Note</h3><p>The website itself, <a class="ulink" href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu</a>, is a good source for quick references to the main concepts of physics. However, a minimum of prerequisites are needed to fully understand what's on it. The best way to start is always with a physics book, which may be boring, but mastering those concepts is a great advantage.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Rigid body"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec55"/>Rigid body</h2></div></div></div><p>A rigid body, as the name suggests, is a body that translates and rotates all together. So for instance, a Christmas ball, a television, or a flying disk are rigid bodies, because all their parts move together. A laptop is not, because its lid can rotate, as well as a door if you consider the frame too as a part of the whole. But, these kinds of objects can be described with two different rigid bodies, such as the door-frame and the door itself, which may constrain each other (in this case with a Hinge). Water, air, toothpaste, or a dress are not considered rigid bodies, because all their parts don't move together.</p><p>Most of the objects in your game will be rigidbodies (I'm writing it attached because this is the way Unity will refer to them), or they can be approximated to rigidbodies, so knowing them well is key to learning physics in Unity. In fact, most of the 2D Physics engine of unity is focused on rigid bodies (as we will see soon), and therefore this chapter is about them.</p><p>Simulating clothes, liquids, and other physical entities that are not rigidbodies is generally harder, although possible. But often they are used in 3D games, and we won't deal these aspects in this chapter.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note61"/>Note</h3><p>For the most curious of you, here is a more precise definition:
 A <span class="strong"><strong>rigid body</strong></span> is the idealization of a solid body, where deformation is neglected. Therefore, the distance between any two points within the rigid body remains constant over time, independently of the forces that will apply on the rigid body.</p><p>Of course, in our world such objects don't exist. In fact they are idealizations, but they approximate the behaviour of solid objects pretty well (unless the speed of an object is near the speed of light).</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Friction – linear and angular drag"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec56"/>Friction – linear and angular drag</h2></div></div></div><p>If a kid were to ask me, "what is friction?" I would reply, "friction is the thing without which all things wouldn't stop moving". Even if this is not a formal definition, it helps to understand what friction is. It comes into play when you consider the dynamics of an object, because friction generates a force that opposes to the motion of the physical body. There are many types of frictions and they depend on different factors. For instance, air drag depends on the velocity of an object, whereas dry friction depends on the normal force (which depends on the surface, position of an object, its weight, and therefore also its mass).</p><p>In games, except for specific needs, you don't need all these kinds of frictions and drags. For instance, in Unity you can control just the linear and the angular drag. The first one opposes the motion of an object along a trajectory (or better, the trajectory of the center of mass of the object; otherwise it would be too complicated to do in real time) and the angular to the rotation of an object. So, in Unity, an object that has both nonzero values for linear and angular drag will eventually stop moving and rotating (in the absence of other forces).</p></div></div>

It is divided into two parts: 2D Physics and 3D Physics. It's important to understand that although they can coexist together in the same scene, they are two separate entities; they cannot communicate between themselves. Physical objects under 2D Physics will not interact with physical objects under 3D Physics.</p><p>In this section, we will explore most of the 2D Physics engine of Unity.

The first question we may wonder is when does the Physics engine occur when a frame is rendered? The answer is not straightforward, because the Physics engine runs multiple times during a frame render. In any case, except particular cases (such as the application has paused or particular game objects are enabled/disabled in that frame), the Physics engine runs after the initialization (so all the <code class="literal">Awake()</code>, <code class="literal">Start()</code>, and <code class="literal">OnEnable()</code> functions) and before to gather inputs from the player and update the game logic.</p><p>As a result, when we do a physics calculation (we will see these later in the chapter), we need to use the <code class="literal">FixedUpdate()</code> function, which is called more than once per frame, and all the times just before the Physics engine performs its calculation. As such, if we need to retrieve the time, we cannot use <code class="literal">Time.deltaTime</code>; instead we need to use <code class="literal">Time.fixedDeltaTime</code>.</p><p>Another question we may wonder is when it is appropriate to use the Physics engine of Unity. In theory, you don't need to use it, because you can program from scratch all the collisions and/or physic behaviours. In practice, it solves many common problems with minimum coding and it is indeed useful. These problems are not necessarily physics problems. In fact, some of them include certain game mechanics that may enhance the quality of your game when using a physics approach (such as the movement of the character). Others include gathering information from the environment for scripting other behaviours (such as a script that needs to know how many targets there are within a zone).</p></div><div class="section" title="Physics settings in Unity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec58"/>Physics settings in Unity</h2></div></div></div><p>First of all, the Physics engine of Unity has some general settings, which should be taken into account. They define global physical properties of your game, such as the value of gravity, what will collide with what, and how accurate the Physics simulation should be.</p><p>You can have access to the Physics settings in Unity by navigating through <span class="strong"><strong>Edit | Project Settings | Physics 2D</strong></span> as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00519.jpeg" alt="Physics settings in Unity"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note62"/>Note</h3><p>Similarly, you can have access to the 3D Physics setting by navigating through <span class="strong"><strong>Edit | Project Settings | Physics</strong></span>.</p></div><p>The following screen will appear in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> view (the most important parameters are highlighted, which we will see in detail in this section):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00520.jpeg" alt="Physics settings in Unity"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>As you can see, there are many options you can tweak. Most of the time, especially for simple games (like the one we are building), the default settings will be more than fine. But Unity offers you the chance to adapt them to your game.</p><p>Most of them deal with how accurate the Unity Physics engine is. Therefore, there is a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, since more accurate means more expensive from a computational point of view.</p><p>Let's go through the main ones in detail (if you are interested in learning also about the others, see the optional, <span class="emphasis"><em>Other things about Physics</em></span> section later in the chapter):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Gravity</strong></span>: The vector that defines the gravity acceleration. By default, it is a negative value only along the <span class="emphasis"><em>y-</em></span>axis. In particular, the absolute value of 9.81 corresponds to the one on the Earth, if we let the Unity units be meters.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Default Material</strong></span>: The physical material used by all the colliders and rigidbodies that don't have one set (we will see more about physical materials later on).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Time To Sleep</strong></span>: The time, expressed in seconds, that needs to pass before a Rigidbody 2D goes to sleep, which means that it is not updated anymore by the Physics engine (we will see more about rigidbodies and their sleeping later on).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Linear Sleep Tolerance</strong></span>: This is the linear speed below which the rigidbody after <span class="strong"><strong>Time to Sleep</strong></span> goes to sleep. Imagine you have many objects in your game that drag is slowing down, and now they are so slow that the player can barely perceive their motion. As such, it's a waste of computational resources to keep them updated in the Physics engine. Therefore, this variable puts a limit to the lowest velocity an object can have before it goes to sleep (no more updates from the Physics engine). The lower this value, the more accurate the simulation will be, but it will also be more expensive if many objects are moving at velocities above that one.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Angular Sleep Tolerance</strong></span>: The angular speed below which the rigidbody after <span class="strong"><strong>Time to Sleep</strong></span> goes to sleep. Imagine the same situation as before, but instead the body is rotating really slowly. The same reasoning applies: the lower the value, the more accurate the simulation, but usually it is more expensive.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Layer Collision Matrix</strong></span>: This determines which kinds of objects collide with others. By default, everything is checked, but you may want to make two particular kinds of objects not collide among them. Objects are discriminated based on the physical layer they are in. If you remember, we talked about layers and tags in Chapter 1, <span class="emphasis"><em>A Flat World in Unity</em></span>. So, through the layer menu, you can create new layers, and in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, you can assign a layer to a particular game object. To make things easier, the <span class="strong"><strong>Layer Collision Matrix</strong></span> is presented in this screenshot:</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00521.jpeg" alt="Physics settings in Unity"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>For our game, we can leave all the default values since they are more than fine for what we need.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" title="Rigidbodies"><div class="titlepage" id="aid-1VSLM2"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec58"/>Rigidbodies</h1></div></div></div><p>Rigidbodies are, along with Colliders, the core of the Physics engine beneath Unity. When they are attached to a game object, they place it under the control of the Physics engine, which will take care to properly move its Transform. In fact, they should be moved with other functions, and scripts shouldn't touch the Transform. We will see this in detail later.</p><p>The exact name of the component is <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody 2D</strong></span> (whereas <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody</strong></span> is for the 3D Physics engine, but for brevity many times we will use the term rigidbody to specify a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody 2D</strong></span> component).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note63"/>Note</h3><p>From Unity 5.4, and then again in Unity 5.5, the <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody 2D</strong></span> component has slightly changed. In fact, many improvements have been made to the Physics engine of Unity.</p></div><p>Once the component is added to a game object, it looks like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00523.jpeg" alt="Rigidbodies"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="section" title="How a Rigidbody 2D works"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec59"/>How a Rigidbody 2D works</h2></div></div></div><p>Every time we wanted to position an object (or its children) or move it, we changed its Transform, which defines where it is in the space as well as how it is rotated or scaled. However, the Physics engine will simulate how the object will interact in a world where physics is simulated. So, if the object has a collision with another one, it will change direction or speed. This means that the Physics engine has to change in some way the Transform of the object (that's why we shouldn't touch it with scripts for physical objects; we will see later how to deal with them by scripting). This way is the Rigidbody component, which is a sort of hub between the Physics engine and the properties of the object, including the Transform.</p><p>Therefore, after the Physics engine has made its calculation, it communicates with the rigidbody, which needs to be in its next position, and the Rigidbody component provides to change the Transform to match that new position.</p><p>The same applies to colliders (we will see them in detail soon). Each collider attached to the same object of the rigidbody (or to some of its children) will be linked to the rigidbody, and we shouldn't modify the collider or move it but instead move the whole rigidbody. These colliders, which are linked to the rigidbody, allow the rigidbody to actually collide with colliders of another rigidbody and give them a shape in the physics world.</p></div><div class="section" title="Body types"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec60"/>Body types</h2></div></div></div><p>The most important variable in a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody 2D</strong></span> is the <span class="strong"><strong>Body Type</strong></span>, which is highlighted in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00524.jpeg" alt="Body types"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note64"/>Note</h3><p>If you are using a previous version of Unity (older than 5.5), this variable won't be available. However, you can still get the kinematic mode by checking the <span class="strong"><strong>Is Kinematic</strong></span> parameter, which is available in older versions (from 5.4 and below). You can see this highlighted in the following screenshot (Unity 5.4):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00525.jpeg" alt="Body types"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>

</p><p>Older versions, such as 5.2 and below, are similar to the 5.3.</p></div><p>In fact, depending on how the <span class="strong"><strong>Body Type</strong></span> is set, it affects the other settings available on the component. Moreover, it's important to remember that any <span class="strong"><strong>Collider 2D</strong></span> attached to a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody 2D</strong></span> inherits the <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody 2D</strong></span> component's <span class="strong"><strong>Body Type</strong></span>.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Body Type</strong></span> determines how the object will move, how the colliders will interact, and therefore also how computationally expensive that rigidbody will be.</p><p>Changing the <span class="strong"><strong>Body Type</strong></span> of a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody 2D</strong></span> at runtime can be complicated. There are a few things that you need to consider; for example, when a <span class="strong"><strong>Body Type</strong></span> changes, various mass-related internal properties are recalculated immediately. In addition, all existing contacts for the Collider 2D components attached to the Rigidbody 2D need to be reevaluated during the GameObject's next <code class="literal">FixedUpdate</code>. As a result, depending on the number of contacts and Collider 2D components that are attached to the body, when you change the <span class="strong"><strong>Body Type</strong></span> of the rigidbody, it can cause variations in performance.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note65"/>Note</h3><p>It's worthwhile to mention that sometimes rigidbodies are described as colliding with each other. Although this is true when we talk about physics (so when we talk of rigid bodies), it is not true in the case of Rigidbody 2D<span class="strong"><strong> </strong></span>(the component of Unity). In fact, in terms of the Physics engine of Unity, only colliders attached to rigidbodies will collide. However, saying that two rigidbodies have collided is a short way of saying that their colliders have hit each other.</p></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Body Type</strong></span> can be set to be of three types. Let's see them in detail:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Dynamic</strong></span>: This means that the rigidbody will follow all dynamic calculations, which means dealing with forces that cause motion. In fact, the rigidbody will have a mass and both linear and angular drag. Moreover, the body will be affected by gravity as well. In fact, this is the default body type, since it is the most used and collides with everything. But exactly for this reason, it is also the most computationally expensive body type.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Kinematic</strong></span>: This means that the body is still able to move as a physical object, but there are no forces for its motion, and therefore it is not affected by gravity either. In fact, you need to script its motion with any formula (we will see this later), which may or may not be physically realistic (or maybe it is in your game world). However, it is still able to collide, which means the Physics engine will notify your script that the rigidbody has collided, and then it's up to us what happens next. In the case of a collision with a dynamic body type, the kinematic one is considered immovable, which means with an infinite mass. In fact, all dynamic properties, such as mass, are not available. From a computational point of view, the kinematic body type is faster than the dynamic one, since not calculating all the dynamic forces demands less resources from the Physics engine.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Static</strong></span>: This means the rigidbody is not supposed to move at all under the Physics engine (or under simulation). This is intended for an object with infinite mass. Under a simulation, a static Rigidbody 2D is designed to not move. In the instance of something colliding with it, a static Rigidbody 2D behaves like an immovable object (as if it has infinite mass). It is also the least resource-intensive body type to use. A static body only collides with dynamic Rigidbody 2Ds. Having two static Rigidbody 2Ds collide is not supported. This is simply because they are not designed to move. As a result, there are a limited number of properties that are available for this body type.</li></ul></div><p>To better understand the differences between these body types, here is a table with the different features available for each one of them (we will see them in detail in the next section):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00527.jpeg" alt="Body types"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div><div class="section" title="Rigidbody properties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec61"/>Rigidbody properties</h2></div></div></div><p>In the previous table, we saw many properties; they may or may not be available for some body types. But what do they actually do and what do they determine for the rigidbody? Let's explore these properties in detail:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span>: A physics material that determines properties of collisions, such as friction and bounce (we will see more about physics materials later). This material will be applied to all the colliders under the control of the rigidbody (we will see more about colliders in the next section). This comes in handy when you need to have many colliders with the same physics material.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Simulated</strong></span>: A checkbox that enables the rigidbody to interact with the Physics engine. If it is unchecked, then the rigidbody and so all the colliders referring to it will be disabled and transparent for the Physics engine as if they don't exist. This is useful to enable and disable many colliders at runtime (see the optional <span class="emphasis"><em>More about physics</em></span> section to know more).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Use Auto Mass</strong></span>: A checkbox that, if enabled, allows Unity to calculate the mass of the object by itself. These calculations are based on the dimension and density of each of the colliders that are referring to that specific rigidbody.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Mass</strong></span>: If the previous checkbox is disabled, we can manually specify a mass for our rigidbody.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Linear Drag</strong></span>: The value of the linear drag that affects the rigidbody. If it is different from zero, the object will eventually stop moving.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Angular Drag</strong></span>: The value of the angular drag that affects the rigidbody. If it is different from zero, the object will eventually stop rotating.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Gravity Scale</strong></span>: This is a multiplier to the gravity value for that specific rigidbody. This means that a value of <code class="literal">0.4</code> will reduce the gravity to 40% of its original value. This is useful when in your game you have objects that react to gravity in a different way. Imagine a fireball cast by your wizard; you may want it to have a rather straight trajectory (even if it is still a parabola, unless the trajectory is completely straight and the <span class="strong"><strong>Gravity Scale</strong></span> is set to <code class="literal">0</code>, which means no gravity affects the rigidbody). Whereas you want the grenade of your soldier to have a clear parabolic trajectory, since it is affected by gravity. Values greater than <code class="literal">1</code> lead to a stronger gravity than for its original value as shown in the following diagram:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00528.jpeg" alt="Rigidbody properties"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>On the left in the preceding diagram is a fireball, which is not affected by gravity when the gravity scale is set to zero, leading to a straight line trajectory. On the right is a grenade, which is affected by gravity (because the gravity scale is greater than zero; in this case, it is exactly <code class="literal">1</code>, which means normal gravity). Without other forces, rigidbodies with a linear velocity and affected by gravity have a parabolic trajectory.</p></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Use Full Kinematic Contacts</strong></span>: A checkbox available only for kinematic body types. If enabled, it allows the kinematic rigidbody to collide with other kinematic rigidbodies. By default, it is set to false, which means that the rigidbody will only collide with dynamic rigidbodies (with the exception of colliders set as triggers).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Collision Detection</strong></span>: The way Unity detects collisions. It can be either <span class="strong"><strong>Discrete</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Continuous</strong></span>. In the first case, collision detection is calculated only on the position of the physical objects, and if they collide (which means that if the colliders overlap after the update of the positions of the objects, then Unity calculates the collision). On the contrary, continuous collision detection is calculated on the trajectory itself and not only on the positions of the objects. Imagine you have a really fast bullet, which is heading against a really thin wall. Since the game is discrete (the game renders frame by frame), when the bullet is near the wall, in the next update, it can be so fast that its new position is behind the wall. As such, with discrete collision detection, the bullet has crossed the wall without problems, because the Physics engine doesn't detect any collision. With continuous collision detection instead, the Physics engine is aware of the trajectory that the bullet has followed and does calculations on it. So, even if the the final position of the bullet is behind the wall, the collision is detected and it is properly handled by the Physics engine, which recalculates the new position of the bullet taking the collision into account as shown in the following diagram:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00529.jpeg" alt="Rigidbody properties"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>On the left in the preceding diagram is the discrete method, in which only the different positions between frames are taken into consideration. Therefore, if the position of the bullet in the next frame is behind the wall, the discrete method won't detect the collision. On the right is the continuous method, in which the whole trajectory of the bullet is taken into consideration. Therefore, even if in the next frame the bullet is behind the wall, the collision is detected and a new position is calculated based on the collision. This second method is a bit more computationally expensive.</p></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Sleeping Mode</strong></span>: This is the way Unity deals with whether a rigidbody should be awake or sleeping at the beginning, or whether it has the possibility to sleep at all. The possible choices of this variable, with self-explanatory names, are: <span class="strong"><strong>Never Sleep</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Start Awake</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Start Asleep</strong></span>. A rigidbody is sleeping when it is not taken completely into consideration by the Physics engine (it differs from not being simulated, and now we see why). Imagine how many objects in your game could be potently moving but they don't at the moment. For example, imagine a ball pit with thousands of balls, but at the moment none of them are moving. In this scenario, it's useless to call each one of them in the Physics engine for void calculations. Another example: imagine a pendulum that is stopping, and its oscillation arc is too small to be perceived by the player. Calculating the exact position of the pendulum on this arc is a waste of computational resources. It's better to stop the pendulum or the balls (set them into sleeping mode) until an event, such as the player diving in the ball pit or pushing the pendulum. So, for performance reasons, not all rigidbodies are awake at any moment. However, they can be awoken by an event, which is usually automatic in the Physics engine. But it can also be controlled by you within a script (we will see more details about this in the next section).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Interpolate</strong></span>: When a rigidbody is moving, maybe under a force, the Physics engine performs some calculations on which will be its next position. However, the Physics engine is not perfect and cannot replicate our physics. In fact, algorithms are subjected to numerical instability, which may result in a jerky motion in our case. Therefore, Unity offers you two ways to smooth the motion and make it less jerky, plus the option <span class="strong"><strong>None</strong></span>, in which no smoothing is performed. The first way, called <span class="strong"><strong>Interpolate</strong></span>, takes into consideration the previous position of the rigidbody. On the contrary, the second way, called <span class="strong"><strong>Extrapolate</strong></span>, takes into consideration the prevision of the next position of the object. Both methods work well, and you can perceive the difference between them and <span class="strong"><strong>None</strong></span>. However, the difference between the two could be tricky to understand, especially since their behaviour is really similar, and understanding which one is better for your game can sometimes be determined just by trial and error (unless you have really specific needs).<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00530.jpeg" alt="Rigidbody properties"/><div class="caption"><p>On the left, the trajectory is not interpolated; it leads to a fragmented trajectory. On the right, the trajectory is interpolated and its curve is smoothed.</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Constraints</strong></span>: These prevent the rigid body from moving or rotating in a certain way, if not at all. In the case of 2D, you can freeze the motion along <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> or both axes and rotation along the <span class="emphasis"><em>z-</em></span>axis. All of them are independent checkboxes, which can be selected in any combination. Of course, having all of them selected means that the rigidbody won't be able to move. Imagine you are developing a puzzle game and your main character game needs to move a box, maybe by pushing it. However, we don't want the box to start to rotate on itself if the player doesn't push the middle point of the box. As such, we can freeze the rotation of the box, still allowing the box to move and be pushed by the main character.</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00531.jpeg" alt="Rigidbody properties"/><div class="caption"><p>On the left, there are no constraints, and therefore when the player pushes, the object might rotate. On the right, the rotation is frozen, and when the player pushes, the object won't rotate. Which behaviour to choose depends on the design of your game.</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note66"/>Note</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>Info</strong></span><span class="strong"><strong>: </strong></span>A foldout showing all the other variables of the rigidbody, which is very useful in debugging.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Dealing with rigidbodies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec62"/>Dealing with rigidbodies</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that we have explored the Rigidbody 2D component in detail, let's see how we can deal with it within scripts. As previously explained, scripts are not supposed to change the Transform of a rigidbody. So how we can move them? The answer is that some special functions exist.</p><p>These functions need to be called on the rigidbody; therefore probably you may want to have a reference to the Rigidbody 2D, like this fragment of script:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Reference to the RigidBody2D component </em></span> &#13;
public Rigidbody2D rb2D;&#13;
&#13;
void Start() { &#13;
 <span class="emphasis"><em> //Get the reference to the Rigidbody2D component</em></span> &#13;
  rb2D = GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody2D&gt;(); &#13;
} &#13;
</pre><p>As a result, you can call the functions in this way:</p><pre class="programlisting">Rb2D.NameOfTheFunction() &#13;
</pre><p>Where of course, instead of <code class="literal">NameOfTheFunction</code> there will be one of the functions listed next. However, if you remember, the Physics engine might be called more than once per frame, and therefore all of these functions should be called within <code class="literal">FixedUpdate()</code>.</p><p>So how can we actually move a rigidbody? For dynamic body types, we can either just leave them at the mercy of the external forces such as gravity, collisions, and so on, or we can apply a specific force.</p><p>In order to apply a force to the rigidbody, there are the following useful functions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">AddForce(Vector2 force, ForceMode2D mode = ForceMode2D.Force)</code>: Applies a force specified in the <code class="literal">force</code> parameter. Moreover, enum  <code class="literal">ForceMode2D</code> is an optional parameter that specifies whether the force should act as an impulse or not. By default, it is not an impulse.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">AddForceAtPosition(Vector2 force, Vector2 position, ForceMode2D mode = ForceMode2D.Force)</code>: Behaves like the previous function, but you can also specify an application point for the force.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">AddRelativeForce(Vector2 relativeForce, ForceMode2D mode = ForceMode2D.Force)</code>: Behaves like the first function, but the force is specified in local coordinates.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">AddTorque(float torque, ForceMode2D mode = ForceMode2D.Force)</code>: This applies a torque to the rigidbody; likewise, the first function applies instead a force.</li></ul></div><p>For kinematic body types instead, we have two functions to explicitly move these kinds of body types and still allow the Physics engine to perform collision detection correctly. Inside these functions, we directly pass a position and a rotation, which can be calculated with any formula. Therefore they can follow any physics law you want (or one that is meaningful in your game):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">public void MovePosition(Vector2 position)</code>: Moves the rigidbody to the specified position</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">public void MoveRotation(float angle)</code>: Rotates the rigidbody to the specified angle</li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note67"/>Note</h3><p>The easiest example is to apply the classical kinematic law for velocity to make the kinematic body move in a straight line indefinitely. For the most curious of you, the formula is the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00532.jpeg" alt="Dealing with rigidbodies"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>The ∆ (read delta) in physics means the final minus the initialwhich can be rewritten (by explicitly separating the delta of the space) as:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00533.jpeg" alt="Dealing with rigidbodies"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>We can translate this into Unity with the following fragment of code (instead of <code class="literal">Time.deltaTime</code>, we need to use <code class="literal">Time.deltaFixedTime</code>):</p><pre class="programlisting">public Vector2 velocity;

If the Physics engine is super realistic, it should take in consideration that the hand of the heroine can go over the table, as far as the body stays on its side. However, this is impossible (or at least out of reach for the current hardware of your players) to run in real time. So colliders provide an approximate shape for objects and characters that need to have some kind of physical interaction, such as a collision. For instance, characters are often approximated as a capsule-shaped collider and objects with a sphere-shaped or box-shaped collider. Of course, if a deeper level of detail is required, different colliders can act as a more complex one. And ultimately, all the polygons of the 3D model (or perimeter of the 2D Sprite) can be part of the collider, having a much better realism but at the cost of performance. Therefore, you'll want to be careful to always have the right level of detail for each situation.</p><p>In Unity, colliders can be of five types, which are:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

<p>The collider's shape is a capsule without vertexes (so that it is hard it remains stuck between vertexes or corners of other colliders). Moreover, it's a solid collider, so if an object is completely inside this collider, it is pushed out and detected as colliding.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>All of them share the same core settings, and some additional ones to customize the shape of the collider. For instance, for <span class="strong"><strong>Circle Collider 2D</strong></span>, we can decide the center and the radius. However, Unity automatically tries to enclose/envelop the Sprite or 3D model within the collider, though manual tweaking may be required (see further for editing the collider in a visual way).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note69"/>Note</h3><p>Since this book focuses on the 2D world, for brevity we will refer to the colliders without the ending 2D, assuming we are always referring to the 2D component and not to the 3D one with the same name. For example, <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider 2D</strong></span> becomes <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span>.</p></div><p>Let's explore the core options of each collider:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Density</strong></span>: This affects the mass of the rigidbody that it is referring to. A value of zero means that the collider will be completely ignored in the calculation of the mass of the rigidbody. The higher the value, the more the collider will contribute to the mass of the rigidbody.<div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note70"/>Note</h3><p>If you don't see the <span class="strong"><strong>Density</strong></span> option, it's normal. In fact, it will be visible only if the option <span class="strong"><strong>Auto Mass</strong></span> is enabled on the rigidbody associated (so attached on the same game object of the collider or on some of its parents up in the hierarchy). In fact, when the rigidbody component automatically calculates the mass, it takes into consideration all the colliders linked to that rigidbody and their densities.</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span>: A physics material that determines properties of collisions, such as friction and bounce (we will see more about physics materials later).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Is Trigger</strong></span>: Check this if you want the collider to behave as a trigger. This means that the collider won't be used to do collisions but rather to trigger something when another collider enters within this one (see the next section for more details).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Used By Effector</strong></span>: Check this if you want the collider to be used by an attached effector (we will see more about effectors later).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Offset</strong></span>: This is the offset of the collider geometry expressed in local coordinates; in other words, how far in terms of <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> the collider should be from the position of the game object on which it is attached.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Info</strong></span>: A foldout showing all the other variables of the collider. It is very useful in debugging.</li></ul></div><p>Then, there are the specific ones for each collider:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Radius</strong></span>: Used only for the circle collider, and it determines the radius of the circle.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Size</strong></span>: This is used only for the box and the capsule collider. In the first case, it determines the size of the box, and in the second the size of the box that the capsule fills up (and therefore indirectly the size of the capsule) as shown in the following diagram:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00539.jpeg" alt="Colliders"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Points</strong></span>: This is non-editable information for the polygon or edge colliders about their complexity.

For instance, imagine a bullet that hits the surface of the wall, we may want to instantiate a particle effect in the point, and remove the bullet. The same applies for a fireball, but with a fire effect. Or imagine the player walks through a door and a cut-scene is triggered. In this case, there is a volume trigger (a collider with <span class="strong"><strong>is Trigger</strong></span> set to true) so that when the player enters, the volume triggers the cut-scene. Another example, is an area full of toxic gasses, and the longer the player stays in that area, his health is gradually reducing.</p><p>All of this can be achieved by using some special functions. If you remember, in <a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Baking Cupcake Towers" href="part0028.xhtml#aid-QMFO1">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Baking Cupcake Tower</em></span>, we have seen that every script that derives from monobehaviour could have some functions, such as <code class="literal">Start()</code> and <code class="literal">Update()</code> that are automatically called by Unity. Among these functions there are some that are called by the Physics engine of Unity.</p><p>For trigger volumes, there are the following functions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other)</code>: This is called on both the rigidbody and the volume trigger when the former enters in the latter. Information about the other collider is passed as a parameter in the <code class="literal">other</code> variable.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">OnTriggerStay2D(Collider2D other)</code>: This is called on every frame on both the rigidbody and the volume trigger as long as the former is within the second one. Information about the other collider is passed as a parameter in the <code class="literal">other</code> variable.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">OnTriggerExit2D(Collider2D other)</code>: This is called on both the rigidbody and the trigger volume when the former leaves/exits the second one. Information about the other collider is passed as a parameter in the <code class="literal">other</code> variable.</li></ul></div><p>For colliders not set to be triggers, there are similar functions. However, instead of having just information about the other collider, information about the whole collision is available through the class <code class="literal">Collision2D</code>, which stores — other than the colliders — the contact points, relative velocities, and so on. More information about this can be found here in the official documentation at: <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collision2D.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collision2D.html</a></p><p>So, the functions for colliders are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D coll)</code>: This is called on both the rigidbodies/colliders that have just made contact (had a collision). Information about the collision can be found inside the <code class="literal">coll</code> variable.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">OnCollisionStay2D(Collision2D coll)</code>: This is called on both rigidbodies/colliders every frame as long as they are touching each other. Information about the collision can be found inside the <code class="literal">coll</code> variable.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">OnCollisionExit2D(Collision2D coll)</code>: This is called on both two rigidbodies/colliders when they stop making contact. Information about their collision can be found inside the <code class="literal">coll</code> variable.</li></ul></div><p>In our specific case, we will need these functions (the trigger ones) to detect when the sprinkles hit the enemies, to reduce their health, and eventually trigger the right animation. We will see this at the end of the chapter.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Joints"><div class="titlepage" id="aid-21PMQ2"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec60"/>Joints</h1></div></div></div><p>So far, we have talked about rigid bodies and colliders, but they were just single physical bodies. What about more complex mechanical systems? Imagine a rope that is holding a cage with a skeleton and a key inside. So, our protagonist decides to cut the rope to make the cage fall. Once the rope is broken, then the cage falls down. However, even before the rope is cut, the cage was under the effect of gravity. In fact, if our protagonist would have pushed the cage instead of cutting the rope, that would have started to oscillate. The reason is that the rope is giving a constraint to the cage — it is allowed to move only within a circle (or sphere if we are in 3D) that has per radius the length of the rope. Of course, when it oscillates, gravity makes the cage move on the border of this circle (or sphere). What if the rope were a rigid metal bar? Well, the cage would even have a harder constraint, because now it is forced to be only on the border of the circle (or sphere). And if the rope was a spring? Again, this is another kind of constraint as shown in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00541.jpeg" alt="Joints"/><div class="caption"><p>Although the cage is under the force of the gravity, the rope imposes a reaction force. As a result, the cage doesn't fall. Therefore, the rope imposes a constraint on the cage. In particular, it limits the cage motion to be within a circle with a radius equal to the rope length.</p></div></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Now, imagine placing many of these constraints together. For instance, you tie up the cage to a pending spring, and from the bottom of the cage a rope is holding a metal sphere. The system would start to increase in complexity. But how does Unity handle all of this? The answer is, using Joints components.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note72"/>Note</h3><p>Note that all the joints that finish with 2D belong to the 2D Physics engine; otherwise they belong to the 3D one. So be careful to not get confused or attach the wrong joint. However, from now on, we will always refer to it as Joint 2D, even without 2D, unless otherwise specified. This decision was made to make the chapter clear and more fluid to read.</p></div><div class="section" title="Main properties of Joints"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec64"/>Main properties of Joints</h2></div></div></div><p>By using a joint component, you can attach a rigidbody to another one, in order to give them a specific constraint, and still leave some freedom for the motion. In particular, Unity provides nine Joint 2D components. But before we go through each one of them, let's explore some general properties of the joints in Unity.</p><div class="section" title="The other rigidbody"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec56"/>The other rigidbody</h3></div></div></div><p>As we've already said, a joint involves two rigidbodies (with the exception of the <span class="strong"><strong>Target Joint 2D</strong></span>). The first is attached to the same object of the joint. The other one can be chosen arbitrarily. Therefore, these two options are available inside the joint components:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Enable Collision</strong></span>: Both rigidbodies will have colliders. If this toggle is true, it means that the two rigidbodies will collide between them according to the Physics engine and what we have seen so far in the previous two sections. Most of the times, rigidbodies with a joint belong to the same big system, and you don't want it to collide with itself. As such, the default value is false.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Connected Rigid body</strong></span>: This is the reference to the second rigidbody of the joint, as the name suggests.</li></ul></div><p>Then, most of the joints (with the exception for the <span class="strong"><strong>Relative Joint 2D</strong></span> and the <span class="strong"><strong>Target Joint 2D</strong></span>) needs the two points of the application of the joint. Imagine again the example of the cage pending from the rope. Where the rope is attached to the cage is an important factor, because if the rope is attached to one of the corners of the cage, this will be rotated, as shown in this diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00542.jpeg" alt="The other rigidbody"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>We attached the rope on the cage which is important, because it will affect how it will react to forces. However, it is interesting to note that wherever you append a rigidbody, the line along the rope will pass always through the barycenter (centroid) of the rigidbody.</p><p>Plus, you need to consider the possibility that there are other forces that may move the cage, and again where the rope is attached is an important piece of information. The same applies to the other rigidbody; in the case of the cage, the other rigid body is the ceiling.</p><p>Therefore, there are some options available to determine these two points of application, which are called <span class="strong"><strong>anchors</strong></span> in Unity:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Auto Configure Connected Anchor</strong></span>: If this is checked, Unity will take care to determine where the two anchors are. Of course, turn it off if you have a specific point of application of the joint in mind and you want to place an anchor there.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Anchor</strong></span>: The position in <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> (with respect to the rigidbody) of the anchor of the joint on the rigidbody where it is attached.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Connected Anchor </strong></span>: This is the position in <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> (with respect to the rigidbody of the other object) of the anchor of the joint on the rigidbody specified in the <span class="strong"><strong>Connected Rigidbody</strong></span> variable.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Breaking joints"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec57"/>Breaking joints</h3></div></div></div><p>Coming back to the example of the suspended cage, imagine that the hero decides that it is a good idea try to jump on top of the cage and then jump on another platform. However, he didn't consider that the rope was really old (in fact, there is a skeleton in the cage!), and once he landed on the cage, the rope breaks making both the cage and our hero fall. Therefore, it's true that joints impose a constraint, but they have limits too. For the same reason, if you pull both sides of a rubber with too much force, the rubber will eventually break.</p><p>Also in Unity, Joints can be broken. In particular, in their components there are two variables:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Break Force</strong></span>: This is present in all the joints, and it holds the numerical value of the force after which the joint will break. Breaking a joint in Unity means to erase the Joint component from the object. By default, it is set to be infinity, which means that the joint is indestructible. Otherwise, the lower the value, the easier it is to break the joint. In the example of the cage, if we choose to give a very low value for the joint that simulates the rope, it will be likely that the rope is really old and when our hero jumps on top of the cage, they both will fall in the dungeon of the castle.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Break Torque</strong></span>: This is present in all the joints other than <span class="strong"><strong>Distance Joint 2D</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Spring Joint 2D</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Target Joint 2D</strong></span>. It holds the numerical value of the torque after which the joint will break. As we already have seen, rigidbodies can not only move but also rotate. By default, it is set to be infinity, which means the joint is indestructible. Otherwise, it can be brought to a finite value, allowing the joint to break with torques greater than the value specified.</li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note73"/>Note</h3><p>For an example of a joint that breaks under torque, you can just imagine something that is rotating but it's motion is blocked by something, such as when you use the screwdriver and keep going until the wood (which was the constraint) is broken. However, here is another example that is less intuitive but more common (even in video games). Imagine you append yourself on the boarder/edge of a shelf. Since there is an offset from the center of mass of the shelf and the point where you have appended yourself (they are likely to be perpendicular if the shelf is flat), a torque is applied on the shelf. Under the effect of the torque, the shelf should rotate around its center of mass, but it doesn't since the wall prevents it. If you are heavy enough, which means the force you apply on the shelf is greater (or also if in some way you are able to increase the offset), the torque increases, until it reaches a breaking point. Then the constraint will break, which may result either in a broken shelf or a broken wall depending which one has more resistance (most probably the shelf will break and the wall will still stand). The following diagram should help you to figure the example out:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00543.jpeg" alt="Breaking joints"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Specific joints"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec65"/>Specific joints</h2></div></div></div><p>So far, we have seen only general properties of the joints in Unity, but now we will take a closer look at all the nine joint 2D components available.</p><p>It's worthy to mention that joints are divided into two classes: spring joints and motor joints. The former uses a spring to impose a constraint, which may be completely stiff so as to simulate a rigid bar. Motor joints, instead, can actively apply forces onto the rigidbodies. Some joints are both, like a spring with a motor.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip74"/>Tip</h3><p>All the joints in Unity have an icon (visible when, for instance, you place the component in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>). In this book, you can see the icon in the top-left corner of the images of the joints (in the next sections). This icon is really useful for remembering what the joint does and also how it works. So, when reading the next section, or programming your game, pay attention to this icon, which might help you to understand the joint better.</p></div><div class="section" title="Distance Joint 2D"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec58"/>Distance Joint 2D</h3></div></div></div><p>This joint keeps the two rigidbodies at a certain distance apart. The aim of this joint is to keep at a certain distance two rigidbodies, or a rigidbody and a fixed point in the game world. In fact, if you set the <span class="strong"><strong>Connected Rigidbody</strong></span> variable to <code class="literal">None</code>, you can then specify the position of the fixed point in <span class="strong"><strong>Connected Anchor</strong></span>.</p><p>It should appear like the following in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00544.jpeg" alt="Distance Joint 2D"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>This joint applies a linear force to both the rigidbodies (or just to the rigidbody on which it is attached if using a fixed point) with a very stiff simulated spring (which is not configurable) to keep the distance. The joint doesn't apply any torque.</p><p>In addition to the parameters that we have seen in the last section, <span class="strong"><strong>Distance Joint 2D</strong></span> also has the following options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Auto Configure Distance</strong></span>: If set to true, Unity will calculate the current distance between the two rigidbodies (or the rigidbody and the fixed point) and place its value in the <span class="strong"><strong>Distance</strong></span> variable.</li><li class="listitem">Distance: Specifies the distance beyond which the two rigidbodies (or the rigidbody and the fixed point) cannot go further.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Max Distance Only</strong></span>: If enabled, the distance between the two rigidbodies (or the rigidbody and the fixed point) can be lower than the value specified in the Distance. If this option is disabled instead, the distance is fixed and the two points cannot be any further or closer than the Distance.</li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note75"/>Note</h3><p>Remember that if the <span class="strong"><strong>Break Force</strong></span> of the joint is a finite value, it will eventually break, even if the <span class="strong"><strong>Max Distance Only</strong></span> option is set to false.</p></div><p>When <span class="strong"><strong>Max Distance Only</strong></span> is false, the constraint among the two points is rigid, so you can imagine them connected by a metal string/bar along with a hinge (since they can still rotate with respect to each other). An example of how this is used is when you need to connect two couches of a train together, because they cannot get any farther or closer than a specific distance. If <span class="strong"><strong>Max Distance Only</strong></span> is true, instead, they can be closer than the <span class="strong"><strong>Distance</strong></span>, but not further. This is the behaviour of our rope, which holds the cage. that potentially can get closer to where the rope is tied but not further. Another example is a dog with a leash.</p><p>However, it is important to keep in mind that both the rigidbodies are free to rotate with respect to each other. In fact, this joint imposes the constraint only on the relative position of the two rigid bodies.</p></div><div class="section" title="Fixed Joint 2D"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec59"/>Fixed Joint 2D</h3></div></div></div><p>The aim of this joint is to keep a certain relative offset (both linear and angular) between two rigidbodies or a rigidbody and a fixed point in the game world (you can specify it by setting <span class="strong"><strong>Connected Rigidbody</strong></span> to <code class="literal">None</code>).</p><p>It should appear like the following in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00545.jpeg" alt="Fixed Joint 2D"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>This joints applies both a linear force to compensate the linear offset, and a torque to compensate the angular one. Like <span class="strong"><strong>Distance Joint 2D</strong></span>, it uses a very stiff simulated spring, but you can tweak the spring values, such as the frequency.</p><p>Therefore, in addition to the parameters we have seen in the last section, <span class="strong"><strong>Fixed Joint 2D</strong></span> has also the following options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Damping Ratio</strong></span>: This defines the degree to which the oscillation of the spring is suppressed. Its value ranges from 0 to 1; the higher the value, the less motion. As you would expect from a spring, this joint will overshoot the desired distance and then rebound back, leading the spring to oscillate. The <span class="strong"><strong>Damping Ratio</strong></span> determines how quickly the oscillation is damped (reduced) and thus how fast the spring comes back to its rest position</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Frequency</strong></span>: This defines the frequency at which the spring oscillates when the rigidbodies are reaching the separation distance. It is measured in cycles per second, and its value ranges from 1 to 1 million. The higher the value, the stiffer the spring, which means less motion.

So it needs to be attached to the same game object that has the rigidbody component.</p><p>Here is how it appears in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00560.jpeg" alt="Constant Force 2D"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note81"/>Note</h3><p>Out of curiosity, for this component, there is a 3D counterpart: <span class="strong"><strong>Constant Force</strong></span>.</p></div><p>As the name suggests, it applies a constant force to the rigidbody. Usually this is used in testing to easily apply a force from the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, but it can also be used in the normal gameplay if we need an object that is always under the control of a constant force (so that it will keep pushing). Of course, it's value can be changed through script to make it a non-constant force, but in that case it is preferable to apply the force directly with a function in the script. The component should be used only for constant forces or forces that don't change over time (the force can change, but for long periods of time it remains constant).</p><p>Moreover, this component also can be used to apply a torque on the rigidbody.</p><p>Here are the three variables:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Force</strong></span>: The constant force to apply to the rigidbody.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Relative Force</strong></span>: The constant force to apply to the rigidbody expressed with respect to the rigidbody coordinates</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Torque</strong></span>: The constant torque to apply to the rigidbody</li></ul></div><p>Here is an example of usage that is not testing. Suppose you are doing a game where different objects are affected by different gravitational forces. So for instance, brown boxes will follow on the ground as usual, but green boxes will follow on the right because as per your game design they are supposed to do so. The reason could be an experimental serum invented to change gravity for things that are green. In this scenario, the green boxes cannot be affected by normal gravity, so you can place on them a rigidbody and set <span class="strong"><strong>Gravity Scale</strong></span> to <code class="literal">0</code>. In this way, it won't be affected by normal gravity. Then, place on it the <span class="strong"><strong>Constant 2D</strong></span> force component and set your gravity. Moreover, if all the objects have different <span class="strong"><strong>Constant 2D</strong></span> forces, you can change their gravity force in real time, maybe after the invention of another serum, which changes the gravity on the left instead of the right.</p></div><div class="section" title="Area Effector 2D"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec67"/>Area Effector 2D</h2></div></div></div><p>This component defines an area within which a force is applied to all the rigidbodies inside the area.

In the first case, the force will always be applied to the center of the mass. In the second case, if the collider is not on the center of the mass, the force will also generate torque for the rigidbody.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Drag</strong></span>: This is the linear drag to apply within the region.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Angular Drag</strong></span>: This is the angular drag to apply within the region.</li></ul></div><p>Here is an example of the use of this component. Suppose that there is a special device which is able to push the magnetic shoes of the main character to contrast gravity. So, in the area just above this device, you can place an area effector, specifying a force that goes upwards. Please note that if the intensity of the force is less than the gravity, then your character will have a big jump, but eventually she will fall down. Whereas with a greater value, even without a jump she starts to levitate upwards until either an obstacle or the end of the area effector is met.</p></div><div class="section" title="Buoyancy Effector 2D"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec68"/>Buoyancy Effector 2D</h2></div></div></div><p>This component is used to simulate a fluid, and so it can potentially make rigidbodies floating.

A value of zero means that the surface will lie on the center of the object, and it is placed in the middle of the collider (only if the collider doesn't have any offset).

Suppose that in your 2D game there is the sea, and the main character has to jump on some platforms in the harbor.

The force is always constant regardless of the distance between the rigidbody affected by the effector and the point that repulses or attracts. This means that only the relative positions between the rigidbody and the point are taken into consideration to determine the direction of the force, which lies on both. Instead, in <span class="strong"><strong>Inverse Linear</strong></span>, the force changes its intensity based on the distance between the rigidbody and the point. For double the distance, half intensity of the force. Finally, <span class="strong"><strong>Inverse Squared</strong></span>, which in most cases is the most physically realistic, takes the square of the distance into consideration.

The <span class="strong"><strong>Inverse Linear</strong></span> mode will halve the force by doubling the distance. Finally, the <span class="strong"><strong>Inversed Squared</strong></span> mode (which is the most physically realistic, since both the gravitation and the electromagnetic forces have this behaviour) will have a quarter of the force it would have half way closer to the point effector.</p></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Drag</strong></span>: This is the linear drag to apply within the region of the effector.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Angular Drag</strong></span>: This is the angular drag to apply within the region of the effector.</li></ul></div><p>Here is an example of its usage. Suppose the main character has a special ring that, when active, attracts metal (when the ring is not, it will attract the main character's wife).

For instance, it implements the one-way collision. So if the character jumps from below the platform, he will cross it, but when he lands on top, the platform will give a collision, maintaining the character on top of the platform.

This has been added recently in Unity, and thanks to it, it is possible to rotate the platform effector so as to have platforms that are inclined, or walls that can be crossed one way. For instance, you can use it also for magical portals that can be crossed one way.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Use One Way</strong></span>: If checked, the platform will collide only in one direction.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Use One Way Grouping</strong></span>: This ensures that all contacts disabled by the one-way behaviour act on all colliders. This is useful when multiple colliders are used on the object passing through the platform and they all need to act together as a group.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Surface Arc</strong></span>: This specifies in degrees how wide the arc on top of which the collision will be performed is. In all the other directions, if <span class="strong"><strong>Use One Way</strong></span> is enabled, it won't allow any collision, allowing any rigidbody to pass through, such as your character.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Use Side Friction</strong></span>: If true, friction is applied to the side of the platform effector.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Use Side Bounce</strong></span>: If true, bounce is applied to the side of the platform effector.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Side Arc</strong></span>: This specifies the degree for both the right and left side (if the <span class="strong"><strong>Rotational Offset</strong></span> is set to <code class="literal">0</code>; otherwise it may indicate up and down) that are considered the sides of the platform effector.

Imagine a puzzle game where some portals can be crossed only in one direction. As such, we can place a platform effector and set its <span class="strong"><strong>Rotational Offset</strong></span> so as to have the colliding part only on one side of the portal. As a result, the character will be able to cross the magical portal only in one direction, and not in the other way round as shown in the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00570.jpeg" alt="Platform Effector 2D"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>This is an example of how it is possible to use this effector in another way that is not the classical platform. By rotating the component through the <span class="strong"><strong>Rotational Offset</strong></span>, it is possible to make a magical portal which is crossable in one way, but not in another. This could be an interesting game mechanic for a puzzle game.</p></div><div class="section" title="Surface Effector 2D"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec71"/>Surface Effector 2D</h2></div></div></div><p>This component applies a tangential force to the surface specified by the collider associated with this effector. In other words, you can imagine this as a conveyor belt, which transports rigidbodies along the direction of the force, as far as they are touching the surface.</p><p>This is how it appears in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00571.jpeg" alt="Surface Effector 2D"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>It is possible to have access to the options of the <span class="strong"><strong>Surface Effector 2D</strong></span> through two foldouts, and you can find the parameter that you can set here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Speed</strong></span>: The speed that the tangential force should maintain. In other words, it's the speed of the conveyor belt.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Speed Variation</strong></span>: The maximum variation of the speed, so as to not have always a constant speed, especially if you have many of these effectors. The random variation ranges from zero to the value in <span class="strong"><strong>Speed Variation</strong></span>. Therefore, a positive value brings a random increment, whereas a negative value brings a random decrement.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Speed Scale</strong></span>: This allows you to scale the tangential force that is applied when the effector tries to accelerate the contacting rigidbodies to the specified speed along the surface. If it is set to <code class="literal">0</code>, then no force is actually applied, and it is like that the component is disabled. On the other hand, if it is set to <code class="literal">1</code>, means that the full force is applied. A useful way to think of this parameter is to think about how fast the rigidbody, which is in contact with the surface, is then accelerated to meet the specified speed; lower values means it will require more time, whereas higher values means it will reach the speed much quicker. However, you should be careful to use the full force, since a rigidbody might face other forces, leading the rigidbody to an undesired motion.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Use Contact Force</strong></span>: If true, a contact force will be used. Although it is more physically realistic, it may impress a torque to the rigidbody contacting the surface. As such, in video games where realism depends on the design, you can choose to enable it, since the default is disabled. An easy way to imagine this is that you are jumping on a real conveyor belt. The contact force along with the tangential force of the conveyor belt will make your legs move forward, but your chest will stay behind due to inertia, which may result in you falling. That means your body has started to rotate due a torque as shown in the following diagram:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00572.jpeg" alt="Surface Effector 2D"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></li></ul></div><p>In this example, when you jump on the conveyor belt, your legs are brought forward by the tangential force of the belt. Your chest, instead, stays behind due to inertia, leading to an applied torque on your body, and therefore you will fall. In Unity, it is possible to disable the contact force, so as to ensure that a torque is not applied to rigidbodies that enter in contact with the conveyor belt.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Use Friction</strong></span>: If true, there will be friction on the surface</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Use Bounce</strong></span>: If true, there will be bounce on the surface</li></ul></div><p>Of course, the natural example of usage is when in your game a conveyor belt is used. But let's try to find out another example. Suppose that the protagonist of your game has a special glove that when it touches a metal wall, it is able to contrast gravity by creating a magnetic field. You can place a surface effector vertically, and apply a force upwards as far as the player is touching that wall.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" title="Dealing with physics in Unity" id="aid-24L8G1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec63"/>Dealing with physics in Unity</h1></div></div></div><p>So far, everything went smooth and we learned about all the single components of the Physics engine of Unity. However, when it comes to building your own game, dealing with physics might be a little bit tricky. In fact, just some wrong values on some forces and the whole scene can quickly mess up. The best way to solve this is by trial and error. The more you experiment, the more you will become practical with the Physics engine, and you will develop an intuition on how to balance all the values in your game. As a result, you will be able to make your scene act as described in the game design document (or almost).</p><p>Dealing with physics isn't just about placing the different components, but also about how to program them. We have already seen some useful functions to apply on a rigidbody as well as some events when two colliders hit each other. But there is more. First of all, it's important to understand that all the variables we have seen of all the components (such as rigidbodies, colliders, joints, and effectors) can be assigned dynamically at runtime with a script. You just need to get a reference to that component, and then you will be able to change its internal parameters.</p><p>One more thing that can come in handy is the possibility to query the Physics engine through some functions in order to gather some information about the surroundings. These are static functions of the <code class="literal">Physics2D</code> class, and so they can be called with the following fragment of code:</p><pre class="programlisting">Physics2D.NameOfTheFunction(); &#13;
</pre><p>Of course, you need to substitute <code class="literal">NameOfTheFunction</code> with the function. The <code class="literal">Physics2D</code> class exposes many of these, but let's explore just the main ones:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">OverlapCircleAll(Vector2 point, float radius, [<span class="emphasis"><em>optional parameters]</em></span>)</code>: This returns the arrays of <code class="literal">Collider2D</code> which are all within the circle specified by the <code class="literal">radius</code> and <code class="literal">point</code> (the center of the circle) variables. In other words, it detects all the colliders that are within the specified circle. From the collider, it is possible to retrieve the game object itself as well. Our cupcake towers will use this function to detect how many enemies there are around. Furthermore, other optional parameters of the function are available to specify a mask of layers and the min and max values for the depth (<span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-axis) in which the function should search.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">OverlapCircle(Vector2 point, float radius, [<span class="emphasis"><em>optional parameters]</em></span>)</code>: The same function as before, but instead of returning the full array, it returns the first occurrence.

When the <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span> setting is disabled, the Physics engine just stops to perform calculations on it - it doesn't erase the object from the memory. As a result, when <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span> is checked back, the Physics engine has already all the objects/components in the memory and it doesn't' need to create them from scratch, thus leading to a performance improvement.</p><p>Of course, if you need to remove a rigidbody permanently from the scene, then just erase the component, because if you just uncheck <span class="strong"><strong>Simulate</strong></span>, the component will still be in memory, leading to a poor memory management.</p></div><div class="section" title="Physics Raycaster 2D component"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec73"/>Physics Raycaster 2D component</h2></div></div></div><p>Back in Chapter 3, <span class="emphasis"><em>Communicating with the Player – the User Interface</em></span>, we have seen the Unity UI system, and in the optional section there were the different components of a canvas.

This component checks if the player actually went over a slider or clicked a button, and then triggers events by exchanging messages with the event system.</p><p>If we have physics objects and we want to exchange events about them in a similar way the <span class="strong"><strong>Graphical Raycaster</strong></span> does for the UI, we can use a Physics Raycaster 2D component on a camera to handle such events.</p><p>Once this component is added, you can implement different interfaces in the scripts of your physics objects. As a result, the functions that they will implement will be automatically called when the corresponding event is triggered.</p><p>For instance, an event could be that a joint breaks, and you may want to run some code when this happens.

In particular, we will see how to detect when a sprinkle hits a panda and applies damage to it using the Physics engine.</p><div class="section" title="Set up Pandas as a rigidbodies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec75"/>Set up Pandas as a rigidbodies</h2></div></div></div><p>Since we will take advantage of the Physics engine, we need to proper set up the Panda as that to be a physical object in the scene. This means giving it a rigidbody component.</p><p>Therefore, we can start by adding a 
<span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody2D</strong></span> component to the Panda prefab, and set its 
<span class="strong"><strong>Body Type</strong></span> as 
<span class="strong"><strong>Kinematic</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00580.jpeg" alt="Set up Pandas as a rigidbodies"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>In theory, we should have done, since the Panda is considered a physical object now. However, in the previous chapter, we have written a function that allows the Panda to move by assigning its new position directly on its Transform. Since now the Panda has a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody2D</strong></span> component, we cannot do in this way anymore (as we already explained previously in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Rigidbodies</em></span> section). Therefore, we need to slightly modify the <code class="literal">PandaScript</code>. In particular, we need to get a reference to the rigidbody of the Panda, then use the <code class="literal">MovePosition()</code> function for Kinematic rigidbodies. Basically, we are applying what we have learnt in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Dealing with rigidbodies</em></span> section.</p><p>Hence, open the script, and add the following private variable:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Private variable to store the rigidbody2D</em></span>&#13;
private Rigidbody2D rb2D;</pre><p>Then, in the <code class="literal">Start()</code> function add this line at the end of the function:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Get the reference to the Rigidbody2d</em></span>&#13;
rb2D = GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody2D&gt;();</pre><p>In the <code class="literal">MoveTowards()</code> function, we need to use the <code class="literal">MovePosition()</code> function on the Panda's rigidbody to change its position. In addition, we shouldn't use <code class="literal">deltaTime</code> anymore, and substitute it with <code class="literal">fixedDeltaTime</code>. As such, here is highlighted what is changed from the previous chapter:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Function that based on the speed of the Panda makes it moving towards the destination point, specified as Vector3</em></span>&#13;
private void MoveTowards(Vector3 destination) {&#13;
<span class="emphasis"><em>  //Create a step and then move in towards destination of one step</em></span>&#13;
  float step = speed * <span class="strong"><strong>Time.fixedDeltaTime</strong></span>;&#13;
<span class="strong"><strong>  rb2D.MovePosition(</strong></span>Vector3.MoveTowards(transform.position,&#13;
    destination, step)<span class="strong"><strong>);&#13;
</strong></span>}</pre><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note88"/>Note</h3><p>We need to remember that the <code class="literal">MoveTowards()</code> function, now, should be called within a <code class="literal">FixedUpdate()</code> and not in the <code class="literal">Update()</code>. We will see this in <a class="ulink" href="https://cdp.packtpub.com/b03794gettingstartedwithunity2dgamedevelopmentsecondedition/wp-admin/post.php?post=220&amp;action=edit#post_247">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Trading Cupcakes and the Ultimate Battle for the Cake – Gameplay Programming</em></span>. But you can have an example in the next section.</p></div><p>Finally, we can save the script, and we have done with the Panda.</p></div><div class="section" title="Set up projectiles as rigidbodies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec76"/>Set up projectiles as rigidbodies</h2></div></div></div><p>Similar to what we did for the Pandas, we need to add a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody2D</strong></span> component to all the projectiles, and again set the <span class="strong"><strong>Body Type</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>Kinematic</strong></span>.</p><p>If you remember, also projectiles used to move by changing directly their Transforms, and we need to fix this, since they have a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody2D</strong></span> component as well.</p><p>Open the script, and as we did for the Pandas, add the following private variable:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="emphasis"><em>//Private variable to store the rigidbody2D</em></span>&#13;

<span class="emphasis"><em>//Get the reference to the Rigidbody2d</em></span>&#13;
rb2D = GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody2D&gt;();</pre><p>Now, we need to replace the <code class="literal">Update()</code> function with the <code class="literal">FixedUpdate()</code> one, since we are dealing with the Physics engine. Moreover, we need to slightly change the code (note also the use of the <code class="literal">fixedDeltaTime</code>):</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="emphasis"><em>// Update the position of the projectile according to time and speed</em></span>&#13;

}</pre><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note89"/>Note</h3><p>A careful reader would notice that we are applying the equation of motion explained in the information box within the <span class="emphasis"><em>Dealing with rigidbodies</em></span> section.

Then, you need to make one of them act as a Trigger, in our example we can take the Panda.</p><p>The next step is to implement the <code class="literal">OnTriggerEnter2D()</code> function, which is called from the Physics engine of Unity, on the <code class="literal">PandaScript</code>. As a result, we are able to detect when something hits the panda, and check if it is an actual sprinkle, so to apply damage to the panda with the <code class="literal">Hit()</code> function written in the previous chapter.</p><pre class="programlisting">

For both our Panda and the sprinkles, create within their scripts a check, when the game object is initialized, to add a <span class="strong"><strong>Rigidbody2D</strong></span> component, if missing, and set it to be <span class="strong"><strong>Kinematic</strong></span>. Additionally, you can print a warning message (See <a class="link" title="Chapter 8. What Is beyond the Cake?" href="part0100.xhtml#aid-2VBO82">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>What Is beyond the Cake?</em></span>, for more about debugging messages).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Passion for acceleration</strong></span>: In the chapter, we saw how we could implement motion equations for our <span class="strong"><strong>Kinematic</strong></span> rigidbodies.

Finally, reproduce what you have imagined within Unity, and tweak all the settings until it works as you have decided.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>A less dauntless Panda (Part III)</strong></span>: If you also completed the second part of this exercise back in <a class="link" title="Chapter 4. No Longer Alone – Sweet-Toothed Pandas Strike" href="part0056.xhtml#aid-1LCVG1">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>No Longer Alone - Sweet-Toothed Pandas Strike</em></span>, some pandas will be stunned, others not, depending on the Boolean value. Instead of exposing this Boolean within the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, add this property to the <code class="literal">Projectile</code> class, so that if the Panda is stunned or not depends on which kind of projectile the Panda was hit with (we will see this later in <a class="link" title="Chapter 6. Through a Sea of Sprinkles – Navigation in Artificial Intelligence" href="part0077.xhtml#aid-29DRA1">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Through a Sea of Sprinkles – Navigation in Artificial Intelligence</em></span>).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>A less dauntless Panda (Part IV)</strong></span>: After you have done part three of this exercise, if the poor panda is under attack with too many sprinkles, it might not move anymore because it is always in a stunned state.
