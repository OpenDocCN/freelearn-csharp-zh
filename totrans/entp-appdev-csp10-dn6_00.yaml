- en: .NET 6 is an open source, free, and full stack framework to write applications
    targeting any platform. The framework offers you the opportunity to write applications
    with ease, including for the cloud. As software developers, we are entrusted with
    the responsibility of building complex enterprise applications. In this book,
    we will learn about various advanced architectures and concepts for building enterprise
    applications using C# 10 and .NET 6.
