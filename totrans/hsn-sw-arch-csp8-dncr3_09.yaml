- en: Azure, like other clouds, offers a wide range of storage devices. The simplest
    approach is to define a scalable set of virtual machines hosted in the cloud where
    we can implement our custom solutions. For instance, we can create a SQL Server
    cluster on our cloud-hosted virtual machines to increase reliability and computational
    power. However, usually, custom architectures aren't the optimal solution and
    don't take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the cloud infrastructure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, this chapter will not discuss such custom architectures but will
    focus mainly on the various **Storage as a Service** (**SaaS**) offerings that
    are available in the cloud and, in particular, on Azure. These offers include
    scalable solutions based on plain disk space, relational databases, NoSQL databases,
    and in-memory data stores such as Redis.

- en: Choosing a more adequate storage type is based not only on the application's
    functional requirements but also on performance and scaling-out requirements.
    In fact, while scaling-out when processing resources causes a linear increase
    in performance, scaling-out storage resources doesn't necessarily imply an acceptable
    increase in performance. In a few words, no matter how much you duplicate your
    data storage devices, if several requests affect exactly the same chunk of data,
    they will always queue the same amount of time to access it!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scaling-out data causes linear increases of read operation throughput since
    each copy can serve a different request, but it doesn't imply the same increase
    in the throughput for write operations since all copies of the same chunk of data
    must be updated! Accordingly, more sophisticated techniques are required to scale-out
    storage devices, and not all storage engines scale equally well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In particular, relational databases don't scale well in all scenarios. Therefore,
    scaling needs and the need to distribute data geographically play a fundamental
    role in the choice of a storage engine, as well as in the choice of a SaaS offering.

- en: In NoSQL databases, relational tables are replaced with more general collections
    that can contain heterogeneous JSON objects. That is, collections have no predefined
    structure and no predefined fields with length constraints (in the case of strings)
    but can contain any type of object. The only structural constraint associated
    with each collection is the name of the property that acts as a primary key.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More specifically, each collection entry can contain nested objects and object
    collections nested in object properties, that is, related entities that, in relational
    databases, are contained in different tables and connected through external keys.
    In NoSQL, databases can be nested in their father entities. Since collection entries
    contain complex nested objects instead of simple property/value pairs, as is the
    case with relational databases, entries aren't called tuples or rows, but *documents*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No relations and/or external key constraints can be defined between documents
    that belong to the same collection or to different collections. If a document
    contains the primary key of another document in one of its properties, it does
    so at its own risk. The developer has the responsibility of maintaining and keeping
    these coherent references.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, since NoSQL storage is quite cheap, whole binary files can be stored
    as the values of document properties as Base64 strings. The developer can define
    rules to decide what properties to index in a collection. Since documents are
    nested objects, properties are actually tree paths. Usually, by default, all the
    paths are indexed, but you can specify which collection of paths and subpaths
    to index.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NoSQL databases are queried either with a subset of SQL or with a JSON-based
    language where queries are JSON objects whose paths represent the properties to
    query, and whose values represent the query constraints that have been applied
    to them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The possibility of nesting children objects inside documents can be simulated
    in relational databases with the help of one-to-many relationships. However, with
    relational databases, we are forced to redefine the exact structure of all the
    related tables, while NoSQL collections don't impose any predefined structure
    on the objects they contain. The only constraint is that each document must provide
    a unique value for the primary key property. Therefore, NoSQL databases are the
    only option when the structure of our objects is extremely variable. However,
    often they are chosen for the way they scale-out read and write operations and,
    more generally, for their performance advantages in distributed environments.
    Their performance features will be discussed in the next section, which compares
    them to relational databases.

    models were conceived to represent the features of people and the objects they

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Choosing between structured or NoSQL storage
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the previous section, we stated that NoSQL databases should be preferred
    when data has almost no predefined structure. Actually, unstructured data can
    be represented in relational databases since variable properties of a tuple, `t`,
    can be placed in a connected table containing the property name, property value,
    and the external key of `t`. However, the problem is performance. In fact, property
    values that belong to a single object would be spread all over the available memory
    space. In a small database, *all over the available memory space* means far away
    but on the same disk; in a bigger database, this means far away but in different
    disk units; in a distributed cloud environment, this means far away but in different –
    and possibly geographically distributed – servers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, NoSQL databases not only keep variable attributes close to
    their owners, but they also keep some related objects close since they allow related
    objects to be nested inside properties and collections.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, we can conclude that relational databases perform well when tables
    that are usually accessed together can be stored close in memory. NoSQL databases,
    on the other hand, automatically ensure that related data is kept close since
    each entry keeps most of the data it is related to inside it as nested objects.
    Therefore, NoSQL databases perform better when they are distributed to a different
    memory and also to different geographically distributed servers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, the only way to scale out storage write operations is to split
    collection entries across several servers according to the values of *shard keys*.
    For instance, we can place all the records containing usernames that start with
    A in a server, the records containing usernames that start with B on another server,
    and so on. This way, write operations for usernames with different start letters
    may be executed in parallel, ensuring that the write throughput increases linearly
    with the number of servers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, if a *shard* collection is related to several other collections, there
    is no guarantee that related records will be placed on the same server. Also,
    putting different collections on different servers without using collection sharding
    increases write throughput linearly until we reach the limit of a single collection
    per server, but it doesn't solve the issue of being forced to perform several
    operations on different servers to retrieve or update data that's usually processed
    together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This issue becomes catastrophic for performance if access to related distributed
    objects must be transactional and/or must ensure structural constraints (such
    as external key constraints) aren't violated. In this case, all related objects
    must be blocked during the transaction, preventing other requests from accessing
    them during the whole lifetime of a time-consuming distributed operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NoSQL databases don't suffer from this problem and perform better with sharding
    and consequently with write-scaled output. This is because they don't distribute
    related data to different storage units and instead store them as nested objects
    of the same database entry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In NoSQL database design, we always try to put all related objects that are
    likely to be processed together into a single entry. Related objects that are
    accessed less frequently are placed in different entries. Since external key constraints
    aren't enforced automatically and NoSQL transactions are very flexible, the developer
    can choose the best compromise between performance and coherence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is worth mentioning that there are situations where relational databases
    perform well with sharding. A typical instance is a multi-tenant application.
    In a multi-tenant application, all entries collections can be partitioned into
    non-overlapping sets called **tenants**. Only entries belonging to the same tenant
    can refer to each other, so if all the collections are sharded in the same way
    according to their object tenants, all related records end up in the same shard,
    that is, in the same server, and can be navigated efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Multi-tenant applications aren't rare in the cloud since all applications that
    offer the same services to several different users are often implemented as multi-tenant
    applications, where each tenant corresponds to a user subscription. Accordingly,
    relational databases are conceived to work in the cloud, such as Azure SQL Server,
    and usually offer sharding options for multi-tenant applications. Typically, sharding
    isn't a cloud service and must be defined with database engine commands. Here,
    we won't describe how to define shards with Azure SQL Server, but the *Further
    reading* section contains a link to the official Microsoft documentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In conclusion, relational databases offer a pure, logical view of data that's
    independent of the way they are actually stored, and use a declarative language
    to query and update them. This simplifies development and system maintenance,
    but it may cause performance issues in a distributed environment that requires
    write scale-out. In NoSQL databases, you must handle more details about how to
    store data, as well as some procedural details for all the update and query operations,
    manually, but this allows you to optimize performance in distributed environments
    that require both read and write scale-out.
