<p class="mce-root">This section introduces you to the tools included in the main modern cloud platforms. The focus is on Microsoft Azure, which has the most flexible and diverse offerings. </p>
<p><a href="049a0a4b-74b6-41a1-92db-87a4f8af9fd1.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>,  <em>Deciding the Best Cloud-Based Solution</em>, is a general introduction to the cloud and Azure. There, you find all relevant cloud concepts and a description of the overall Azure offering, together with examples that show how you can configure resources in the cloud to meet your needs. <a href="49aed8bb-9a4a-4241-9efc-f53c3f53dd5a.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Applying a Microservice Architecture to Your Enterprise Application</em>, describes the microservice computational model, which is the most efficacious way to achieve flexibility, high throughput, and reliability in the cloud. There, you can learn also about containers and Docker, which will enable you to mix different technologies in your architecture and to make your software platform-independent.</p>
<p><a href="8c8a9dbc-3bfc-4291-866f-fdd1a62c16ef.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Interacting with Data in C# - Entity Framework Core</em>, and <a href="77cdecb5-cef4-4b02-80a1-052ad366b9f3.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>How to Choose Your Data Storage in the Cloud</em>, describes Azure's main storage offerings and how to use them. There, you can learn the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to choose the best storage solutions for each subsystem of your architecture</li>
<li>How to configure storage solutions to achieve the read/write parallelism you need</li>
<li>How to integrate all these into your software</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally,  in <a href="2b061d97-54d8-4a0b-b325-95c056c0348a.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Working with Azure Functions</em>, you will learn about the serverless model of computation, which is included in all main cloud offerings, and understand how to use it in the Azure cloud. Thanks to serverless, you can run your computations just when they are needed without preallocating cloud resources, and you can do so while paying only for the actual computation time.</p>
