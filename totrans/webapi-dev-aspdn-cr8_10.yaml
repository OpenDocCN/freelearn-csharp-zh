- en: In [*Chapter 9*](B18971_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor371), we learned how to write
    unit tests for a ASP.NET Core web API application. Unit tests are used to test
    code units in isolation. However, a code unit often depends on other components,
    such as the database, external services, and so on. To test the code thoroughly,
    we need to test the code units in the context of the application. In other words,
    we need to test how the code units interact with other parts of the application.
    This type of testing is called integration testing.

    the interactions between components. These integration tests may involve different
    layers, such as the database, the file system, the network, the HTTP request/response
    pipeline and so on. Integration tests ensure that the components of the application
    work together as expected. So, normally, integration tests use actual dependencies
    instead of mocks. Also, integration tests are slower than unit tests because they
    involve more components. Considering the cost of integration tests, we do not
    need to write too many integration tests. Instead, we should focus on the critical
    parts of the application. Most of the time, we can use unit tests to cover the
    other parts.

    to handle the HTTP requests. The benefit of using a test web host is that we can
    use a different configuration for the test environment, and it also saves the
    network traffic because the HTTP requests are handled in the same process. So,
    the tests using a test web host are faster than those using a real web host. To
    use the test web host, we need to add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` NuGet

    the default database context using `services.SingleOrDefault(d => d.ServiceType
