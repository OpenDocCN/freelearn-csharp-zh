    <h1 id="_idParaDest-248" class="chapterTitle">Performance Wizardry: Optimizing Your Game with Profiler Tools</h1>
    <p class="normal">Welcome to the fourth part of this book—I am glad you have reached this part as it means that you have almost completed a full game! So far, we have developed a game while focusing on implementing different gameplay features and effects, but we didn’t consider how well they were performing in terms of our game’s <strong class="keyWord">frames per second</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">FPS</strong>). In this chapter, we are going to discuss optimization techniques to review your game’s performance and improve it, as having a good and constant frame rate is vital to any game.</p>
    <p class="normal">Performance is a broad topic that requires a deep understanding of several Unity systems and could span several books. We are going to look at how to measure performance and explore the effects of our changes to systems to learn how they work through testing.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we will examine the following performance concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Optimizing graphics</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Optimizing processing</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Optimizing memory</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to gather performance data on the three main pieces of hardware that run your game—the GPU, CPU, and RAM. You will be able to analyze that data to detect possible performance issues and understand how to solve the most common ones.</p>
    <p class="normal">We will start by learning how to optimize the graphics side of our game.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-249" class="heading-1">Optimizing graphics</h1>
    <p class="normal">The most common<a id="_idIndexMarker1249"/> cause of performance issues is related to the misuse of assets, especially on the graphics side, due to not having enough knowledge of how Unity’s graphics engines work. We are going to explore how a GPU works at a high level and how to improve its usage.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will examine the following graphics optimization concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Introduction to graphics engines</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Using Frame Debugger</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Using batching</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Other optimizations</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">We will start by looking at a high-level overview of how graphics are rendered to better understand the performance data that we will gather later in Frame Debugger. Based on the debugger’s results, we are going to identify the areas where we can apply <strong class="screenText">batching</strong> (which is a technique to combine the rendering process of several objects, reducing its cost), along with other common optimizations to keep in mind.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-250" class="heading-2">Introduction to graphics engines</h2>
    <p class="normal">Nowadays, every gaming <a id="_idIndexMarker1250"/>device, whether it is a computer, a mobile device, or a console, has a video card—a set of hardware that specializes in graphics processing. It differs from a CPU in a subtle but important way. Graphics processing involves the processing of thousands of mesh vertices and the rendering of millions of pixels in a single frame. This is in charge of calculating the color and lighting of your objects’ pixels and moving and animating your objects’ geometry. The GPU is designed to run short programs a massive number of times, while the CPU can handle programs of any length but with limited parallelization capabilities. The reason for having those processing units (CPU and GPU) is so that our program can use each one when needed.</p>
    <p class="normal">The problem here is that graphics don’t just rely on the GPU. The CPU is also involved in the process, making calculations and issuing commands to the GPU, so they must work together. For that to happen, both processing units need to communicate, and because they are (usually) physically separated, they need another piece of hardware to allow this: a bus, with the most common type <a id="_idIndexMarker1251"/>being the <strong class="keyWord">Peripheral Component Interconnect Express</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">PCI Express</strong>) bus.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">PCI</strong> <strong class="keyWord">Express</strong> is a type of connection that allows massive amounts of data to be moved between the GPU and CPU, but the problem is that even if it’s very fast, the communication time can be noticeable if you issue a lot of commands between both units. So, the key concept here is that graphics performance is improved mainly by reducing the communications<a id="_idIndexMarker1252"/> between the GPU and CPU:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_01_PE.png" alt="A picture containing text, font, screenshot, line  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.1: CPU/GPU communication through a PCI Express bus</p>
    <p class="normal">Nowadays, new hardware architecture allows the CPU and GPU to coexist in the same chipset, reducing communication time and even sharing memory. Sadly, that architecture doesn’t allow the processing power needed for video games, as having those two pieces separated allows them to have enough space for a large number of cores.</p>
    <p class="normal">The basic responsibility of a graphics engine is to determine which objects are visible using culling algorithms, sorting and grouping them according to their similarities, and then issuing drawing commands to the GPU to render those groups of objects, sometimes more than once. The main form of <a id="_idIndexMarker1253"/>communication between the CPU and GPU is the <strong class="screenText">drawing commands</strong>, usually called <strong class="screenText">draw calls</strong>, and our main task when optimizing graphics is to reduce them as much as we can. The problem is that there are several sources of draw calls that need to be considered, such as the lighting or certain special effects. Studying <a id="_idIndexMarker1254"/>every single one of them will take a long time, and even so, new versions of Unity can introduce new graphics features with their own draw calls. Instead, we will explore a way to discover these draw calls using Frame Debugger.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-251" class="heading-2">Using Frame Debugger</h2>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">Frame Debugger</strong> is a tool that <a id="_idIndexMarker1255"/>allows us to see a list of all the draw calls that the Unity rendering engine sends to the GPU. It not only lists them but also provides information about each draw call, including the data needed to detect optimization opportunities. By using Frame Debugger, we can see how our changes modify the number of draw calls, giving us immediate feedback on our efforts.</p>
    <p class="normal">Note that reducing draw calls is sometimes not enough to improve performance, as each draw call can have different processing times, but usually, that difference is not big enough to consider. Also, in certain special rendering techniques, such as ray tracing or ray marching, a single draw call can drain all of our GPU power. This won’t be the case in our game, so we won’t take that into account right now.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s use Frame Debugger to analyze the rendering process of our game by doing the following:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Open Frame Debugger (<strong class="screenText">Window | Analysis | Frame Debugger</strong>).</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Play the game, and when you want to analyze the performance, click the <strong class="screenText">Enable</strong> button in the top-left corner of Frame Debugger (press <em class="keystroke">Esc</em> to regain control of the mouse while playing):</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.2: Enabling Frame Debugger</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="3">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Game</strong> tab to open the <strong class="screenText">Game</strong> view.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Drag the slider to the right of the <strong class="screenText">Disable</strong> button slowly from left to right to see how the scene is rendered. Each step is a draw call that is being executed in the CPU for that given game frame. You can also observe how the list in the left part of the window highlights the name of the executed draw call at that moment:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_03_PE.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.3: Analyzing our frame’s draw calls</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="5">If some of the draw calls in the list output a gray image in the <strong class="screenText">Game</strong> panel, alongside a warning in the console, a temporary fix for this is selecting your scene’s main camera and setting the <strong class="screenText">MSAA</strong> property in the <strong class="screenText">Output</strong> section of its <strong class="screenText">Camera</strong> component to <strong class="screenText">Off</strong>. Remember to revert this change afterward using Frame Debugger.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click on any<a id="_idIndexMarker1256"/> draw call from the list and observe the details in the right part of the window.
    <p class="normal">Most of them can be confusing to you if you are not used to coding engines or shaders, but you can see that some of them have a human-readable part that says why this draw call can’t be batched with the previous one, which tells you why two objects weren’t drawn together in a single draw call. We will examine those reasons later:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_04.png" alt="Text  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.4: The batching break reasons in Frame Debugger</p></li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="7">With the window open in <strong class="screenText">Play</strong> mode, disable the terrain and see how the amount of draw calls changes immediately. Sometimes, just turning objects on and off can be enough to detect what is causing performance issues. Also, try disabling post-processing and other graphics-related objects, such as particles.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Even if we are not fully aware of where each one of these draw calls came from, we can at least start by modifying the settings throughout Unity to see the impact of those changes. There’s no better way of discovering how something as massive as Unity works than going through every toggle and seeing the impact of those changes through a measuring tool. Of course, sometimes we just need to pay the price of certain draw calls to achieve certain effects, like in the case of the terrain, although you can always wonder whether it’s worth it or not; that would require a case-by-case analysis.</p>
    <p class="normal">Even if Frame Debugger <a id="_idIndexMarker1257"/>gives us lots of info, sometimes you can take an extra step and use more advanced tools, like RenderDoc or NVIDIA Nsight, some of which work similarly to Frame Debugger in the sense that they show all the draw calls but also show info like the timings of each draw call, meshes, shaders, textures being used by each one of them, and much more.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, let’s discuss the basic techniques for reducing draw calls and see their effects in Frame Debugger.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-252" class="heading-2">Using batching</h2>
    <p class="normal">We discussed several<a id="_idIndexMarker1258"/> optimization techniques in previous chapters, with lighting being the most important one. If you measure the draw calls as you implement the techniques, you will notice the impact of those actions on the draw call count. However, in this section, we will focus on another graphics optimization technique known as batching. <strong class="screenText">Batching</strong> is the process of grouping several objects to draw them together in a single draw call.</p>
    <p class="normal">You may be wondering why we can’t just draw everything in a single draw call, and while that is technically possible, there is a set of conditions that need to be met in order to combine two objects, with the usual case being combining materials.</p>
    <p class="normal">Remember that materials act as graphic presets, specifying a <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> mode or shader and a set of parameters to customize the aspect of our objects, like the object’s color and texture. If Unity has to draw an object with a different material than the previous one, a <code class="inlineCode">SetPass</code> call needs to be called before issuing its draw call, which is another form of CPU/GPU communication used to set the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> properties in the GPU, such as its textures and colors. If two objects use the same materials, this step can be skipped. The <code class="inlineCode">SetPass</code> call from the first object is reused by the second, and that opens the opportunity to batch the objects. If they share the same settings, Unity can combine the meshes into a single one in the CPU, and then send the combined mesh in a single draw call to the GPU.</p>
    <p class="normal">There are several <a id="_idIndexMarker1259"/>ways to reduce the number of materials, such as removing duplicates, but the most effective way is through a concept called <strong class="screenText">texture atlasing</strong>. This means merging textures from different objects into a single one. This way, several objects can use the same material due to the fact that the texture used there can be applied to several objects and an object that has its own texture requires its own material. Sadly, there’s no automatic system in Unity to combine the textures of three-dimensional objects, such as the Texture Atlas<strong class="screenText"> </strong>object we used in 2D. There are probably some systems in the Asset Store, but automatic systems can have several side effects. </p>
    <p class="normal">This work is usually done by an artist, so just keep this technique in mind when working with a dedicated 3D artist (or if you are your own artist):</p>

      <li class="numberedList">Use one of the materials on both cubes and look at the list again. You will notice that now we just have one <strong class="screenText">Draw Mesh Cube </strong>call. You might need to disable and enable Frame Debugger again for it to refresh properly if you are not playing the game.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Now, I challenge you to try the same steps but create spheres instead of cubes. While performing this challenge, note your observations and hypotheses about why the results differ between cubes and spheres. If you do that, you will probably notice that even with the same materials, the spheres are not batched! Here is where we need to introduce the concept of <strong class="screenText">dynamic batching</strong>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Remember that GameObjects have a <strong class="screenText">Static</strong> checkbox, which serves to notify several Unity systems that the object won’t move so that they can apply several optimizations. Objects that don’t have this checkbox checked are considered dynamic. So far, the cubes and spheres we used for our tests have been dynamic, so Unity needed to combine them in every frame because they can move, and combining is not “free.” Its cost is associated directly with the number of vertices in the model. </p>
    <p class="normal">You can get the exact numbers and all the required considerations from the Unity manual, which will appear if you search for <code class="inlineCode">Unity Batching</code> on the internet, or they can be accessed with this link: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DrawCallBatching.html"><span class="url">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DrawCallBatching.html</span></a>. However, it is enough to say that if the number of vertices of an object is big enough, that object won’t be batched, and doing so would require more than issuing two draw calls. That’s why our spheres weren’t batched; a sphere has too many vertices.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, things are different if we have static objects because they use a second batching system—the <strong class="screenText">static batcher</strong>. The <a id="_idIndexMarker1263"/>concept of this is the same. Merge objects to render them in one draw call, and again, these objects need to share the same material. The main difference is that this batcher will batch more objects than the dynamic batcher because the merging is done once at the time that the scene loads and is then saved in memory to use in the next frames, costing memory but saving lots of processing time with each frame. You can use the same approach as we used to test the dynamic batcher to test the <a id="_idIndexMarker1264"/>static version just by checking the <strong class="screenText">Static</strong> checkbox of the spheres this time and seeing the result in <strong class="screenText">Play</strong> mode; in <strong class="screenText">Edition</strong> mode (when it is not playing), the static batcher won’t work:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.10: A static sphere and its static batch</p>
    <p class="normal">Before moving on, let’s discuss why we disabled SRP Batcher and how that changes what we just discussed. In its 2020 edition, Unity introduced the <strong class="screenText">Universal Render Pipeline </strong>(<strong class="screenText">URP</strong>), a new render pipeline.</p>
    <p class="normal">Along with several improvements, one that is relevant right now is SRP Batcher, a new batcher that works on dynamic objects with no vertex or material limits (but with other limits). Instead of relying on sharing the same material with batch objects, SRP Batcher can have a batch of objects with materials that use the same shader, meaning we can have, for example, 100 objects with 100 different materials for each one, and they will be batched regardless of the<a id="_idIndexMarker1265"/> number of vertices, as long as the material uses the same shader and variant:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_11_PE.png" alt="A picture containing text, sign, screenshot  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.11: GPU data persistence for materials, which allows SRP Batcher to exist</p>
    <p class="normal">One shader can have several versions or variants, and the selected variant is chosen based on the settings. We can have a shader that doesn’t use normal mapping and a variant that doesn’t calculate normals will be used, so that can affect SRP Batcher. So, there’s basically no drawback to using SRP Batcher, so go ahead and turn it on again. Try creating lots of spheres with as many materials as you can and check the number of batches it will generate in Frame Debugger. Just consider that if you need to work on a project done in a pre-URP era, this won’t be available, so you will need to know the proper batching strategy to use.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-253" class="heading-2">Other optimizations</h2>
    <p class="normal">As mentioned before, there are lots<a id="_idIndexMarker1266"/> of possible graphics optimizations, so let’s discuss briefly the basic ones, starting with <strong class="screenText">Level of Detail</strong> (<strong class="screenText">LOD</strong>). LOD<a id="_idIndexMarker1267"/> is the process of changing the mesh of an object based on its distance to the camera. This can reduce draw calls if you replace, for example, a house with several parts and pieces with a single combined mesh with reduced detail when the house is far away. Another benefit of using LOD is that you reduce the cost of a draw call because of the reduction in the vertex count.</p>
    <p class="normal">To use this feature, do the following:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Create an empty <a id="_idIndexMarker1268"/>object and parent the two versions of the model. You need to use models that have several versions with different levels of detail, but for now, we are just going to test this feature using a cube and a sphere:</li>
    </ol>

You can add <a id="_idIndexMarker1270"/>as many mesh renderers as you want.</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.14: Adding renderers to LOD groups</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="5">Select <strong class="screenText">LOD 1</strong> and add the cube.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Drag the line between the two groups to control the distance range that each group will occupy. As you drag it, you will see a preview of how far the camera needs to be to switch groups. Also, you have the <strong class="screenText">Culled</strong> group, which is the distance from where the camera will not render any group.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Just move around the scene in the <strong class="screenText">Scene</strong> panel to see how the meshes are swapped.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Something to consider here is that the colliders of the objects won’t be disabled, so just have the renderers in the LOD sub-objects. Put the collider with the shape of <a id="_idIndexMarker1271"/>LOD 0 in the parent object, or just remove the colliders from the LOD group objects, except group 0.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Another optimization to consider<a id="_idIndexMarker1272"/> is <strong class="screenText">frustum culling</strong>. By default, Unity will render any object that falls into the view area or frustum of the camera, skipping the ones that don’t. The algorithm is cheap enough to always use, and there’s no way to disable it. However, it does have a flaw. If we have a wall hiding all the objects behind it, even if they are occluded, they fall inside the frustum, so they will be rendered anyway. Detecting whether every pixel of a mesh occludes every pixel of the other mesh is almost impossible to do in real time, but luckily, we have a workaround: occlusion culling.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">Occlusion culling</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1273"/>process that analyzes a scene and determines which objects can be seen in different parts of the scene, dividing them into sectors and analyzing each one. As this process can take quite a long time, it is done in the editor, similar to lightmapping. As you can imagine, it only works on static objects given that it’s calculated in editor time. To use it, do the following:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Mark the objects that<a id="_idIndexMarker1274"/> shouldn’t move as static, or if you only want this object to be considered static for the occlusion culling system, check the <strong class="screenText">Occluder Static</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Occludee Static</strong> checkboxes of the arrow to the right of the <strong class="screenText">Static</strong> checkbox. Occluder means that the object can occlude other objects, and occludee means that this object can be occluded by other occluder objects. We are setting out objects to occlude and be occluded likewise.
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">For extra performance, you might want to think about which objects are occluders and which ones occludees. Small objects are unlikely to occlude other objects, so it might be worth not checking the occluder flag on those. Likewise, big objects that might not get occluded at all depending on your scene’s setup might be good candidates to not be occludees.</p>
    </div></li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">

    <p class="normal">Take into account that if you<a id="_idIndexMarker1275"/> move the camera outside the calculated area, the process won’t take place, and Unity will only calculate areas near the static objects. You can extend the calculation area by creating an empty object and adding an <strong class="screenText">Occlusion Area</strong> component, setting its position and size to cover the area that the camera will reach, and, finally, rebaking the culling. Try to be sensible with the size of the cube. The larger the area to calculate, the larger the space needed in your disk to store the generated data.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can use several of these areas to be more precise—for example, in an L-shaped scene, you can use two of them:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.16: Occlusion Area</p>
    <p class="normal">If you see that the objects are not being occluded, it can be that the occluder object (the wall in this case) is not big enough to be considered. You can increase the size of the object or reduce the <strong class="screenText">Smallest Occluder</strong> setting in the <strong class="screenText">Bake</strong> tab of the window. Doing that will subdivide the scene further to detect small occluders, but that will take more space in the disk to store more data. So again, be sensible with this setting.</p>
    <p class="normal">There are still some more techniques that we can apply to our game, but the ones we have discussed are enough for our game. So, in this section, we learned about the process of rendering graphics in a video card, the concept of batches, how to profile them to know exactly how many of them we have and what they are doing, and finally, how to reduce them as much as we can. Now, let’s start discussing other optimization areas, such as the processing area.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-254" class="heading-1">Optimizing processing</h1>
    <p class="normal">While graphics usually <a id="_idIndexMarker1276"/>take up most of the time that a frame needs to be generated, we should never underestimate the cost of badly optimized code and scenes. There are several parts of the game that are still calculated in the CPU, including part of the graphics process (such as the batching calculations), physics, audio, and our code. Here, we have a lot more causes of performance issues than on the graphics side, so again, instead of discussing every optimization, let’s learn how to discover them.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will examine the following CPU optimization concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Detecting CPU- and GPU-bound</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Using the <strong class="keyWord">CPU Usage</strong> Profiler</li>
      <li class="bulletList">General CPU optimization techniques</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">We will start by discussing the concepts of CPU- and GPU-bound, which focus on the optimization process, determining whether the problem is GPU- or CPU-related. Later, as with the GPU optimization process, we will look at how to gather the performance data of the CPU and interpret it to detect possible optimization techniques to be applied.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-255" class="heading-2">Detecting CPU- and GPU-bound</h2>
    <p class="normal">As with Frame Debugger, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1277"/>Unity Profiler allows us to gather data about the performance of our game through a series of Profiler modules, each one designed to gather data about different Unity systems per frame, such as physics, audio, and, most importantly, <strong class="screenText">CPU usage</strong>. This last module allows us to see the most important operations that Unity executed to process the frame—which range from our scripts to systems such as physics and graphics (the CPU part).</p>
    <p class="normal">Before exploring the <strong class="screenText">CPU usage</strong>, one important bit of data that we can gather in this module is whether we are CPU- or GPU-bound. As explained before, a frame is processed using both the CPU and GPU, and those pieces of hardware can work in parallel. While the GPU is executing a frame’s drawing commands, the CPU can execute the next frame physics, our scripts, and other non-graphic processes in a very efficient way. But now, let’s say that the CPU finishes that work while the GPU is still working on the previous frame. Can the CPU start to work on the next frame graphics processing? The answer is no. This would lead to a de-synchronization, so in this scenario, the CPU will need to wait. This wait is not necessarily bad if your game is already running at the desired frame rate (usually 60 fps), but if it isn’t, your game’s performance is limited or bound. The case we described about the CPU waiting for the GPU is known as GPU-bound, and we also have the opposite case, CPU-bound, when the GPU finishes earlier than the CPU. While the CPU and the GPU work in parallel, there’s a moment where the CPU needs the GPU but it is busy, and vice versa, leading to waiting times that are just a waste of the hardware capabilities.</p>
    <p class="normal">It is important to concentrate our optimization efforts, so if we detect that our game is GPU-bound, we will focus on GPU graphics optimization (like reduction of mesh and shader complexity), and if it is <a id="_idIndexMarker1278"/>CPU-bound, then we will focus on the rest of the systems and the CPU side of graphics processing. To detect whether our game is one or the other, do the following:</p>

In the preceding screenshot, you can see that my screen displays <strong class="screenText">0.00,</strong> while the CPU is taking <strong class="screenText">6.42ms</strong> and the GPU is taking <strong class="screenText">2.17ms</strong>. So, my device is CPU-bound, but consider your device and project can bring different results.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Now that we can detect whether we are CPU- or GPU-bound, we can focus our optimization efforts, either on CPU-side optimizations or GPU-side. So far, we have discussed how to profile and optimize part of the GPU process in the <em class="italic">Optimizing graphics</em> section. Now, if we detect that we are CPU-bound, let’s see how to profile the CPU.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-256" class="heading-2">Using the CPU Usage Profiler</h2>
    <p class="normal">Profiling the CPU is done<a id="_idIndexMarker1281"/> in a similar way to profiling the GPU. We need to get a list of actions the CPU executes and try to reduce the number of them, or at least reduce their cost. Here is where the <strong class="screenText">CPU Usage Profiler</strong> module comes in—a tool that allows us to see all the instructions that the CPU executed in one frame. The main difference is that the GPU mostly executes draw calls, and we have a few types of them, while the CPU can have hundreds of different instructions to execute, and sometimes some of them cannot be deleted, such as physics or audio processing. In these scenarios, we are looking to reduce the cost of these functions so that they do not consume too much time. So, again, an important note here is to detect which function is taking too much time and then reduce its cost or remove it, which requires a deeper understanding of the underlying system. Let’s start detecting the function first.</p>
    <p class="normal">When you play the game with the <strong class="screenText">Profiler</strong> tab open, you will see a series of graphics showing the performance of your game, and in the <strong class="screenText">CPU Usage</strong> profiler, you will see that the graphic is split into different colors, each one referring to different parts of frame processing. You can check the information to the left of the Profiler to see what each color means, but let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1282"/>discuss the most important ones.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Check the following Unity manual page to see how to enable color blind modes for the profiler: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.1/Documentation/Manual/ProfilerWindow.html"><span class="url">https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.1/Documentation/Manual/ProfilerWindow.html</span></a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">In the following screenshot, you can see how the graphic should look:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_22.png" alt="Chart  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.22: Analyzing the CPU Usage graph</p>
    <p class="normal">If you see the graphic, you will probably assume that the dark green part of the graph is taking up most of the performance time, and while that is true, you can also see from the legend that dark green means <strong class="screenText">Others</strong>, and that’s because we are profiling the game in the Editor. The editor won’t behave exactly like the final game. In order for it to run, it has to do lots of extra processing that won’t be executed in the game, so the best you can do is profile directly in the build of the game. There, you will gather more accurate data. We are going to discuss how to do builds in the next chapter, so for now, we can ignore that area. What we can do now is simply click on the colored square to the left of the <strong class="screenText">Others</strong> label to disable that measurement from the graph in order to clean it up a little bit. If you also see a large section of yellow, it refers to <strong class="screenText">VSync</strong>, which is basically the time spent waiting for our processing to match the monitor’s refresh rate. This is also something that we can ignore, so you should also disable it. In the next screenshot, you can check the graphic<a id="_idIndexMarker1283"/> color categories and how to disable them:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_23.png" alt="Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.23: Disabling VSync and Others from the Profiler</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have cleaned up the graph, we can get a good idea of our game’s potential frame rate by looking at the line with the <strong class="screenText">ms</strong> label (in our case, <strong class="screenText">5ms (200FPS)</strong>), which indicates that frames below that line have more than 200 FPS, and frames above that line have less.</p>
    <p class="normal">In my case, I have excellent performance, but remember, I am testing this on a powerful machine. The best way to profile is not only in the build of the game (as an executable) but also in the target device, which should be the lowest-spec hardware we intend our game to run on. Our target device depends a lot on the target audience of the game. If we are making a casual game, we are probably targeting mobile devices, so we should test the game on the lowest-spec phone we can, but if we are targeting hardcore gamers, they will probably have a powerful machine to run our game on.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you are targeting hardcore gamers, of course, this doesn’t mean that we can just make a very unoptimized game because of that, but it will give us enough processing space to add more detail. Anyway, I strongly recommend you avoid those kinds of games if you are a beginner as they are more difficult to develop, which you will probably realize. Stick to simple games to begin with.</p>
    <p class="normal">Looking at the graphics colors, you can observe the cost on the CPU side of rendering in light green, which the graph shows is taking up a significant portion of the processing time, which is actually normal. Then, in blue, we can see the cost of our scripts’ and other systems’ execution, which is also taking up a significant portion, but again, this is quite normal. Also, we can observe a little bit of orange, which is physics, and also a little bit of light blue, which is animations. Remember to check the colored labels in the Profiler to remember which color refers to what.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, those colored bars represent a group of operations, so if we consider the <strong class="screenText">Rendering</strong> bar to be representing 10 operations, how do we know which operations that includes? Also, how do we know which of these operations is taking up the most performance time? Out of those 10 operations, a single one could be causing these issues. Here is where the bottom part of the profiler is useful. It shows a list of all the functions being <a id="_idIndexMarker1284"/>called in the frame. To use it, do the following:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Click any part of the <strong class="screenText">CPU Usage</strong> section in the Profiler and check that the button at the top-left part of the bottom bar of the Profiler says <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong>. If not (for example, if it says <strong class="screenText">Timeline</strong>), click it and select <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Clear the search bar we used earlier. It will filter function calls by name, and we want to see them all.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Time ms</strong> column until you see an arrow pointing downward. This will order the calls by cost in descending order.</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_24.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.24: The profiler Time ms column</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="4">Click on a frame that catches your attention in the graph—probably one of the ones with the biggest height that consumes more processing time. This will make the Profiler stop the game straight away and show you information about that frame.
    <p class="normal">There are two things to consider when looking at the graph. If you see peaks that are significantly higher than the rest of the frames, that can cause a hiccup in your game—a very brief moment where the game is frozen—which can break the performance. Also, you can look for a long series of frames with higher time consumption. Try to reduce them as well. Even if this is only temporary, the impact of it will be easily perceived by the player, especially in VR games, as that could induce nausea.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="5"><strong class="screenText">PlayerLoop</strong> will probably appear as the most time-consuming frame, but that’s not very informative. You can explore it further by expanding it by clicking on the arrow to its left.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click on each <a id="_idIndexMarker1285"/>function to highlight it in the graph. Functions with higher processing times will be highlighted with thicker bars, and those are the ones we will focus on:</li>

    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="7">You can keep clicking on the arrows to further explore the functions until you hit a limit. If you want to go deeper, enable the <strong class="screenText">Deep Profile</strong> mode in the top bar of the Profiler. This will give you more details, but take into account that this process is expensive and will make the game go slower, altering the time shown in the graph, and making it appear much higher than the real time. Here, ignore the numbers and look at how much of the process a function is taking up based on the graph. You will need to stop, enable <strong class="screenText">Deep Profile</strong>, and play it again to make it work:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.26: Enabling Deep Profile</p>
    <p class="normal">With this knowledge, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1286"/>can start improving our game performance (if it’s below the target frame rate), but each function is called by the CPU and is improved in its own unique way, which requires greater knowledge about Unity’s internal workings. That could span several books, and anyway, the internals change on a version-to-version basis. Instead, you could study how each function works by looking up data about that specific system on the internet and official documentation, or again, by just disabling and enabling objects or parts of our code to explore the impact of our actions, as we did with Frame Debugger. </p>
    <p class="normal">Profiling requires creativity and inference to interpret and react accordingly to the data obtained, so you will need some patience here.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have discussed how to get the profiling data relating to the CPU, let’s discuss some common ways to reduce <strong class="screenText">CPU usage</strong>.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-257" class="heading-2">General CPU optimization techniques</h2>
    <p class="normal">In terms of CPU <a id="_idIndexMarker1287"/>optimization, there are lots of possible causes of high performance, including the abuse of Unity’s features, a large number of physics or audio objects, improper asset/object configurations, and so on. Our scripts can also be coded in an unoptimized way, abusing or misusing expensive Unity API functions. So far, we have discussed several good practices of using Unity systems, such as audio configurations, texture sizes, batching, and finding functions such as <code class="inlineCode">GameObject.Find</code> and replacing them with managers. So, let’s discuss some specific details about common cases.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by seeing how a large amount of objects impacts our performance. Here, you can just create lots of objects with <code class="inlineCode">Rigidbody</code> (at least 200) configured in <strong class="screenText">Dynamic Profile</strong>, and observe the results in the Profiler.</p>
    <p class="normal">You will notice, in the following screenshot, how the orange part of the profiler just got bigger and that the <code class="inlineCode">Physics.RunSimulationStage</code> function is responsible for this increase:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_27.png" alt="A picture containing table  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.27: The Physics processing of several objects</p>
    <p class="normal">Remember that the Profiler<a id="_idIndexMarker1288"/> has other modules that you can activate by clicking the <strong class="screenText">Profiler Modules</strong> button, and there’s one for physics. Consider enabling it and checking the info it gives you. Also check the official documentation for the profiler for more info on those modules.</p>
    <p class="normal">Another test to see the <a id="_idIndexMarker1289"/>impact of several objects could be creating lots of audio sources. In the following screenshot, you can see that we needed to re-enable <strong class="screenText">Others</strong> because part of the audio processing comes under that category. We mentioned earlier that <strong class="screenText">Others</strong> belongs to the editor, but it can encompass other processes as well, so keep that in mind:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_28.png" alt="Chart  Description automatically generated with low confidence"/></figure>
    <figure class="mediaobject">Figure 18.28: The audio processing of several audio sources</figure>
    <p class="normal">So, to discover these <a id="_idIndexMarker1290"/>kinds of problems, you can just start disabling and enabling objects and see whether they increase the time or not. A final test is on particles. Create a system that spawns a big enough number of particles to affect our frame rate and check the Profiler.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the following screenshot, you can check how the particle processing function is highlighted in the graph, showing that it takes a large amount of time:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_29_PE.png" alt="Timeline  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.29: Particle processing</p>
    <p class="normal">Then, on the scripting side, we have other kinds of things to consider, some of which are common to all programming languages and platforms, such as iterating long lists of objects, the misuse of data structures, and deep recursion. However, in this section, I will mainly be discussing Unity-specific APIs, starting with <code class="inlineCode">print</code> or <code class="inlineCode">Debug.Log</code>.</p>
    <p class="normal">This function is useful to get debugging information in the console, but it can also be costly because all logs are written onto the disk immediately to avoid losing valuable information if our game crashes. Disk writes are a very slow operation, even if using SSDs, so we want to avoid them as much as possible. Of course, we also want to keep those valuable logs in the game but we don’t want it to affect the performance, so what can we do?</p>
    <p class="normal">One possible approach is to keep those messages but disable the non-essential ones in the final build, such as informative messages, keeping the error-reporting function active. One way to do this is through compiler directives, such as the ones used in the following screenshot. Remember that this kind of <code class="inlineCode">if</code> statement is executed by the compiler and can exclude entire portions of code when compiling if its conditions are not met:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_30_PE.png" alt="A picture containing text, font, screenshot, line  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.30: Disabling code</p>
    <p class="normal">In the preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker1291"/> screenshot, you can see how we are asking whether this code is being compiled by the editor or for a development build, which is a special kind of build intended to be used for testing (more on that in the next chapter). You can also create your own kind of logging system with functions with the compiler directives, so you don’t need to use them in every log that you want to exclude.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we learned about the tasks a CPU faces when processing a video game, how to profile them to see which ones are not necessary, and how to reduce the impact of those processes. There are a few other script aspects that can affect performance not only on the processing side but also on the memory side, so let’s discuss them in the next section.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-258" class="heading-1">Optimizing memory</h1>
    <p class="normal">We discussed how to <a id="_idIndexMarker1292"/>profile and optimize two pieces of hardware—the CPU and GPU—but there is another piece of hardware that plays a key role in our game—RAM. This is the place where we put all of our game’s data. Games can be memory-intensive applications, and unlike several other applications, they are constantly executing code, so we need to be especially careful about that. The problem is that if we consume too much memory, we risk slowing down our game performance due to more costly memory accesses, or even making our game crash on non-PC platforms, like mobile or even consoles.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will examine the following memory optimization concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Memory allocation and the garbage collector</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Using the Memory Profiler</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start discussing how memory allocation works and what role garbage collection plays here.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-259" class="heading-2">Memory allocation and the garbage collector</h2>
    <p class="normal">Each time we instantiate<a id="_idIndexMarker1293"/> an object, we are allocating memory in RAM, and in a game, we will be allocating memory constantly. In other programming languages, aside from allocating the memory, you need to manually deallocate it, but C# has a garbage collector, which is a system that tracks unused memory and cleans it. This system works with a reference counter, which tracks how many references to an object exist, and when that counter reaches <code class="inlineCode">0</code>, it means all references have become null and the object can be deallocated. This deallocation process can be triggered in several situations, the most common situation being when we reach the maximum assigned memory and want to allocate a new object. In that scenario, we can release enough memory to allocate our object, and if that is not possible, the memory is expanded.</p>
    <p class="normal">In any game, you will probably be allocating and deallocating memory constantly, which can lead to memory fragmentation, meaning there are small spaces between alive object memory blocks that are mostly useless because they aren’t big enough to allocate an object, or maybe the sum of the spaces is big enough, but we need continuous memory space to allocate our objects. </p>
    <p class="normal">In the following diagram, you can see a classic example of trying to fit a big chunk of memory into the little gaps generated by fragmentation:</p>

    <p class="normal">Some types of <a id="_idIndexMarker1294"/>garbage collection systems, such as the one in regular C#, are generational, meaning memory is split into generation buckets according to the “age” of its memory. Newer memory will be placed in the first bucket, and this memory tends to be allocated and deallocated frequently. Because this bucket is small, working within it is fast. The second bucket has the memory that survived a previous deallocation sweep process in the first bucket. That memory is moved to the second bucket to prevent it from being checked constantly for whether it survived the process, and it is possible that that memory will last the length of our program’s lifetime. The third bucket is just another layer of bucket 2. The idea is that most of the time, the allocation and deallocation system will be working in bucket 1, and as it is small enough, it is quick to allocate, deallocate, and compact memory in a continuous fashion.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">For more detailed information about how Unity manages memory and what memory fragmentation<a id="_idIndexMarker1295"/> is, please refer to the following link: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/performance-managed-memory.html"><span class="url">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/performance-managed-memory.html</span></a></p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">The problem here is that <a id="_idIndexMarker1296"/>Unity uses its own version of the<a id="_idIndexMarker1297"/> garbage collection system, and that version is non-generational and non-compacting, meaning memory is not split into buckets and memory won’t be moved to fill the gaps. This suggests that allocating and deallocating memory in Unity will still result in the fragmentation problem, and if you don’t regulate your memory allocation, you might end up with an expensive garbage collection system being executed very often, producing hiccups in our game, which you can see in the <strong class="screenText">Profiler CPU Usage</strong> module as a pale-yellow color.</p>
    <p class="normal">One way to deal with this is by preventing memory allocation as much as you can, avoiding it when it is not necessary. There are a few tweaks here and there that you can make to prevent memory allocation, but before looking at those, again, it is important to first get data about the problem before you start fixing things that may not be an issue. This advice applies to any type of optimization process. Here, we can still use the <strong class="screenText">CPU Usage</strong> profiler to see how much memory is allocated to each function call that the CPU executes in each frame, and that is simply done by looking at the <strong class="screenText">GC Alloc</strong> column, which indicates the amount of memory that the function allocated:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_32_PE.png" alt="Table  Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.32: The memory allocation of the Update event function of Sight</p>
    <p class="normal">In the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker1298"/>screenshot, we can see how our function is allocating too much memory, which is produced because there are many enemies in the scene. But that’s no excuse; we are allocating that much RAM at every frame, so we need to improve this. There are several things that can contribute to our memory being claimed by allocations, so let’s discuss the basic ones, starting with array-returning functions.</p>
    <p class="normal">If we review the <code class="inlineCode">Sight</code> script code, we can see that the only moment where we are allocating memory is in the call to <code class="inlineCode">Physics.OverlapSphere</code>, and that is evident because it is an array-returning function, which is a function that returns a varying amount of data. To do this, it needs to allocate an array and return that array to us. This needs to be done on the side that created the function, Unity, but in this case, Unity gives us two versions of the function—the one that we are using and the <code class="inlineCode">NonAlloc</code> version. It is usually recommended to use the second version, but Unity uses the other one to make coding simpler for beginners.</p>
    <p class="normal">The <code class="inlineCode">NonAlloc</code> version looks as in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_33_PE.png" alt="A screen shot of a computer code  Description automatically generated with low confidence"/></figure>
    <figure class="mediaobject">Figure 18.33: Memory allocation of the Update event function of Sight</figure>
    <p class="normal">This version requires us to<a id="_idIndexMarker1299"/> allocate an array with enough space to save the largest amount of colliders our <code class="inlineCode">OverlapSphere</code> variable can find and pass it as the third parameter. This allows us to allocate the array just once and reuse it on every occasion that we need it. In the preceding screenshot, you can see how the array is static, which means it is shared between all the <code class="inlineCode">Sight</code> variables as they won’t execute in parallel (no <code class="inlineCode">Update</code> function will). This will work fine. Keep in mind that the function will return the number of objects that were detected, so we just iterate on that count. The array can have previous results stored within it.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, check your Profiler and notice how the amount of memory allocated has been reduced greatly. There might be some remaining memory allocation within our function, but sometimes there is no way to keep it at <code class="inlineCode">0</code>. However, you can try to look at the reasons for this using deep profiling or by commenting some code and seeing which comment removes the allocation. I challenge you to try this and observe which changes lead to reduced memory allocation values. Also, <code class="inlineCode">OverlapSphere</code> is not the only case where this could occur. You have others, such as the <code class="inlineCode">GetComponents</code> functions family, which, unlike <code class="inlineCode">GetComponent</code>, finds all the components of a given type, not just the first one, so pay attention to any array-returning function of Unity and try to replace it with a non-allocating version, if there is one.</p>
    <p class="normal">Another common source of <a id="_idIndexMarker1300"/>memory allocation is string concatenation. Remember that strings are immutable, meaning they cannot change if you concatenate two strings. A third one needs to be generated with enough space to hold the first ones. If you need to concatenate a large number of times, consider using <code class="inlineCode">string.Format</code> if you are just replacing placeholders in a template string, such as putting the name of the player and the score they got in a message or using <code class="inlineCode">StringBuilder</code>, a class that just holds all the strings to be concatenated in a list and, when necessary, concatenates them together, instead of concatenating them one by one as the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> operator does. Also, consider using the new string interpolation functionality of C#. You can see some examples in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_34_PE.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer code  Description automatically generated with low confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.34: String management in C#</p>
    <p class="normal">Finally, a classic technique to consider is <a id="_idIndexMarker1301"/>object pooling, which is suitable in cases where you need to instantiate and destroy objects constantly, such as with bullets or effects. In that scenario, the use of regular <code class="inlineCode">Instantiate</code> and <code class="inlineCode">Destroy</code> functions will lead to memory fragmentation, but object pooling fixes that by allocating the maximum amount of required objects possible. It replaces <code class="inlineCode">Instantiate</code> by taking one of the preallocated functions and it replaces <code class="inlineCode">Destroy</code> by returning the object to the pool.</p>
    <p class="normal">A simple pool can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_18_35_PE.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer program  Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.35: A simple object pool</p>
    <p class="normal">There are several ways to improve<a id="_idIndexMarker1302"/> this pool, but it is fine as it is for now. Note that objects need to be reinitialized when they are taken out of the pool, and you can do that with the <code class="inlineCode">OnEnable</code> event function or by creating a custom function to inform the object to do so.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">Please note that Unity has recently added an Object Pool class that you can investigate at the following link: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Pool.ObjectPool_1.html"><span class="url">https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Pool.ObjectPool_1.html</span></a>, but I still recommend making your own first to grasp the idea of pools.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have explored some basic memory allocation reduction techniques, let’s look at the new <strong class="screenText">Memory Profiler</strong> tool, introduced in the previous version of Unity but now finally not a preview package anymore but available as a 1.0.0 version, to explore memory in greater detail.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-260" class="heading-2">Using the Memory Profiler</h2>
    <p class="normal">With this Profiler, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1303"/>can detect memory allocated on a frame-per-frame basis, but it won’t show the total memory allocated so far, which would be useful to study how we are using our memory. This is where the <strong class="screenText">Memory Profiler</strong> can help us. This relatively new Unity package allows us to take memory snapshots of every single object allocated both on the native and managed side—<em class="italic">native</em> meaning the internal C++ Unity code and <em class="italic">managed</em> meaning anything that belongs to the C# side (that is, both our code and Unity’s C# engine code). We can explore snapshots with a visual tool and rapidly see which type of object is consuming the most RAM and how they are referenced by other objects.</p>
    <p class="normal">To start using the <strong class="screenText">Memory Profiler</strong>, do the following:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the <strong class="screenText">Package Manager</strong> (<strong class="screenText">Window | Package Manager</strong>) and look for the Memory Profiler package.

      <li class="numberedList" value="5">In our case, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1306"/> can see that we are consuming 2.76 GB of memory, split between <strong class="screenText">Managed </strong>(C# code variables), <strong class="screenText">Executables &amp; Mapped </strong>(built code of the application)<strong class="screenText">, Native</strong> (Unity’s C++ memory), <strong class="screenText">Graphics </strong>(Graphics Driver and GPU memory usage to render our scene)<strong class="screenText">, Profiler </strong>(because we are profiling our session), <strong class="screenText">Audio</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Unknown</strong> (memory that can’t be categorized, like allocations made by third-party native plugins). There are different things that are accounted for in these categories, but for now, we are good. Open the package documentation in the <strong class="screenText">Package Manager</strong> to get more info about them.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click the <strong class="screenText">Unity Objects</strong> tab at the top part of the middle section of the <strong class="screenText">Memory Profiler</strong> window.

Then, we can reduce its size using the <strong class="screenText">Max Size of the Texture</strong> import settings.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">You can also use the two checkboxes at the bottom of the <strong class="screenText">Unity Objects View</strong> to flatten all the objects appearing in the Hierarchy without any group or category and find any possible duplicate object (i.e., by mistakenly duplicating the same asset in the project).</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.41: Filter the Unity Object groups’ appearances</p>
    <p class="normal">As with any profiler, it <a id="_idIndexMarker1309"/>is always useful to carry out the profiling directly in the build (more on that in the next chapter) because taking snapshots in the editor will capture lots of memory that is used by the editor and will not be used in the build. An example of this is the loading of unnecessary textures because the editor probably loaded them when you clicked them to see their previews in the <strong class="screenText">Inspector</strong> window.</p>
    <p class="normal">Consider that due to the <strong class="screenText">Memory Profiler</strong> being a package, its UI can change often, but its basic idea will remain. You can use this tool to detect whether you are using the memory in unexpected ways. Something useful to consider here is how Unity loads assets when loading a scene, which consists of loading all assets referenced in the scene at load time. This means that you can have, as an example, an array of prefabs that have references to materials that have references to textures, and even if you don’t instantiate a single instance of them, the prefabs must be loaded in memory, causing them to occupy space. In this scenario, I recommend that you explore the use of <code class="inlineCode">Addressables</code>, which provide a way to load assets dynamically. But let’s keep things simple for now.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">The Memory Profiler also has a feature to compare two snapshots. This is useful for detecting memory leaks (which, in C#, can be caused by non-nullified references) and unreleased assets between two specific moments in the game (such as before starting a level and after starting the next one).

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-261" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">Optimizing a game is not an easy task, especially if you are not familiar with the internals of how each Unity system works. Sadly, this is a titanic task, and no one knows every single system down to its finest details, but with the tools learned about in this chapter, we have a way to explore how changes affect systems through exploration. We learned how to profile the CPU, GPU, and RAM and what the key hardware in any game is. We also covered some common good practices to avoid abusing them.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, you can diagnose performance issues in your game, gathering data about the performance of the three main pieces of hardware—the CPU, GPU, and RAM—and then using that data to focus your optimization efforts on applying the correct optimization technique. Performance is important as your game needs to run smoothly to give your users a pleasant experience.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we are going to see how to create a build of our game to share with other people, without needing to install Unity. This is also very useful for profiling, given that profiling builds are going to give us more accurate data than profiling in the editor.</p>
