- en: So, what exactly do UI and GUI stand for, and what’s the difference? **UI**
    stands for **user interface** and **GUI** (pronounced “gooey”) stands for **graphical
    user interface**. To *interface* means to *interact with*, so the UI is the set
    of devices that let a player interact with a game. The mouse, keyboard, game controller,
    touch screen, and so on are all part of the UI. The GUI is the subset of the UI
    represented by graphics. So, onscreen buttons, dropdown menus, and icons are all
    part of a game’s GUI. As the GUI is a subset of the UI, many people (myself included)
    tend to just refer to the GUI as the UI. Unity also refers to all the GUI items
    they provide templates for as the UI.

- en: A game’s HUD falls into the **non-diegetic** category. This information exists
    purely for the player to view and the characters within the game are not aware
    of its presence. It exists on the *fourth* wall of the game view and appears to
    be on the screen in front of everything. The examples of this type of UI are endless,
    as nearly every game has some non-diegetic UI elements.
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, a **diegetic** interface is one that exists within the game world
    and the characters within the game are aware of its presence. Common examples
    of this include characters looking at inventory or maps. The most widely referred-to
    example of diegetic UI is the inventory and health display within *Deadspace*.
    The inventory displays on a holographic display window that pops up in front of
    the playable character, and he interacts with it as you select his weaponry. His
    health is also indicated by a meter on his back. The inventory of *Alone in the
    Dark* (2008) is displayed in a diegetic way as well. While there are some UI elements
    that only the player can see, the main character views inventory within their
    jacket pockets and interacts with the items. *Uncharted Lost Legacy* and *Far
    Cry 2* both use maps that the characters physically hold in the scene and interact
    with. *Fallout 3* and *Fallout 4* use a diegetic interface to display the inventory
    and map on the character’s Pip-Boy, which is permanently attached to their arm.
    Games also use this type of display when characters are in a vehicle or suit,
    where various displays appear on the shield, window, or cockpit.
  id: totrans-25

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Meta** interfaces are interfaces that the characters in the game are aware
    of, but they are not physically displayed within the scene. Common examples of
    this are speed displays for racing games. *Forza 7* actually uses a combination
    of meta and diegetic displays for the speedometer. A meta speed indicator is persistently
    on the lower-right corner of the screen for the player to see. Since the character
    is constantly aware of how fast they are driving, they would be aware of this
    speed indicator, therefore making it a meta interface. There is also a diegetic
    speedometer in the car’s dash that is displayed when playing in first-person view.
    Another common usage of this type of display is a cell phone that appears on the
    screen but is implied the playable character is interacting with. *Persona 5*,
    *Catherine*, and *Grand Theft Auto 5* all use this interface type for cell phone
    interactions.'

    within the game are not aware of it. Interfaces that exist in the scene but that
    the characters are not aware of are incredibly common. This is commonly used to
    let the player know where in the scene interactable items are, what the in-game
    character is doing, or information about characters and items in the scene. For
    example, in *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, arrows appear over the heads
    of enemies, indicating who Link will attack. Link is not actually aware of these
    arrow icons; they are there for the player to know who he is focusing on. *Xenoblade
    Chronicles 2* uses a spatial interface to indicate where the player can dig by
    displaying a shovel icon over the diggable areas.'

    If your game is designed for a mobile device and has a lot of buttons the player
    will interact with, the buttons are generally best suited for the bottom or side
    portions of the screen. This is due to the way players hold their phones and the
    top-center part of the screen is the most difficult area to reach with their thumb.
    Additionally, reaching for this area will cause them to block the majority of
    the game view with their hand. We will discuss designing UI for mobile more thoroughly

    the width and height (expressed as width:height). This aspect ratio is determined

    at multiple resolutions/aspect ratios (for example, a mobile project or a web
    game that scales within a window), you want your UI to scale and move appropriately.
