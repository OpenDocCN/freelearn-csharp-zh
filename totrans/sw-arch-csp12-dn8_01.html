<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">The main point about designing great solutions is foundational to the purpose of this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">You must understand that great real-world solutions bring with them a few fundamental constraints:</span></p>

<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">The solution needs to be delivered on time.</span></li>

<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">Eliminate waste</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">: You may consider waste to be anything that will interfere with the delivery of the real need of the customer.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">Build quality in</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">: An organization that wants to guarantee quality needs to promote it in processes from the very beginning, instead of only considering it when code is being tested.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">Create knowledge</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">: All companies that have achieved excellence have a common pattern of generating new knowledge by disciplined experimentation, documenting that knowledge, and guaranteeing that it is spread all over the organization.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">Defer commitment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">: Plan decisions at the latest possible moment without causing damage to the project.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">Deliver fast</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">: The faster you deliver software, the more elimination of waste you have. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">Companies that compete using time frequency have significant advantages over their competitors.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">Respect people</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">: Giving reasonable objectives to the team, together with plans that will guide them to self-organize their routine, is a matter of respecting the people that you work with.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">Optimize the whole</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">: A lean company improves the cycle of value; from the moment it receives a new requirement to the point at which it delivers the software.</span></li>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">Following the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker030"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1"> lean principles helps a team or company to improve the quality of the features that are delivered to the customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.2">It also creates a reduction in time spent on features that will not be used by the customer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.3">In lean, deciding the features that are important to the customer guides the team in delivering software that matters, and this is exactly what the Agile Manifesto intends to promote in software teams.</span></p>

<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">Writing software requirements using user stories</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">: User stories are considered an agile approach to describing user needs, together with acceptance tests, which are used to guarantee the correct implementation.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">Divide software into iterations and deliver small releases</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">: The practice of iterating in software development is implemented by all methodologies aside from waterfall. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">The fact of delivering faster versions decreases the risk of not meeting the customer’s expectations.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">Avoid working overtime and guarantee a sustainable velocity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">: Although this must be one of the hardest tasks a software architect may deal with, overtime indicates that something is not working properly in the process.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">Keep things simple</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">: While developing solutions, it is quite common to try to anticipate features that the customer would like to have. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">This approach increases the complexity of the development and the time to market the solution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.3">A different approach will cause high costs, and probably a low level of features that are used in the system you are developing.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">Refactoring</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">: The approach of refactoring the code continuously is good because it enables the evolution of your software and guarantees the design improvement that will truly be necessary due to the normal technical changes of the platforms you use to develop.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">Keep the customer always available</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">: If you follow XP, you should have an expert customer inside your team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.2">This is certainly something that is hard to do, but the main idea of this approach is to guarantee that the customer is involved in all parts of development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.3">As another bonus, having the customer close to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker037"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1"> your team means they understand the difficulties and expertise the team has, enabling an increase in trust between the parties.</span></li>

<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">Code the unit test first</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">: A unit test is an approach where you program specific code for testing a single unit (class/method) of your project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.2">This is discussed in a current development methodology called </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">Test-Driven Development</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1"> (</span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">TDD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.2">The</span><a id="_idIndexMarker038"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1"> main goal here is to guarantee that every business rule has its own unit test case.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">Code must be written to agreed standards</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">: The need to determine standards for coding is connected to the idea that no matter which developer you have working on a specific part of the project, the code must be written so that any of them will understand it.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">Pair programming</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">: Pair programming is another difficult approach to achieve in every single minute of a software project, but the technique itself – one programmer coding and the other actively observing and offering comments, criticism, and advice – is useful in critical scenarios.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">Acceptance tests</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">: The adoption of acceptance tests to meet user stories is a good way to guarantee that newly released versions of the software do not cause damage to its current needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.2">An even better option is to have these acceptance tests automated.</span></li>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.1">One of the most common performance Achilles’ heels is database access. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.2">The reason why this is still a big problem is a lack of attention paid while writing queries or lambda expressions to get information from a database. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.3">This book will cover Entity Framework Core in </span><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.1">Chapter 13</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1">Interacting with Data in C# – Entity Framework Core</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1">, but it is important to know what to choose and the correct data information to read from a database. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.2">Filtering columns and rows is imperative for an application that wants to deliver on performance.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">The good </span><a id="_idIndexMarker085"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.1">thing is that best practices related to caching, asynchronous programming, and object allocation fit completely into the environment of databases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.2">It is only a matter of choosing the correct pattern to get better-performing software.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-39"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">Case 2 – the user’s needs are not properly implemented</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1">The more</span><a id="_idIndexMarker086"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.1"> technology is used in a wide variety of areas, the more difficult it is to deliver exactly what the user needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.2">Maybe this sentence sounds weird to you, but you must understand that developers, in general, study how to develop software, but they rarely study delivering the needs of a specific area. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.3">Of course, it is not easy to learn how to develop software, but it is even more difficult to understand a specific need in a specific area. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.4">Software development nowadays delivers software to all types of industries. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.5">The question here is </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.1">how can a developer, whether a software architect or not, evolve enough to deliver software in the area they are responsible for?</span></em></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.1">Gathering software requirements will help you in this tough task; writing them will make you understand and organize the architecture of the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.2">There are several ways to minimize the risks of implementing something different from what the user really needs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.1">Prototyping the interface to achieve an understanding of the user interface faster</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.1">Designing the data flow to detect gaps between the system and the user operations</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.1">Frequent meetings to stay up to date on the user’s current needs and be aligned with incremental deliveries</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.1">Again, as a software architect, you will have to define how the software will be implemented. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.2">Most of the time, you are not going to be the one who programs it, but you will always be the one responsible for this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.3">For this reason, some techniques can be useful to avoid the wrong implementation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.1">Requirements are reviewed by the developers to guarantee that they understand what they need to develop.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.1">Code inspection to validate a predefined code standard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.2">We will cover this in </span><em class="chapterRef"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.1">Chapter 4</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.1">Best Practices in Coding C# 12</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.1">.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.610.1">Meetings to eliminate impediments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.1">Remember, making sure the implementation matches the user’s needs is your responsibility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.2">Use every tool you can to do so.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-40"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.612.1">Case 3 – the usability of the system does not meet the user’s needs</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.1">Usability is a key </span><a id="_idIndexMarker087"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.1">point for the success of a software project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.2">The way the software is presented and how it solves a problem will determine whether the user wants to use it or not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.3">As a software architect, you must keep in mind that delivering software with good usability is mandatory nowadays.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.1">There are basic concepts of usability that this book does not intend to cover, but a good way to meet the user’s needs when it comes to usability is by understanding who is going to use the software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.2">Design Thinking can help you a lot with that, as was discussed earlier in this chapter.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.1">Understanding the user will help you to decide whether the software is going to run on a web page, a cell phone, or even in the background. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.2">This understanding is very important to a software architect because the elements of a system will be better presented if you correctly map who will use them.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.617.1">On the other hand, if you do not care about that, you will just deliver software that works. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.617.2">This can be good for a short time, but it will not exactly meet the real needs that made a person ask you to architect the software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.617.3">You must keep in mind the options and understand that good software is software designed to run on many platforms and devices.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.1">You will be happy to know that .NET 8 is an incredible cross-platform option for that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.2">So, you can develop solutions to run your apps in Linux, Windows, Android, and iOS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.3">You can run your applications on big screens, tablets, cell phones, and even drones! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.4">You can embed apps on boards for automation or in HoloLens for mixed reality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.5">Software architects must be open-minded to design exactly what their users need.</span></p>
