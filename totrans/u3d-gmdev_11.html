<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-255">Build and Test</h1>
<p class="normal">At this point in the development journey, we’ve gone through a great amount of work together. We should now have a vertical slice of a game that, so far, we’ve been able to play in the Unity Editor and it’s working. This is wonderful, but are you going to expect your players to download Unity and open the package up, then play it in the editor? I think not! This is where we want to build the game project out into an executable. In this chapter, we will go over how to build your game out so it can be published and tested and ultimately get into the hands of players.</p>
<p class="normal">You will learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Building from Unity</li>
<li class="bulletList">Testing—functional, performance, playtesting, soak, and localization testing</li>
<li class="bulletList">User Experience (UX)</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-256">Building with Unity</h1>
<p class="normal">We’ve worked<a id="_idIndexMarker736"/> very hard to put together an experience. We now need to be able to get it out to people. To do this, we need to tell Unity a couple of things. It needs to know what you are building for, such as which scenes should be built within the application, which platform, and additional options that affect the build output executable.</p>
<p class="normal">Where we are now in the vertical slice is a good place to build at. This may not always be the case in every project. In most cases, the best way to work with the build is this: build early, build often. In our case, we needed to wait until we had some mechanics and a standard playthrough from our two major puzzles before we decided to build. </p>
<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Figure 11.1 </em>you can see the <strong class="screenText">Build Settings</strong> menu, which is found under <strong class="screenText">File</strong> &gt; <strong class="screenText">Build Settings</strong>. Below the<a id="_idIndexMarker737"/> image, we will break down each of these settings.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface  Description automatically generated" height="388" src="../Images/B17304_11_01.png" width="783"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.1: Build settings</p>
<p class="normal">The first block we see is <strong class="screenText">Scenes In Build</strong>. As it is at the top, we should have a feeling that it’s important. This automatically places the default scene into the box, but there may be other scenes that you want. You may have another scene for menu systems or another map that might be a tutorial level. The key factor here is to have the scenes that you want in the <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>game in this box; you can just drag the scenes from the project window into the <strong class="screenText">Scenes In Build</strong> box.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="normal">The top scene in this list will always be the first scene that is loaded.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Below the <strong class="screenText">Scenes In Build</strong> block, the GUI is split into two sections, <strong class="screenText">Platform</strong> and then settings for that platform. On the left, we choose which platform we want to build for. After that, the settings for that platform will be on the right side. We will go over just the <strong class="screenText">PC, Mac &amp; Linux Standalone</strong> options.</p>
<p class="normal">If you are <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>building for any other platform, the Unity documentation will help guide you through the building process. We will be describing most of the parameters that are available below. Console and mobile choices will have a few different available parameters specific to their target platform’s needs. </p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-257">Target platform</h2>
<p class="normal">This option is <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>simple enough: which platform would you like to target with this build? The choices here are Windows, macOS, and Linux. We are building for Windows with this vertical slice.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-258">Architecture</h2>
<p class="normal">We need to know<a id="_idIndexMarker741"/> what CPU architecture we should be planning on. A 32-bit OS will require your game to use less than 4 GB of RAM. You can do this, but you can use 64-bit for smaller games as well; it will not hurt your game. In general, 64-bit should be the way to go.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-259">Server Build</h2>
<p class="normal">Unity can create<a id="_idIndexMarker742"/> a server for your game if you are working on a multiplayer game. This will build the player settings with no visual elements. It will also build managed scripts that are defined for multiplayer. We will not be working with this, but know the option is there. We also will not be going over multiplayer development with Unity as that would be a much different project from the beginning. </p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-260">Copy PDB files</h2>
<p class="normal">This is a Windows-platform-only setting. It will allow you to build in the Microsoft program database for debugging. We will not be using this either in our build. </p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-261">Create Visual Studio Solution</h2>
<p class="normal">This <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>is also a Windows-platform-only setting. Enabling this will allow you to build from Visual Studio instead of only from <strong class="screenText">Build Settings</strong> menu. If you are targeting macOS, there would instead be a <strong class="screenText">Create Xcode Project</strong> checkbox.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-262">Development Build</h2>
<p class="normal">Enabling <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>this will allow debugging, including the Profiler. The Profiler is an analyzer to know what is being performed during runtime. </p>
<p class="normal">We will be going over this thoroughly in the <em class="italic">Testing</em> section of this chapter. There are also defined settings that will be included. This is very good for when you need to test your application and are worried about performance. You especially need to keep it in mind if you have a tight visual budget. There is a term that is used called “benchmarking.” This term refers to testing your build on a target machine. If you choose a lower-end computer to test on, note its specs and build the game in development mode so that you can run the Profiler while it’s running. Once you have the benchmark, you can make some educated guesses on how it will run on higher-end and lower-end machines.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-263">Autoconnect Profiler</h2>
<p class="normal">If you<a id="_idIndexMarker745"/> have <strong class="screenText">Development Build</strong> turned on, then you can enable this setting. It will automatically connect the Profiler that we talked about above in the <em class="italic">Development Build</em> section.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-264">Deep Profiling Support</h2>
<p class="normal">This also<a id="_idIndexMarker746"/> requires the development build to be enabled. This enables the Unity Profiler to record more detailed data. This will not be the best option for checking performance as there could be some slowing down of executing scripts. The primary purpose of a deep profiling build is to get a specific cause of managed applications by recording all function calls. </p>
<p class="normal">Since every method will be recorded individually, deep profiling provides a very clear view of what is being called and when. Some bugs during gameplay can be lured out and caught more easily with a deep profile. </p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-265">Script Debugging</h2>
<p class="normal">Enabling<a id="_idIndexMarker747"/> this also needs <strong class="screenText">Development Build</strong> enabled and it adds debugging symbols to the script code. This will allow the <strong class="keyWord">IDE</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">Integrated Development Editor</strong>, such as Visual Studio) to be attached to the game when it runs to debug it through your breakpoints and debugging systems. When you select this, another option will pop up as shown below in <em class="italic">Figure 11.2</em>:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" height="71" src="../Images/B17304_11_02.png" width="311"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.2: Wait For Managed Debugger build setting option</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Wait For Managed Debugger</strong> option, if enabled, will wait until the IDE is looking for the build to ask for the connection. No scripts will be executed until there is a connection with the debugger.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-266">Scripts Only Build</h2>
<p class="normal">There may <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>come a time when you find some bugs and need to be able to make some changes, but you don’t want to build everything. Data files can get to be very large. We have talked previously in this book about how iteration matters more than almost anything. This can significantly reduce the time between iterations of debugging. </p>
<p class="normal">This option will only build the scripts and keep all the data files intact. </p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-267">Compression Method</h2>
<p class="normal">There are<a id="_idIndexMarker749"/> three options here: <strong class="screenText">Default</strong>, <strong class="screenText">LZ4</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">LZ4HC</strong>. <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> means <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>no compression. No compression will have a runnable file on Windows, Mac, and Linux right away. On Android builds, it will build as a ZIP file.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">LZ4</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>useful for development builds as the data stored will be compressed and unpacked or decompressed during runtime. Scene and asset loading depend on disk read speeds. This is another option that can be used to help iteration speeds as the build time is faster than the default. An interesting note is that LZ4 decompression on Android is faster than the default ZIP.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">LZ4HC</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker752"/> high-compression version of LZ4, which will take longer to build as it compresses the build further. This is a great option for release builds after spending time debugging.</p>
<p class="normal">Starting with <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> for quick tests in gameplay testing is a good idea. After you get to the point where you need to development build and debug, use LZ4. Then after you’re ready to make releases, build on LZ4HC.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-268">Testing</h1>
<p class="normal">Testing a<a id="_idIndexMarker753"/> game is a broad concept. There are large testing portions that are more common and some smaller, more specific ones. The more common testing patterns we see are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Functional</li>
<li class="bulletList">Performance</li>
<li class="bulletList">Playtesting</li>
<li class="bulletList">Soak</li>
<li class="bulletList">Localization</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">If you research game QA or game testing, you will find several other names for testing, and a studio may have their own specific testing that is their form of best practice. </p>
<p class="normal">None of this is wrong. The testing we will explain from the list above is seen in almost every studio. Let’s break down the first in the list, functional testing.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-269">Functional testing</h2>
<p class="normal">Your testing<a id="_idIndexMarker754"/> started well before you got to this chapter. Every time<a id="_idIndexMarker755"/> you pressed play to check if a script did what it was supposed to do, you tested that script alongside the rest of the game. This is part of the iterative nature of game development and is also called functional testing.</p>
<p class="normal">Functional testing <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>has a very direct name! It’s testing for the game’s functions. A few examples of the scope of the functions being tested are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Animation – Looking for animations that don’t work together or character rigs that are broken. This is carried out by testing mechanics and movements where the character animation is being transitioned to other animations.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Audio elements and quality – Listening intently for the purpose of hearing imperfections at specific times. Examples of this might be listening for footstep sounds that sound wrong, ambient noises for objects that aren’t there, and anywhere sound is incorrectly placed.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Cinematics – Playing through the cinematics to find any out-of-place sounds, visuals, animations, or timing of the entire cinematic.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Instructions or tutorials – There could be instructions on how to play the game. These instructions should be written properly and make sense to the controller scheme the player is using.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Mechanics interaction – Playing through all the mechanics to feel them out, checking to see if they are working as intended and can be completed if there is completion.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Sorting – This is a visual check dealing with transparency issues. Layers on the screen need to know their layer on the screen. Some effects and UI will have a hard time knowing what is on top to be sorted properly. This takes testing with multiple scenarios to ensure that the GameObjects with transparency are sorting properly.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Usability – Usability has its own thread of work that can be tested, but in this case, we are looking for controller schemes that make sense and work. An example is the <strong class="screenText">A</strong> button being used for a jump; this is so common that if something else is used, it would need to be explained thoroughly as to why.</li>
<li class="bulletList">UI (menu structure, resolution, aspect ratio, font sizing) – The user interface needs to be checked thoroughly for many parts. How does it look when it’s scaled? Do the colors look correct? Can you understand how the menu flows? Every small problem that pops up will be seen by the majority of users. They need to be documented to be fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">As<a id="_idIndexMarker757"/> you<a id="_idIndexMarker758"/> can see, functional testing is thorough and needs to be iterated on to make sure that the game’s functions all make sense to the player and work properly. When you’re playing the game to test a single mechanic, this is a great practice, but it is only checking out that mechanic in a bubble. The rest of the game could potentially be affected by the changes you are making. Strong functional testing done early and often will make your project that much cleaner and more positive in the end.</p>
<p class="normal">While working through functional testing, you may encounter hitches in rendering, making the framerate low. If this happens, take note and add it to the list of performance testing that will be done as well. Since we’re on the topic, let’s go into how to performance test in Unity.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-270">Performance testing</h2>
<p class="normal">Inside Unity, we<a id="_idIndexMarker759"/> have four sources of analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Unity Profiler</li>
<li class="bulletList">Memory Profiler</li>
<li class="bulletList">Frame debugger</li>
<li class="bulletList">Physics debugger and Profiler</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">All four of<a id="_idIndexMarker760"/> these analysis tools have their own specific uses to help define what might be causing an issue. We will go through them to a basic degree to get familiar with each one. Starting off, we need to go over the most commonly used one, Unity Profiler.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-271">Unity profiler</h3>
<p class="normal">To <a id="_idIndexMarker761"/>perform profiling, you will need to use Unity’s analyzing tool, the<a id="_idIndexMarker762"/> Profiler, which looks as in <em class="italic">Figure 11.3</em> below:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated" height="249" src="../Images/B17304_11_03.png" width="824"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.3: Unity’s Profiler window example</p>
<p class="normal">The profiling tool helps with identifying CPU use, memory usage, and rendering time. When <a id="_idIndexMarker763"/>you open the Profiler by going to <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> &gt; <strong class="screenText">Analysis</strong> &gt; <strong class="screenText">Profiler,</strong> you <a id="_idIndexMarker764"/>will see four sections, as displayed in <em class="italic">Figure 11.3</em> above. The four sections are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">(Red) Profiler modules – This section contains what profile modules are in use and has colors to show what is taking place when the recording of the Profiler starts.</li>
<li class="bulletList">(Orange) Profiler controls – These controls are for setting up what the Profiler is doing. Here you can start recording and change modes or the Profiler tool.</li>
<li class="bulletList">(Yellow) Frame charts – This shows the individual frames as a stacked chart over time and curves for rendering passes.</li>
<li class="bulletList">(Green) Module details panels – The module details panels explain every section of the selected frame broken down over a percentage of use on the thread requested. <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> is the main thread.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">As an example, in the profile below in <em class="italic">Figure 11.4</em>, we have a frame selected while playing our game; I recorded 7800 frames while moving Myvari around. You can see that we’re currently running close to 60 frames per second. I wanted to know what was taking the most CPU time from the <strong class="screenText">PlayerLoop</strong> — in this case, it was the game being played in the editor at ~80%. Scrolling down the <strong class="screenText">PlayerLoop,</strong> we see that the forward renderer is the heaviest task on the main thread. There is not a lot going on currently in the scene, which is why we’re running an average of 60 FPS. </p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface  Description automatically generated" height="333" src="../Images/B17304_11_04.png" width="825"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.4: Profiler with frame selected</p>
<p class="normal">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>see how much information comes along with the Profiler. This<a id="_idIndexMarker766"/> is fantastic information when you want to see what might be causing your game to have a lower framerate. </p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-272">Memory Profiler</h3>
<p class="normal">This <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>tool, as expected, profiles the memory of the editor. You can also <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>run the memory profiler on a standalone build if <strong class="screenText">Development Build</strong> is selected in the <strong class="screenText">Build Settings</strong> menu. The limitation here is that you cannot run the memory Profiler on a release build, just as with the Unity Profiler we saw previously. The Memory Profiler also isn’t automatically added to the Unity project. It is a package that can be added. To add it, follow along below.</p>
<p class="normal">To add the Memory Profiler, go to your <strong class="screenText">Package Manager</strong> and add a package by name. This can be done by selecting the options as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.5</em> and then adding <code class="inlineCode">com.unity.memoryProfiler</code> to the <strong class="screenText">Add package by name</strong> field:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message  Description automatically generated" height="206" src="../Images/B17304_11_05.png" width="725"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.5: (Left) Add package by name, (right) Adding the Memory Profiler</p>
<p class="normal">When<a id="_idIndexMarker769"/> it’s installed, you can access the Memory Profiler by going to <strong class="screenText">Windows</strong> &gt; <strong class="screenText">Analysis</strong> &gt; <strong class="screenText">Memory Profiler</strong>. When it first loads, you will see a blank<a id="_idIndexMarker770"/> middle section with an option to create a snapshot. If you press play and then take a snapshot, you will get a similar screen to what we have here. There is a large amount of info to go over within this Profiler. The primary use of this is if you have a low framerate and you want to check memory usage or if during a soak test you are seeing crashes. You can see, through multiple snapshots in time, what memory is being used.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface  Description automatically generated with low confidence" height="440" src="../Images/B17304_11_06.png" width="603"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.6: Memory Profiler</p>
<p class="normal">While looking at a snapshot, the center area breaks down all the memory in that snapshot. In the bottom area, there are blocks of everything used in groups. You can select the <a id="_idIndexMarker771"/>groups to break them down even further. We <a id="_idIndexMarker772"/>did this to the bottom mauve-colored block, which is used to display <code class="inlineCode">Texture2D</code>. We already knew that this would have? a large memory footprint as it’s the texturing for all the architecture. It needed to be fairly large. </p>
<p class="normal">If the memory looks as you expected, then it may be a good idea to look at the frame debugger to check what could be loading in specific frames that could cause issues. Let’s look into that tool next.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-273">Frame debugger</h3>
<p class="normal">Being<a id="_idIndexMarker773"/> able to see an individual frame and how the draw calls were<a id="_idIndexMarker774"/> constructed to give you the rendering of that frame can be very helpful for debugging visual artifacts. You may have used this when you were doing functional testing and found sorting issues. You can now load the frame debugger up and see when each item was rendered. From this point, you will have the knowledge to be<a id="_idIndexMarker775"/> able to work through why it was rendered in the wrong order. </p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Text  Description automatically generated" height="209" src="../Images/B17304_11_07.png" width="824"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.7: Frame debugger</p>
<p class="normal">Another <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>strong feature of the frame debugger is that you are able to see what Shader properties were set on the item that was being rendered, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.7</em> above. This is useful as when you are setting Shader properties procedurally, you may have an expectation of the Shader properties using certain textures of variables. If they aren’t as expected, then it would be a great idea to check out the frame and see what it is set to. This could lead to finding out that for one frame it was set<a id="_idIndexMarker777"/> to what you expected but then overridden. This could help lead you to the right script that is changing your Shader properties a frame or two after your expected values are being set.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-274">Physics debugger and Profiler module</h3>
<p class="normal">For <a id="_idIndexMarker778"/>physics, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker779"/>both a debugger and a Profiler module. The physics debugger is a visualization tool to know what physics collisions <a id="_idIndexMarker780"/>are in the<a id="_idIndexMarker781"/> scene and what they should or should not be able to collide with. As you saw in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Rigid Bodies and Physics Interaction</em>, the Rigidbody is complicated in its optimization settings for physics properties. Being able to visualize what type of collider is on what and where is a great help to knowing what objects are doing when and why. In <em class="italic">Figure 11.8</em> below, you can see in the scene which objects are physics objects. </p>
<p class="normal">Opening the <strong class="screenText">Colors</strong> section of the physics debugger will allow you to colorize them according to what you might need to debug:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface  Description automatically generated" height="412" src="../Images/B17304_11_08.png" width="666"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.8: Physics Debugger</p>
<p class="normal">After you have identified any physics issues from the GameObjects visualized by the physics debugger we have another tool to gather more information. Fortunately for us, we also have the physics Profiler module to be able to help us with any physics issues that are being visualized so we can look up the issue. The physics Profiler module is in the Unity Profiler and will help find answers to the physics discrepancies you may see when the debugger is on. </p>
<p class="normal">To see what the physics Profiler module looks like, see <em class="italic">Figure 11.9</em> below:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface, chart  Description automatically generated" height="318" src="../Images/B17304_11_09.png" width="791"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.9: Physics Profiler module</p>
<p class="normal">The use of this <a id="_idIndexMarker782"/>may not be understood at this point as we don’t have a case with our physics mechanics to show a direct problem. We don’t have fast-moving items that can cause a lot of physics issues. If your game does have fast-moving objects, when you are recording your Profiler and noticing GameObjects clipping through other GameObjects when they shouldn’t, this module would be good to see the total memory used. It’s possible that the memory being used is not allowing for the physics to update fast enough to get the active body information.</p>
<p class="normal">Physics debugging <a id="_idIndexMarker783"/>can take time to get to an answer as this needs to happen while the physics work is taking place. Be patient with this debugging and use as many tools as possible to get the answer you need. </p>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve gone over all of the debugging tools, we need to test the game with others outside of our team. This is called playtesting. Let’s get the game into others’ hands.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-275">Playtesting</h2>
<p class="normal">This is <a id="_idIndexMarker784"/>a difficult problem to assess. At first, it may be a good idea to test internally with you and your team, friends, and allies. You ask them to play the <a id="_idIndexMarker785"/>game and see how they feel about it. This is not meant to build your ego. You need to be there when they are playing and ask them to speak out loud about how they feel about the experience. Do not prompt them on anything. You want them to give you genuine feelings and if they speak to the intended experience, you’re on the right track. </p>
<p class="normal">Even if the game’s art isn’t in place and the menu systems are blocky objects with Arial font placeholding for later, none of that detracts from the core game experience. One example is the visceral response when someone enters the first emotional touchpoint you want to evoke. For our project, we want to give a sense of wonder. This is close to confusion, so we need to be deliberate in placement and light usage to encourage adventuring on the player’s terms. If they say things such as, “I wonder what’s over there,” we are leaning into that sense of wonder. </p>
<p class="normal">At the same time, they may say that same sentence, but you didn’t have anything planned. Let them explore wherever they thought there might be something and take note. It would be a good idea to put something there. Allow that inherent wonderment to take your design further than you have already gone. It almost doesn’t matter what would be there if there is a kind of interaction. An example of this is an area that has nothing to do with the narrative that’s off to the side just slightly, being available to move into. When testers move into spots on the map that you don’t expect them to, take that as an opportunity for engagement. You could build it up as a scenic view. When you walk over there, the camera pans out a bit to take in the view. This isn’t an addition to the story, but the sense of wonder was fulfilled. Something happened when you explored.</p>
<p class="normal">Exploration may not be a large portion of your game; maybe your title is a socially focused experience. The need for interaction is high for any player that is inside a multiplayer game. In what ways can you interact with your friends when playing together? An extremely good example of this is FromSoftware’s multiplayer interaction system. The social interaction in FromSoftware’s game — for example <em class="italic">Elden Ring</em> — allows you to leave short messages with specific words, but you can also use emotes and the message will play your character as a ghost with your small message and the emote. This allows interaction with the emotes that you may have found. This is a very interesting way to allow interaction within a game that is defined by its ability to make you feel alone and weak.</p>
<p class="normal">After <a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>they are done playing, take all your notes and thank them for their time. You do not need to <a id="_idIndexMarker787"/>implement everything you wrote down from their test, but after you have five people test it, there will be trends. Take care of those trends first.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-276">Soak testing</h2>
<p class="normal">Soak testing<a id="_idIndexMarker788"/> isn’t an intuitive name. We aren’t going to dunk our computers <a id="_idIndexMarker789"/>into a bath; we will just let the game run for 24 hours idly. Your character is in the game, live, just sitting by itself while the game plays out. The reason for this is to attempt to bring out any possible memory leaks in the game. </p>
<p class="normal">A memory leak is <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>when there is some memory that isn’t being taken care of somewhere. Let’s say we have a particle that is falling from a tree for some nice ambiance. The particle is set to die, but an accidental couple of extra 0s were added so now instead of lasting for 10 seconds, it’s lasting for 1000 seconds. This might not be a problem when you are running around in the game as when you leave, the particles will get culled. But if you let the game idle, all the particle systems making leaves will pile up and several thousand leaves on the ground might cause performance to tank hard. This would need fixing, and wouldn’t have been possible without soak testing.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-277">Localization testing</h2>
<p class="normal">Localization<a id="_idIndexMarker791"/> is the act of translating the game to be experienced<a id="_idIndexMarker792"/> in another language. This test can take longer than expected and you need to be patient. Every menu item, dialogue line, and description needs to be considered for this testing portion. Translation also isn’t just a word-for-word explanation. Some languages require more context for their descriptions, which can lead to very confusing translations if not paid close attention to.</p>
<p class="normal">When localizing a game, take care not to rush this process. It can completely throw off another culture’s experience, which would be a shame!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-278">User experience, or UX</h1>
<p class="normal">UX can<a id="_idIndexMarker793"/> be defined as the sum of the parts within branding, design, and usability. For our part, we will briefly cover how branding plays its part in the UX role. We will then speak about design only a little bit as we’ve covered design for the fundamental parts of this project already. After we cover those quickly, we can then move into usability. Let’s go for it!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-279">Branding</h2>
<p class="normal">To <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>cover this broadly, branding through a UX lens is about how the overall experience the user will take through the journey of the game will need to also be reflected in the branding. For an overly contrasted example, think about if a horror game ‘s branding used soft tones and pastels with flowers and happy music as their marketing material. This obviously doesn’t fit the branding of the game and will cause dissonance in the user’s experience. </p>
<p class="normal">The purpose and point of UX as a defined part of development is that deliberate cohesive actions are paid attention to. The time spent on UX should ensure that all the designed parts, including the logo, marketing material, and the game parts, are part of a whole, unified experience.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-280">Design</h2>
<p class="normal">We’ve covered a <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>lot of design in this book so far. Interestingly, we’ve covered all of our design in a bit of a siloed manner. Sometimes this can cause an issue, but luckily for our project we really focused this game on the character design. The rest of the design was built around the past of her race, which provided answers to questions for visual cues. </p>
<p class="normal">The pacing of the game is dealt with through the style of gameplay and mechanics being focused on environmental narratives. With those three parts combined, it turned out to be a cohesive project already. This does a good job of validating the time we spent on design within every part. Good job sticking with it!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-281">Usability</h2>
<p class="normal">After you’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker796"/>hooked a user through your exquisite branding and intelligent and cohesive design, they should be able to use the product. For games, usability is all focused on interactions. This shouldn’t be much surprise as we’ve defined this as a pillar for experience in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Interactions and Mechanics</em>. We’ve worked<a id="_idIndexMarker797"/> through overall interaction with the player; however, there is no defined affordance. We need to work through how the player knows they can perform the interactions. </p>
<p class="normal">We will go over the major portions of the vertical slice here, starting with the initial problem of getting to the first puzzle, then moving on to the first puzzle itself. After that, we need to bring about how the next mechanic, telekinesis, will be introduced, and then lastly the final puzzle.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-282">Initial problem</h2>
<p class="normal">Within the <a id="_idIndexMarker798"/>starting cave section, we have a blocked stairway where the player needs to interact with two objects to unlock. There are several things we will use to give affordance to the player, so they know how to perform the needed task:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Light pooling</li>
<li class="bulletList">Worldspace UI</li>
<li class="bulletList">Satisfy the action</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Light pooling is a small part of environment or level design that allows the player to feel as though they should be heading in that direction. If a tunnel is dark and there is a light at the end, the player will tend to head toward that light. We can use this method to have glowing objects or lights near a button that needs to be pressed.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that they are near it, when they mouse near enough, we will pop up a worldspace UI for interaction. This button should be the same as every other interaction of this type. For this game, our interaction is the <em class="italic">E</em> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p class="normal">After you use the interactive button, there needs to be something that satisfies the use of that action. In this case, it’s a button in a rock. It will animate to set itself in place, glow from being used, and trigger a sound to fully indicate that the user used their affordance.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-283">First puzzle</h2>
<p class="normal">When you first <a id="_idIndexMarker799"/>come up to the first puzzle, it may not be immediately understood that the player’s purpose is to move the stones into a position. We used one primary key usability feature, among others which will seem similar. Let’s list them out again:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Light pooling</li>
<li class="bulletList">Hero art piece</li>
<li class="bulletList">Worldspace UI</li>
<li class="bulletList">Camera positioning (the key factor previously mentioned)</li>
<li class="bulletList">Satisfy the action</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">We<a id="_idIndexMarker800"/> previously went over light pooling as a concept for positioning. In this case, we will be using light pooling to draw visual attention to a place to move to. The thing to look at is the door as it has the answer to the puzzle laid out in front of you.</p>
<p class="normal">The art piece we are light pooling to is the answer to the puzzle. It’s directly placed at the next position you are headed and right in front of you when you exit the stairs, and it’s lit up. There is no barrier to entry on what you should be looking at when you get to the top of the stairs. That is what we like to do for our players. Let them get a feel for exploration but know they are looking at the right place when they do.</p>
<p class="normal">Our worldspace UI is the same as before, but we are using it to let the player know they can interact with the puzzle piece when they get close to the moveable pieces.</p>
<p class="normal">The key factor to moving in the next section is the camera movement. When you enter the space of the puzzle, the camera will gently move up to a position that will represent the successful movement of the pillars in coordination with the art piece on the door when you first entered.</p>
<p class="normal">After the player moves the pillars into position, there are loud sounds of rocks being put into place and connections of what might sound like a large lock tumbler falling into place. When the final pillar is in place, the entire piece moves into the finalized complete position and the camera moves back to their shoulder while a pillar rises in the middle to allow the player to press the “door open” button.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-284">Introduction to a secondary mechanic</h2>
<p class="normal">We’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker801"/>been explaining players’ affordances and how to get them to do the actions. You can add new mechanics without breaking the experience as long as you take care to introduce them in a deliberate manner. So far, Myvari has only been an explorer. We want her to have slight telekinesis powers from her ancient blood. We could just have them active and put something in her way, but that isn’t very fun, and the experience isn’t as strong. </p>
<p class="normal">To get ourselves a new mechanic and hopefully draw the player into caring about our main character, what we will do is give two actions that at first don’t directly involve the player, but they do involve Myvari. The first thing that we will do is, while walking out in a thin area on the side of the mountain, we will have a large rock come tumbling down the mountain. There will be a cinematic that will happen where she will be alarmed, and she will defend herself by putting up her arm, which triggers her telekinesis just slightly, and she will maneuver the rock to the side slightly so that is crashes down the mountain instead of on top of Myvari herself.</p>
<p class="normal">Next, after<a id="_idIndexMarker802"/> some small exploration, the player will come across an area where they cannot enter the next area, but can see it. There is a pillar that looks like the one that opened the first door from the first puzzle, but it’s separated. We will use a new form of worldspace UI and when you hover over the broken piece, it will be outlined and the interact button will pop up. This outline will have a similar color to what was used when the telekinesis happened with the rock and when you interact with it, you will put your hand out and pick it up. It will, when close enough to the pillar, automatically fix itself, which triggers many visual changes to the area you are in.</p>
<p class="normal">In conclusion, we are using small examples of telekinesis to introduce this slowly and in a way that befits the character. This is a good use of usability as the player gets to grow with the character. We can now take what we learned here and push it into the final puzzle, which uses this telekinesis as a primary mechanic.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-285">Final puzzle</h2>
<p class="normal">It’s <a id="_idIndexMarker803"/>interesting how much effort it takes to make an experience strong! Those lead-up efforts for describing a mechanic are the glue that makes the experience a matter of immersion instead of just another button to press to make the character do something.</p>
<p class="normal">We now enter the final puzzle and there are similar means for player affordances that you’ve seen previously. We will use slightly different means as the items used in the mechanic are different, but the overall concept is driven by the environment. You will see these UX usability functions in the final puzzle area:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Light pooling</li>
<li class="bulletList">Connection to the hero art piece</li>
<li class="bulletList">Worldspace UI</li>
<li class="bulletList">Satisfy the action</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">As always, we use lighting to help our players understand the next move subtly. There is a large light coming from behind our hero piece (main focus) tree, meaning it has narrative implications and needed more authored treatment, which shows a glow coming from each of the cables attached to the architecture. If you follow the cables, they flow through large pillars.</p>
<p class="normal">Those <a id="_idIndexMarker804"/>pillars are connected to the hero art piece, which is the central tree. The thing is that the pillars themselves are missing something. That something is on the ground in multiple locations around the tree’s area. Moving your mouse to look at these larger spherical objects shows you can interact with them.</p>
<p class="normal">The interaction, in this case, is the worldspace UI. This is the outline that we already saw previously coming across the water bridge when we picked up the piece to complete the pillar. Picking up the object and moving it near the empty location with the same shape lights up the cables, which needs to be done in a certain order to get power to the tree. This is only slowed down by the character’s ability to notice some cabling is broken or not connected properly. </p>
<p class="normal">Satisfying the action comes from the nice energy flowing from the cables toward the tree with each placement of the object. By the end, the tree will light up in a cinematic and open a section that reveals a tiara. Myvari grabs the tiara and places it on her head to unlock her place as the final princess of her ancient race.</p>
<p class="normal">This ends the vertical slice when the portal turns on from the completion of the puzzle and she walks through it, excited for the next step of the adventure.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-286">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">You might be thinking, “what’s next?” This is a great question. You have a game that is built and has gone through some testing with some bug fixes. It’s a playable item in this case and could provide plenty of context to investors to continue the journey of getting a game funded or published.</p>
<p class="normal">What we will go over next are polishing techniques to try for beauty and UX to take the front seat. We’re calling these finishing touches as we know that the vertical slice is in a good state to add final touches to it only. Take some time in the next chapter to see all the tasks we can do to push our brand and quality into the game.</p>
