<h1 id="_idParaDest-67" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor073" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>User Interface and Input Systems in Unity</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we’ve discussed various design considerations for developing user interfaces, we can start discussing how to implement them within Unity. Unity provides various systems for creating UI. It has systems in place that allow you to create a UI that will be displayed in your game, or UI that will be displayed only in the Editor. Additionally, it provides multiple systems for receiving input from <span>the player.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">At the time of writing, two of these systems are still in active development and do not come packaged in Unity by default. This book will primarily focus on development with the systems that are complete, but since Unity does intend to make these systems standard features at some point, I would be remiss not to discuss them just because they are still <span>in </span><span><strong class="bold">preview</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, I will discuss the <span>following topics:</span></p>

<li class="calibre14">Choosing between the Input Manager and the <span>Input System</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s start by looking at the three UI systems <span>within Unity.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-68" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor074" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The three UI systems</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Unity has three systems that can be<a id="_idIndexMarker125" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> used to build UI. Which you choose will depend on where your UI will be displayed, what you are trying to accomplish, whether you’re working on a pre-existing project, and how comfortable you are <span>with coding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The UI you build can either be in-game or in-Editor. In-game UI is the UI that can be accessed by your players. In-Editor UI is UI that displays within the Unity Editor and assists <span>with development.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">If you want to build UI for your game or application, you can choose between the Unity UI (uGUI) system or the UI Toolkit. If you want to build UI that appears in your Unity Editor, you can use either the UI <a id="_idIndexMarker126" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Toolkit or IMGUI. The following Venn diagram summarizes the uses of the different <span>UI systems:</span></p>

<p class="calibre3">Looking at <span><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>, you may be thinking, “Well, UI Toolkit works for everything! I’m just going to learn that and be done with my UI learning journey! That was an easy choice!” Well, unfortunately, it’s not that simple. Let’s look at the different systems a little more in-depth so that you can decide which is right <span>for you.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-69" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor075" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Unity UI (or uGUI)</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The <strong class="bold">Unity UI</strong> system, also known as <strong class="bold">uGUI</strong>, is the system that is built into Unity <em class="italic">out of the box</em> and doesn’t require any additional downloads. It is GameObject and Component-based and includes multiple types of UI <a id="_idIndexMarker127" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>elements to choose from. When it comes to developing UI for a game or application, this is the most robust and stable option. Since this is the only system for building in-game UI that is not in preview mode and is included within Unity, the majority of this text will focus on how to develop UI using <span>this system.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-70" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor076" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>IMGUI</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The <strong class="bold">IMGUI</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Immediate Mode GUI</strong>, system is a code-based GUI system used to make interfaces within the editor. Its primary function is to assist programmers with development, and it is not recommended for the <a id="_idIndexMarker128" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>development of in-game UI due to performance issues. Due to the fact that this system is not intended to be used in-game and this <a id="_idIndexMarker129" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>book will primarily concern itself with UI development for games, I won’t spend a significant amount of time covering it, but I will discuss some of its basic functionality and usage in <a href="B18327_19.xhtml#_idTextAnchor501" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 19</em></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-71" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor077" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>UI Toolkit</h2>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">UI Toolkit</strong> is a new UI system that is in active development. It is not included within the engine by default and must be downloaded with the<a id="_idIndexMarker130" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> Package Manager. Additionally, it is <a id="_idIndexMarker131" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>a preview package, which means you have to elect to even see it in the list of available packages provided by Unity. Unity does plan on replacing both uGUI and IMGUI with UI Toolkit eventually. UI Toolkit is being designed with traditional web-development concepts and is structured entirely differently than the GameObject-based uGUI. In <a href="B18327_18.xhtml#_idTextAnchor481" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 18</em></span></a>, I will cover how to download the UI Toolkit package and how to work <span>with it.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-72" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor078" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Choosing between the UI systems</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Which system you choose to <a id="_idIndexMarker132" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>use is going to depend on a few things. As discussed earlier, whether you are making UI for the Editor or a game will determine which system you choose. If you’re working on UI for a game, you can use Unity UI or UI Toolkit. If you’re working on UI for the Editor, you can use IMGUI or <span>UI Toolkit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">UI Toolkit is a new system that is not fully implemented, so if you are working on a pre-existing game with UI already in place, you probably won’t be using UI Toolkit. It also may not have all the features <a id="_idIndexMarker133" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>you are looking to work with. Because UI Toolkit is in development, it is not guaranteed to be stable, and updating it mid-development may adversely affect <span>your project.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Your comfort with coding could also drive your decision. In general, the coding required to use Unity UI is less intensive<a id="_idIndexMarker134" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> than IMGUI and may be more familiar to you than UI Toolkit, since it is GameObject-based. However, if you are familiar with web-based UI creation, UI Toolkit may seem really familiar <span>to you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">If you are considering using the UI Toolkit, I recommend reviewing the examples in this book, as well as the following Unity documentation page, before you make your decision on which system to <span>use: </span><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UI-system-compare.xhtml" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span>https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UI-system-compare.xhtml</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we’ve reviewed the three UI systems provided by Unity, we can review the two <span>input systems.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-73" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor079" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The two input systems</h1>
<p class="calibre3">As defined in <a href="B18327_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <strong class="bold">UI</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">user interface</strong> and encompasses all mechanisms by which the user and the <a id="_idIndexMarker135" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>game convey information to each other. When discussing the three UI <a id="_idIndexMarker136" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>systems, we talked about three ways in which the game communicates with the user – specifically through the use of GUI on an output device (i.e., a screen). However, if the user wants to communicate with the game, the user will have to have some means through which they can provide input. The game will then need to process <span>that input.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">There are two core ways in which Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker137" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>can handle input. The <strong class="bold">Input Manager</strong> or the <strong class="bold">Input System</strong>. Just as there are<a id="_idIndexMarker138" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> varying factors that would determine which UI system you may use, there are also varying factors that can help you determine which input system to use. Both systems allow you to easily process multiple types of input as if they are the same thing. For example, each system will let you process a keyboard space bar and an Xbox controller A button as if they are the same type of input. How they do that will be discussed more thoroughly in later chapters, but for now, let’s just look at the general differences between <span>the two.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-74" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor080" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The Input Manager</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The Input Manager is the input system that <a id="_idIndexMarker139" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>comes with Unity by default and does not require any additional package downloads. Without having to configure any settings, you can easily accept input from <a id="_idIndexMarker140" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>things such as a keyboard, mouse, joystick, or touchscreen. It achieves this by providing pre-defined <em class="italic">input axes</em> that essentially specify keywords and buttons that bind to them. We will review how this functions more thoroughly in <a href="B18327_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor147" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-75" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor081" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The new Input System</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The Input System (colloquially referred to as <em class="italic">the new Input System</em>) is a package that is currently in development and is, as Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker141" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>states in its documentation, <em class="italic">intended to be more powerful, flexible, and configurable</em> than the Input <span>Manager: </span><a href="mailto:https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.3/manual/index.xhtml" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span>https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.3/manual/index.xhtml</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">If you have been working on<a id="_idIndexMarker142" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> a project that is using the Input Manager, it is possible to convert your project to one that uses the new Input System. We will discuss how to implement the Input System in <a href="B18327_20.xhtml#_idTextAnchor513" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 20</em></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-76" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor082" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Choosing between the Input System and the new Input System</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Let me start by saying there’s not necessarily a right answer on which system you choose. You can theoretically process any type of input you wish with either system. Which you choose will primarily be based on preference, how complicated your project’s set of inputs is, and whether <a id="_idIndexMarker143" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>you are developing for <span>multiple platforms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">If you are not planning on allowing your player to remap controls (as discussed in <a href="B18327_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>) or are not planning on cross-platform development, you are probably fine with using the Input Manager and don’t need to go through the process of downloading the Input System. However, if you want to have ultra-configurable control schemes, accept inputs from a variety of devices, and accept complicated input actions, you will likely find it easier to write the code that processes these inputs using the Input System than you would using the <span>Input Manager.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Since the Input Manager is used in so many projects that are currently in development, I would be doing you a disservice to completely omit it just because it is not the <em class="italic">new hot</em>. Additionally, the new Input System is still new and still in active development, so it is subject to drastic changes with <a id="_idIndexMarker144" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>each update. However, it does make some things significantly easier to build and is gaining traction in popularity among developers. Therefore, I will not choose just one of these systems to focus on in <span>this book.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-77" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor083" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Summary</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Unity provides multiple ways in which you can display information to your user through the use of three UI systems. Which you choose depends on your needs and whether you are developing UI for a game or the Editor. This book will primarily focus on uGUI, since it is the most stable UI version used for in-game development and is provided within Unity, without additional downloads. However, how you can use IMGUI to develop Editor UI and the UI Toolkit to use both Editor UI and in-game UI will be discussed in the later chapters of <span>this book.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Unity also provides multiple ways in which you can process inputs from a user. While the new Input System is still in development and does not come with Unity by default, I will make sure to give you enough information to use it in <span>your projects.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next chapter, we will start developing UI using the uGUI system, by exploring UI Canvases, Panels, <span>and layouts.</span></p>
