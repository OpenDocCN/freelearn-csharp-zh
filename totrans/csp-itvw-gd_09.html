			<h2 id="_idParaDest-512" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor511" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Can you explain the concept of recursion in programming and provide examples of its application in C#?</h2>
			<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Recursion</strong> is a programming technique where a function<a id="_idIndexMarker969" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> calls itself either directly or indirectly. Recursion can be useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar tasks. In C#, recursion can be implemented by creating a method that calls itself with a condition to exit to avoid an infinite loop. Examples include recursive implementation of the factorial calculation algorithm or a tree traversal algorithm. Utilizing recursion can often lead to more elegant and simpler solutions for problems that are naturally recursive, although you must be cautious to avoid stack overflow; you can do this by defining a clear <span>base case.</span></p>

			<p class="calibre3">In C#, attributes can be used<a id="_idIndexMarker982" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> to add metadata to assemblies, classes, methods, and more. They allow you to specify additional information that can be utilized at runtime for various purposes, such as object serialization or access control. Here’s a basic example of using an attribute to annotate <span>a method:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
[Obsolete("This method is deprecated, use NewMethod instead.")]
public void OldMethod()
{
    // ...
}</pre>
			<p class="calibre3">The preceding snippet demonstrates <a id="_idIndexMarker983" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>how attributes can be used to annotate code with metadata, thereby providing guidelines or restrictions that assist in code management <span>and documentation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-523" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor522" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>How can you implement the Observer pattern in C# to create an event notification system?</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The <strong class="bold">Observer</strong> pattern can be implemented in C# using<a id="_idIndexMarker984" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> delegates and events. In this pattern, observers subscribe to notifications from a specific object (subject) and receive notifications when certain events occur. Here is a <span>basic example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public class Subject
{
    public event EventHandler&lt;string&gt; Notify;
    public void TriggerEvent(string message)
    {
        Notify?.Invoke(this, message);
    }
}
public class Observer
{
    public void OnNotify(object sender, string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Observer received: " + message);
    }
}
// Usage:
 var subject = new Subject();
