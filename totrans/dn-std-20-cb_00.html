<p class="mce-root">This book is a step-by-step guide to building .NET Standard 2.0 Library and its usage in various .NET platforms. Also, we will demonstrate the usage of the library using ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, Xamarin iOS, and Xamarin Android. Finally, we will guide you through how to package and send your library using the NuGet package manager.</p>

<p>This book is for developers who need to get in touch with the new .NET Standard 2.0 Library. If you have a basic knowledge of C# and what a library can do to your code, that's enough to understand this book. Also, if you are a developer who writes third-party libraries, this will give you a fair idea of what .NET Standard 2.0 Library is and how you can cater to various .NET based platforms in Windows, Linux, and macOS using it.</p>
