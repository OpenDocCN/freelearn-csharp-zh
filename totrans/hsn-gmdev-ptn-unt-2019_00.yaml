- en: The preceding quote from one of my favorite films sums up my approach to learning.
    Following over a decade working in the gaming industry, I have found that the
    only valid way to gain mastery over a complex system is by breaking it down into
    its most basic components. In other words, I try to understand the core ingredients
    before mastering the final form.

- en: You will see that throughout this book, I'm taking a very simplistic approach
    in the way I present each pattern. The goal is not to dump down the subject matter,
    but learn by isolating the core concepts behind each design pattern so that we
    can observe them and learn their intricacies. I've learned this approach in the
    gaming industry while working as a designer and programmer. We will often build
    components and systems for our game in isolated levels that we call *gyms*. We
    would spend weeks iterating, testing, and adjusting each ingredient of our game
    individually until we understood how to make them work as a whole.

- en: I wrote this book in a way that's consistent with how I approach game development
    so you, as a reader, can immerse yourself in the subject matter while taking some
    good habits along the way that will help you in your career.

- en: Even if the code included in each chapter is not what we call *production-ready*,
    it still offers a good starting point to build robust systems for your game. Hence,
    it's important to keep in mind that the code in this book is not dogma, but learning
    material that is meant to be improved by you, the reader. And I hope you do so!

- en: This book was written for beginner and experienced Unity developers. But it
    was also designed to be a reference for developers who are switching to Unity
    from other development environments and who wish to know how they can apply design
    patterns while using the core features of Unity's API.
