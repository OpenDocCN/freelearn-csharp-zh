  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: .NET Core has undergone significant evolution since its inception and has emerged
    as a robust solution for building a wide array of applications, including web,
    desktop, mobile, gaming, and AI applications. With the release of .NET 8 at the
    end of 2023, it solidified its position as one of the most powerful and versatile
    frameworks for modern applications.

- en: ASP.NET Core, built on top of the .NET Core platform, inherits its strengths,
    offering cross-platform compatibility, exceptional performance, and a modular
    architecture. It has become a popular choice for building cloud-native applications
    that can run seamlessly on any operating system, including Windows, macOS, and
    Linux, and can be deployed on any cloud platform, such as Azure, AWS, or GCP.

- en: As organizations increasingly adopt ASP.NET Core for web application development,
    the demand for ASP.NET Core developers is on the rise. Whether you’re transitioning
    from the traditional .NET Framework or are new to web API development with ASP.NET
    Core, this book is tailored to meet your needs. It will guide you through building
    your first web API application with ASP.NET Core and provide you with the knowledge
    and skills to build robust, scalable, and maintainable web APIs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While ASP.NET Core offers robust options for frontend development, such as Razor
    Pages, Blazor, and MVC, this book focuses on backend development. You’ll explore
    a range of topics, including REST-based APIs, gRPC APIs, GraphQL APIs, and real-time
    APIs, gaining insights into essential concepts and best practices for building
    web APIs with ASP.NET Core.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, we’ll delve into testing methodologies and tools such as unit
    testing and integration testing to ensure the quality and reliability of your
    web APIs. We’ll also explore modern development practices such as CI/CD, containerization,
    monitoring, and cloud-native design patterns, essential for contemporary web API
    development.

- en: While this book serves as a foundational resource, it merely scratches the surface
    of what ASP.NET Core has to offer. I encourage you to use it as a stepping stone
    to further explore the vast landscape of ASP.NET Core on your own. Experiment
    with the sample code provided and refer to the links in the book for more in-depth
    learning. Don’t forget to explore the official documentation for the latest updates
    and features.

    It is only available on Windows. If you are using a Mac or Linux, you can use
    a Docker container to run SQL Server. You can also use SQLite instead. To use
    SQLite, you need to update the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file
    and install the SQLite provider for EF Core, respectively. Please refer to [*Chapter
    5*](B18971_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor198) for more details.
