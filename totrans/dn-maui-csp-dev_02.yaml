- en: During the course of this book, we will build the core of a complete non-trivial
    application called *Forget Me Not*. It is easiest to get somewhere when you know
    where you are going, so this chapter will review the finished product from a user’s
    point of view. That is, in this chapter, we’ll review the functionality, and in
    subsequent chapters, we’ll dive into the implementation.

    on the right! This gives you the maximum flexibility in specifying your preferences
    and your taste in various potential present categories.

    your relationship is established in the cloud-based database, you can see your
    Buddy’s preferences, and they can see yours (though you cannot edit each other’s
    preferences).
