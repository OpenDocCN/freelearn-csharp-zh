You have learned how to move the panels around within the Unity window in order to organize your workflow and how to change some of the project settings.</p><p>In this chapter, we will take a closer look at each Unity panel and interface element you have encountered so far, as well as some of those you have not seen, including the Playmaker's <strong>Actions</strong> panel and the <strong>Finite State Machine</strong> (<strong>FSM</strong>) <a id="id24" class="indexterm"/>view. You will also learn how to create simple game objects and modify their properties, such as position, location, and scale.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec13"/>Interface overview and main menu</h1></div></div></div><p>Unity's interface is<a id="id25" class="indexterm"/> modular: this means that you can drag its elements around, attach them <a id="id26" class="indexterm"/>to different parts of the Editor window or even detach them completely and put them on another screen for convenience. Editor is everything you see when you open Unity: panels, views, controls, and so on. <em>Editor</em> is how Unity itself is called within Unity. Let us take a look at the main interface elements.</p><p>There is the main menu<a id="id27" class="indexterm"/> on the top <a id="id28" class="indexterm"/>of the screen. Yours should include <strong>File</strong>, <strong>Edit</strong>, <strong>Assets</strong>, <strong>GameObject</strong>, <strong>Component</strong>, <strong>PlayMaker</strong>, <strong>Window</strong>, and <strong>Help</strong> submenus. They will help you create game objects (for example, primitives, lights, and cameras), attach components, and open new panels and views. The submenus can be explained as follows:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">
<p>Submenus</p>

<p>Description</p>
</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p><strong>File</strong></p>
</td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>This<a id="id29" class="indexterm"/> submenu contains all the commands about building, saving, and opening projects and scenes. There are three commands here that you will use quite often, so it is a good idea to remember hotkeys for them: <em>command</em> + <em>S</em> (<em>Ctrl</em> + <em>S</em> in Windows) to save the current scene, <em>command</em> + <em>N</em> (<em>Ctrl</em> + <em>N</em> in Windows) to create a new scene, and <em>command</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>B</em> (<em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>B</em> in Windows) to open the <strong>Build Settings</strong> window.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
</td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>This <a id="id30" class="indexterm"/>submenu lets you perform various operations on files and game objects, such as copying (<em>command</em> + <em>C</em> or <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>C</em> in Windows), pasting (<em>command</em> + <em>V</em> or <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>V</em> in Windows), duplicating (<em>command</em> + <em>D</em> or <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>D</em> in Windows), and deleting (<em>command</em> +<em>Delete</em> or just <em>Delete</em> in Windows). There are also undo (<em>command</em> + <em>Z</em> or <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Z</em> in Windows) and redo (<em>command</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>Z</em> or <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>Z</em> in Windows) commands under it. These are all standard commands that are the same across your operating system, so you should just assume that they work the same as they do in Finder (Windows Explorer) or TextEdit (Windows Notepad).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p><strong>Assets</strong></p>
</td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>This <a id="id31" class="indexterm"/>submenu lets you create, import, and export files, also known as assets using the game development term. These can be scripts, animations, shaders, materials, and so on. The list of assets that are currently in your project can be seen in the <strong>Project</strong> panel. You will use commands available through this submenu later on in this chapter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p><strong>GameObject</strong></p>
</td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>This submenu lets you create new game objects. Not unlike the way the <strong>Assets</strong> submenu is linked to the <strong>Project</strong> panel, the <strong>GameObject</strong> submenu is linked to the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel. You will learn more about different types of game objects later when we talk about the panels and views in Unity. For now just remember that you can create a new empty game object by pressing <em>command</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>N</em> (<em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>N</em> in Windows). This is something you will be doing a lot while working in Unity.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p><strong>Component</strong></p>
</td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>This <a id="id32" class="indexterm"/>submenu lets you add new components to your game objects. This is very important, because an empty game object does not do anything, and it is invisible. By adding components to it, you can change its appearance and behavior. We will talk about components in more detail in the next chapter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p><strong>PlayMaker</strong></p>
</td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>This <a id="id33" class="indexterm"/>submenu is not a default Unity submenu; it was added to the main menu by the Playmaker plugin that you imported from the Asset Store. This Playmaker-dedicated submenu lets you access Playmaker components and panels, such as the FSM view and its panel that allow you to choose new actions and transitions for your objects. We will look at Playmaker later on in this and the following chapters.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p><strong>Window</strong></p>
</td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>This <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>submenu lets you open new panels and views, such as <strong>Asset Store</strong>, <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, and<strong> Scene</strong>. This submenu is useful if you have lost or accidentally closed one of your panels or views and want to find or open it again. It doesn't allow you to open multiple instances of the same interface elements, so you will always find the existing panel if it is open already.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p><strong>Help</strong></p>
</td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>This <a id="id35" class="indexterm"/>submenu allows you to access <a id="id36" class="indexterm"/>useful Unity reference resources, such as Unity Manual, Reference Material, and Scripting Reference. There are copies of these available on the web, but it is always a good idea to use the ones provided with your installation: this way you are making sure that the documentation you are using is consistent with your version of Unity, plus the local copy of the documentation always works faster. The <strong>Help</strong> submenu also provides shortcuts to Unity's community sites, such as forum, answers, and feedback, and lets you report bugs and check for updates.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Now, below the main menu is the toolbar that includes (left to right) main controls for the <strong>Scene</strong> view, game execution controls, and drop-down boxes of layer filter and layout selection.</p><div><img src="img/8108OT_02_01.jpg" alt="Interface overview and main menu"/></div><p>Under the<a id="id37" class="indexterm"/> toolbar you will see the panel and the view tabs. We will look at them closer later in this chapter, but for now you just need to know that there is a distinction between views that include <strong>Scene</strong> and <strong>Game</strong> and panels that include <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, <strong>Console</strong>, <strong>Project</strong>, and <strong>Inspector</strong>. Panels and views can all be manipulated, resized, detached, and attached in the same way, but the difference between them is that views (as the name suggests) let you see your game scene in one way or another, while panels provide additional information and tools for game objects, the scene, or the project as a whole.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip06"/>Tip</h3><p>Keep in mind that the distinction between views and panels is merely a helpful convention and by no means limits the functionality of a tab. This is especially true of custom tabs added by various plugins or, indeed, by yourself. In this book this distinction is made for convenience.</p></div></div><p>The following figure shows what your Editor window is supposed to look like if you haven't moved any tabs around since <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker</em>. We will be referring to this layout throughout this chapter, so if your layout differs, I suggest you change it to match the image. You can always go back to it later.</p><div><img src="img/8108OT_02_02.jpg" alt="Interface overview and main menu"/></div><p>On the very <a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>bottom of the Unity Editor window there is a long empty gray line. This is the status bar: it shows the last thing displayed in the <strong>Console</strong> panel, and clicking on it reveals the <strong>Console</strong>, highlighting the last log message in it. The status bar, the main menu, and the toolbar are all permanent interface elements in Unity and, unlike the tabs, cannot be closed, detached, or resized without manipulating the Editor window itself.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec06"/>Hierarchy panel</h2></div></div></div><p>A panel in Unity is a<a id="id39" class="indexterm"/> tab that provides information about or gives you additional <a id="id40" class="indexterm"/>control over a game object, a scene, or the project as a whole. Panels can be added, closed, detached, and attached at will. You can drag them around as you see fit in order to optimize your workflow. If you followed the instructions in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker</em>, your current layout should match that of the last screenshot in the previous section of this chapter.</p><p>To begin, let us look at the Hierarchy panel (you should have it attached on the left of the Editor window).</p><p>The place where you see the word <strong>Hierarchy</strong> written is the tab's header. You can drag any tab by its header, be it a view or a panel. Any number of panels can be present in any position in the Editor, so sometimes you will have a situation when you have multiple tabs attached to the same area of the screen (as on the following figure):</p><div><img src="img/8108OT_02_03.jpg" alt="Hierarchy panel"/></div><p>Let us try to reproduce this situation. Click the <strong>Options</strong> (<img src="img/8108OT_02_04.jpg" alt="Hierarchy panel"/>) button in the top-right corner of the Hierarchy panel. Then hover the <strong>Add Tab</strong> option from the drop-down list and, finally, click on <strong>Hierarchy</strong>. Now you should have two <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panels attached to the same side of the screen. Their headers should be next to each other: one of them active, and the other one inactive. The active panel is the one that has a lighter color.</p><p>The following figure<a id="id41" class="indexterm"/> shows the menu that allows you to add new tabs to a <a id="id42" class="indexterm"/>certain area of the screen; in this case it is on the right, in the same place where the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel is. Use it to add another <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel.</p><div><img src="img/8108OT_02_05.jpg" alt="Hierarchy panel"/></div><p>Click on the inactive panel's header to see its contents. At this point you should see that both panels look exactly the same: the only thing inside both is <strong>Main Camera</strong>. This is because both panels show the contents of the same scene. You can have as many <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panels as you want, but they will all show exactly the same thing. We don't need two of them, so let us close one: right click on one of the Hierarchy tabs' headers and choose <strong>Close Tab</strong> from the contextual menu that appears. Note that this is the same menu that appears when you click on the <strong>Options</strong> button in the top-right corner of the panel. This is just another way of doing the same thing.</p><p>I have just mentioned something called scene and a scene's contents—but what does it mean? A project in Unity is composed of scenes; think of them as level files if you like, except apart from the actual game levels, scenes can contain things like intro cinematics, loading screens, game menus, or anything. This is just a convenient way of dividing your game into manageable chunks, and the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel reveals everything that is inside of the currently open scene. You can have only one scene open at any given moment, which is why no matter how many <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panels you open, they will all show the same exact thing. We will talk about scenes in more detail in the next chapter.</p><p>Another thing that you should notice is the <strong>Create</strong> button in the top-left corner of the panel just below the header. Click on it, and you will see the same menu that you would see if you navigated to <strong>GameObject</strong> | <strong>Other</strong> from the main menu. This menu allows you to create game objects that are added to the current scene when you click on their names in the list.</p><p>A game object in Unity is kind of a shell, a container that can be anything: a cube, a light, a camera, or a character. Go ahead and create a cube, a quad, and a directional light. We will use these in the following chapters to create a game.</p><p>Now that we have <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>all these game objects, we want to position them in<a id="id44" class="indexterm"/> a certain way in the scene. To do this, we are going to use the Inspector panel, among other things.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec07"/>Inspector panel</h2></div></div></div><p>The main purpose of the <a id="id45" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Inspector</strong> panel is performing various actions on game <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>objects, including changing their properties, such as appearance, behavior, position, size, and rotation. Select the <strong>Cube</strong> game object in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel by clicking on it once. The appearance of the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel should now change to include a number of things displayed in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/8108OT_02_07.jpg" alt="Inspector panel"/></div><p>The first thing that you<a id="id47" class="indexterm"/> should notice is the small padlock (<img src="img/8108OT_02_08.jpg" alt="Inspector panel"/>) icon in the top-right corner of the panel next to the <strong>Options</strong> button. Unlike<a id="id48" class="indexterm"/> the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel, <strong>Inspector</strong> shows properties of an object rather than a scene, and, since you can have any number of game objects in your currently active scene at the same time, you can assign different inspectors to always focus on specific objects. Open a new <strong>Inspector</strong> tab by right-clicking the <strong>Inspector</strong> header and selecting <strong>Add Tab</strong> | <strong>Inspector</strong>. Both inspectors will be focused on the cube that you selected in <strong>Hierarchy</strong>. Click on the padlock icon in one of the inspectors. This will make this <strong>Inspector</strong> always display the properties of <strong>Cube</strong>, so, if you select <strong>Quad</strong> in <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, the locked (<img src="img/8108OT_02_09.jpg" alt="Inspector panel"/>) Inspector will continue showing the Cube's properties, while the other one will show <strong>Quad</strong>. You can verify this by clicking on the headers of the two <strong>Inspector</strong> panels that you have opened.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip07"/>Tip</h3><p>If you want to expose the properties of two objects at the same time without having to click on the headers, you can detach one of the <strong>Inspector</strong> panels by clicking and dragging its header wherever you want that panel to be. This can be helpful if you want to copy components or properties from one object to another or if you want to keep one important object always on display.</p></div></div><p>Make sure you are <a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>comfortable with the idea of having multiple inspectors and the <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>fact that they correspond to the selected game object. Also note that an <strong>Inspector</strong> panel can expose properties of multiple game objects at the same time. You can select multiple game objects in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel by pressing and holding <em>command</em> (<em>Ctrl</em> in Windows). You can also press <em>Shift</em> and select a range of game objects. These operations are similar to those you would perform in Finder (or Windows Explorer). Try doing this a few times until you are comfortable performing these actions in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel and always take note of how the contents of the unlocked <strong>Inspector</strong> panel change based on the game objects that you select. Once you feel like you have experimented enough, close the locked <strong>Inspector</strong> by right-clicking its header and selecting <strong>Close Tab</strong> from the contextual menu.</p><p>Just below the header in the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel is the name of the selected game object. You can change it however you want. For now, let us rename our <strong>Cube</strong> <code class="literal">Wall</code>. Make sure that you have <strong>Cube</strong> selected in <strong>Hierarchy</strong> and that its properties are displayed in the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel. Click within the text field where you see <strong>Cube</strong> written at the moment, delete everything, and type <code class="literal">Wall</code>, then press <em>return</em> (<em>Enter</em>). You will notice that the name has changed in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel as well.</p><p>Below the name field there is a long section with various components separated by black horizontal lines. A default cube (now called <strong>Wall</strong>) has <strong>Transform</strong>, <strong>Mesh Filter</strong>, <strong>Box Collider,</strong> and <strong>Mesh Renderer</strong> components. We will closely examine the components in the next chapter. For now you should focus on the Transform component (shown in the following image along with the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel header), which is the only component that every game object in Unity has.</p><div><img src="img/8108OT_02_10.jpg" alt="Inspector panel"/></div><p>Transform <a id="id51" class="indexterm"/>defines position, rotation, and scale of a game object in 3D space. These <a id="id52" class="indexterm"/>are all its properties. Set the position of <strong>Wall</strong> to (<code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">0.5</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>) by clicking in the <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong>, and <strong>Z</strong> fields, deleting everything in there, entering the value you want instead, and pressing <em>return</em> (<em>Enter</em>) on your keyboard. You have just changed the position property of the <strong>Transform</strong> component of the <strong>Wall</strong> game object. The next chapter will examine properties and components more closely. For now just set the positions and rotations of the game objects you have in the scene to the following values:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">

Press <em>command</em> + <em>S</em> (<em>Ctrl</em> + <em>S</em> in Windows). A dialog window should appear asking you where you would like to save your scene. By default it should offer to save it in the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder. Name your scene <code class="literal">Scene1</code> and click on <strong>Save</strong>. The following screenshot shows the path where the scene file should be saved. Note that you cannot save the scene outside of the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder. If you try, an error message will pop-up warning you about it.</p><div><img src="img/8108OT_02_11.jpg" alt="Inspector panel"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec08"/>Project panel</h2></div></div></div><p>Have a look at the <a id="id53" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Project</strong> panel: you should have four folders and a file <a id="id54" class="indexterm"/>called <code class="literal">Scene1</code> displayed there. The <strong>Project</strong> panel is your project's file browser, similar to Mac OSX Finder or Windows Explorer, but it only shows files and folders that are situated inside the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder of your project.</p><p>Unlike <strong>Hierarchy</strong> and <strong>Inspector</strong>, <strong>Project</strong> (see the following screenshot) always displays the same thing as long as you have the same Unity project open. All of the scene files, scripts, and art assets are shown and can be manipulated from here. Using the icons to the right of the search field, you can filter the things displayed in the <strong>Project</strong> panel either by tag or by type.</p><div><img src="img/8108OT_02_12.jpg" alt="Project panel"/></div><p>It is generally a good practice to keep your project's file structure well-organized, as it helps to increase productivity and save time looking for files. To organize your assets, you can put things inside folders with clear names, such as <code class="literal">Artwork</code>, <code class="literal">Scripts</code>, or <code class="literal">Music</code>. To begin with, let us try to organize what we have in our <strong>Project</strong> panel already.</p><p>Click on the<a id="id55" class="indexterm"/> <strong>Create</strong> button in the top-left corner of the panel; this should reveal a <a id="id56" class="indexterm"/>menu that allows you to create different types of assets. This is the same menu you get by going to <strong>Assets</strong> | <strong>Create</strong> in the main menu.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip08"/>Tip</h3><p>The third way to access the <strong>Assets</strong> menu is right-clicking anywhere in the empty area below the list of files in the <strong>Project</strong> panel and clicking on <strong>Create</strong> in the contextual menu that appears.</p></div></div><p>Create a folder called <code class="literal">Scenes</code>. In order to rename a folder if you forgot to enter a name when the folder was just created, press <em>return</em> (or <em>F2</em> if you are using Windows). Once you have it named appropriately, click and drag the <code class="literal">Scene1</code> file and drop it into the <code class="literal">Scenes</code> folder. From now on, we will save all of the scenes into that folder instead of the <code class="literal">Assets</code> root. This way, they will be easier to find when we want to open a specific scene.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec09"/>Views</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that the <a id="id57" class="indexterm"/>Project panel is well-organized and your objects are positioned in the scene, it is time to have a look at the view tabs: <strong>Game</strong> and <strong>Scene</strong>. The former shows the output of all the cameras, while the latter is your main workspace in Unity. This is where the level design is done. The <strong>Game</strong> view becomes interactive when you click on the play button in the toolbar (<img src="img/8108OT_02_13.jpg" alt="Views"/>) or use the hotkey <em>command</em> + <em>P</em> (or <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>P</em> in Windows), provided there is some kind of input defined in Playmaker or other components. You can also pause (<img src="img/8108OT_02_14.jpg" alt="Views"/>) the game by pressing <em>command</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>P</em> (<em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>P</em> in Windows). This is how you will test your game later. Right now there are no interactions yet, but we will get to that soon enough.</p><p>Activate the <strong>Scene</strong> view by clicking on its header if it is not active right now. In the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel, select <strong>Wall</strong> and press <em>F</em>. This will focus the <strong>Scene</strong> view on <strong>Wall</strong>. You should be seeing the cube that you created, with a <strong>Quad</strong> and <strong>Directional light</strong> gizmo below it (it looks like a little sun). A <strong>gizmo</strong><a id="id58" class="indexterm"/> is generally a 2D element in 3D space that lets you select and/or manipulate objects even if they are not represented in any other way in the scene. A gizmo can also be non-interactive, such as a simple line or a wire cube. These are generally used to reveal position or direction of something otherwise invisible.</p><div><img src="img/8108OT_02_15.jpg" alt="Views"/></div><p>Selecting an<a id="id59" class="indexterm"/> object and pressing <em>F</em> is one way to navigate the 3D space. Another way is using your mouse. You can select different objects directly in the <strong>Scene</strong> view by clicking on their meshes (3D models) or gizmos. To look around, press and hold the right mouse button while moving your mouse in the <strong>Scene</strong> view. Zoom in and out by using your scroll wheel. Use middle click to drag the view around. You can also rotate around a point by pressing and holding <em>Alt</em> and clicking the left mouse button and moving your mouse around.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Directional light</strong> gizmo and press <em>W</em> or <img src="img/8108OT_02_16.jpg" alt="Views"/> in the toolbar. You should see three arrows appear: red, green, and blue. These arrows correspond to the X, Y, and Z axes in 3D space, respectively. Clicking and dragging one of the arrows will move the object in space. Move <strong>Directional light</strong> anywhere you want: its position does not matter. What does matter, however, is its rotation.</p><p>Press <em>E</em> or <img src="img/8108OT_02_17.jpg" alt="Views"/> in the toolbar. A sphere with colored and white circles will appear around the object. Each colored circle is responsible for the object's rotation around one axis. Once again: red for X, green for Y and blue for Z. When you select your light, you should also see yellow rays coming out of it. This is a gizmo that shows in what direction your <strong>Directional light</strong> is lighting the scene. Rotate <strong>Directional light</strong> in such a way that <strong>Wall</strong> and <strong>Quad</strong> appear well-lit, almost white in the <strong>Game</strong> view. Do not forget that you can switch between the <strong>Game</strong> and <strong>Scene</strong> views at any moment to see a preview of what you will see in the game.</p><p>You can also <a id="id60" class="indexterm"/>switch between the ways your rotation, position, and scale gizmos appear by clicking the <strong>Global</strong>/<strong>Local</strong> toggle button in the toolbar. The <strong>Pivot</strong>/<strong>Center</strong> toggle button determines where it appears: in the pivot point of the object or in its geometric center.</p><p>Once you are happy with the light, select the <strong>Quad</strong> object and press <em>R</em> or <img src="img/8108OT_02_18.jpg" alt="Views"/> in the toolbar. This is the scale manipulation mode. If you press <em>F</em> to focus on <strong>Quad</strong>, you will see a gizmo similar to that of the movement manipulator, but with little colored cubes instead of arrows on the ends of each line. As before, colors correspond to axes: red for X, green for Y, and blue for Z. There is also a white cube in the middle, which is the uniform scale manipulator that allows you to change scale on all three axes at the same time.</p><p>Using this gizmo, scale <strong>Quad</strong> to be about <code class="literal">100</code> on the X and Y axes. Its Z scale should stay the same. You can check the current values of position, rotation, and scale in the <strong>Transform</strong> component in the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel when you have an object selected.</p><p>Save your scene by pressing <em>command</em> + <em>S</em> (<em>Ctrl</em> + <em>S</em> in Windows).</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec14"/>Playmaker interface</h1></div></div></div><p>It is time to finally take a look at <a id="id61" class="indexterm"/>Playmaker. In the main menu, go to <strong>PlayMaker</strong> | <strong>PlayMaker Editor</strong>. A<a id="id62" class="indexterm"/> welcome window with different Playmaker options and a <strong>playMaker</strong> panel should appear. Close the welcome window, then attach the <strong>playMaker</strong> panel to the same region of the Editor where you have your <strong>Console</strong> panel as shown in the following screenshot (this should be just below the <strong>Scene</strong> and <strong>Game</strong> views if you haven't changed anything since <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker</em>).</p><div><img src="img/8108OT_02_19.jpg" alt="Playmaker interface"/></div><p>The darker area on the left is the FSM view.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip09"/>Tip</h3><p>Keep in mind that the FSM view is called Playmaker Editor in the official Playmaker documentation. In this book we will use a clearer name, <em>FSM view</em>, to distinguish between different areas of the <strong>playMaker</strong> panel.</p></div></div><p>It is here that you <a id="id63" class="indexterm"/>will edit<a id="id64" class="indexterm"/> your finite state machines and create state nodes and transitions between them, which we will talk about in more detail in the next chapter. For now, follow the instructions given in the lower-right corner of the FSM view:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Select the <strong>Wall</strong> game object in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel or in the <strong>Scene</strong> view by clicking on it.</li><li class="listitem">Right-click anywhere in the FSM view and select <strong>Add FSM</strong> from the contextual menu that appears to add a finite state machine to the <strong>Wall</strong> game object. When you do that, note the red icon that appears next to <strong>Wall</strong> in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> panel. This icon means that the object has a Playmaker FSM component. Also note the Playmaker FSM component that appeared in the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel.</li><li class="listitem">Now you can manipulate FSM to assign various behaviors to <strong>Wall</strong>. Read all the tips displayed in the <strong>playMaker</strong> panel carefully.</li></ol></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip10"/>Tip</h3><p>To take a better look at any one of the tabs, including the <strong>playMaker</strong> panel, press the <em>Space</em> key with your mouse cursor hovering over the tab. Then press space again to minimize. You can do this with any view or panel in the Unity Editor.</p></div></div><p>On the right side of the <strong>playMaker</strong> panel, there are tabs that display and let you modify different information types, including the FSM as a whole, as well as its states, events, and variables. Click on each tab and examine the tips in grey rectangles explaining the contents of each tab. Once you are done with the tips, you can press the <strong>Hint</strong> toggle button on the bottom of the panel to disable them. You can also do this by pressing <em>F1</em>. Before you do that, click on the <strong>Preferences</strong> button next to it and read the tips there. We will examine the necessary changes to the Playmaker preferences in the next chapter.</p><p>Under the FSM view you should see controls similar to pause/play in the toolbar. These are, in fact, the same buttons, and are there just to make it more convenient for you to control the game when you are working with Playmaker.</p><p>The second most important Playmaker-related panel is the <strong>Action Browser</strong>. You can open it by selecting <strong>PlayMaker</strong> | <strong>Editor Window</strong> | <strong>Action Browser</strong> from the main menu. A part of the <strong>Actions</strong> panel is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/8108OT_02_20.jpg" alt="Playmaker interface"/></div><p>Drag it by its<a id="id65" class="indexterm"/> header to the right side of the Editor until it snaps into the same <a id="id66" class="indexterm"/>area of the screen as <strong>Inspector</strong>. This panel shows categories of actions that you have in your Playmaker library. Clicking on one of the categories, for example, <strong>Camera,</strong> will reveal the actions. There is also a search bar near the top of the panel that allows you to access the actions you need faster. When you select an action, for example, <strong>Camera</strong> | <strong>Screen To World Point</strong>, a preview of its parameters appears on the bottom of the panel. It shows what the selected action will look like in the <strong>State</strong> tab of the <strong>playMaker</strong> panel. If you have a Playmaker-enabled object and a state in the FSM view selected, you can add an action to it by clicking the <strong>Add Action To State</strong> button in the bottom-right corner of the <strong>Actions</strong> panel.</p><p>You can press the play button (or use the shortcut <em>command</em> + <em>P</em> or <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>P</em> Windows) to see that there are no errors and everything is working properly. When you are done, press play again and save the scene.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec15"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, you examined some of the main interface elements in Unity and Playmaker, added some objects to the scene and manipulated those objects. You also looked at game objects and components and learned about properties of components. These subjects will be examined in more detail in the next chapter. The scene that you created in this chapter lays a foundation for creating a game, and all objects that you have created and manipulated so far are going to be used in the final game.</p></div></body></html>
