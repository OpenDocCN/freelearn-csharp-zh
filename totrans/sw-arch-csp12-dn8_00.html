<div><h1 class="mainHeading" id="_idParaDest-4">Preface</h1>
<p class="normal">This book covers the most common design patterns and frameworks involved in modern cloud-based and distributed software architectures. It discusses when and how to use each pattern by providing you with practical, real-world scenarios.</p>
<p class="normal">This book also presents techniques and processes such as DevOps, microservices, Kubernetes, continuous integration, and cloud computing so that you can have a best-in-class software solution developed and delivered to your customers.</p>
<p class="normal">This book will help you to understand the product that your customer wants from you. It will guide you to deliver and solve the biggest problems you may face during development. It also covers the dos and don’ts that you need to follow when you manage your application in a cloud-based environment. You will learn about different architectural approaches, such as layered architectures, onion architecture, service-oriented architecture, microservices, single-page applications, and cloud architecture, and understand how to apply them to specific business requirements.</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, you will deploy code in remote environments or on the cloud using Azure.</p>
<p class="normal">All the concepts in this book will be explained with the help of a real-world practical use case where design principles make a world of difference when creating safe and robust applications. By the end of the book, you will be able to develop and deliver highly scalable and secure enterprise-ready applications that meet your end customers’ business needs.</p>
<p class="normal">It is also worth mentioning that this book will not only cover the best practices that a software architect should follow for developing C# and .NET Core solutions, but it will also discuss all the environments that you need to master in order to develop a software product based on the latest trends, such as Kubernetes, ASP .NET Core, and Blazor.</p>
<p class="normal">This fourth edition has seen improvement in terms of code, level of detail, and explanations and was adapted to the new opportunities offered by C# 12 and .NET 8.</p>
<p class="normal">Moreover, we have also added a lot of completely new content, such as a chapter dedicated to the book case study and a chapter dedicated to .NET development for Kubernetes as an extension to the case study, since we use insights from the case study to build on this chapter.</p>
