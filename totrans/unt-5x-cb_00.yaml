- en: Game development is a broad and complex task. It is an interdisciplinary field,
    covering subjects as diverse as artificial intelligence, character animation,
    digital painting, and sound editing. All these areas of knowledge can materialize
    as the production of hundreds (or thousands!) of multimedia and data assets. A
    special software application—the game engine—is required to consolidate all of
    these assets into a single product.

- en: Game engines are specialized pieces of software, which used to belong to an
    esoteric domain. They were expensive, inflexible, and extremely complicated to
    use. They were for big studios or hardcore programmers only. Then along came Unity.

    and multimedia editing environment that is user-friendly and versatile. It has
    free and Pro versions; the latter includes even more features. As we write this

- en: Today, Unity is used by a diverse community of developers all around the world.
    Some are students and hobbyists, but many are commercial organizations, ranging
    from garage developers to international studios, who use Unity to make a huge
    number of games — some you might have already played on one platform or another.

- en: This book provides over 100 Unity game development recipes. Some recipes demonstrate
    Unity application techniques for multimedia features, including working with animations
    and using preinstalled package systems. Other recipes develop game components
    with C# scripts, ranging from working with data structures and data file manipulation,
    to artificial intelligence algorithms for computer-controlled characters.
