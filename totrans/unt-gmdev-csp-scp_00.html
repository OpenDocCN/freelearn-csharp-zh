			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
IEnumerator StartDelay(float delay)
{
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(delay);
    // Action to perform after the delay
    Debug.Log("Delay completed");
}</pre>			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>.
