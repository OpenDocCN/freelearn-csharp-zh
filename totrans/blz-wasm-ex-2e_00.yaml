- en: Blazor WebAssembly is a framework that enables you to build single-page web
    applications that use C# on the client instead of JavaScript. It is built on the
    popular and robust ASP.NET framework. Blazor WebAssembly does not rely on plugins
    or add-ons for you to use C# in the browser. It only requires that the browser
    support WebAssembly, which *all* modern browsers do.

    After that, you can complete the remaining chapters in any order. The projects
    in each chapter become more complex as you proceed through the book. The final
    two chapters require a SQL Server database to complete the projects. *Chapter
    3* and *Chapter 10* require a Microsoft Azure subscription.
