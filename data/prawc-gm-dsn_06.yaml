    Only once safe, might they peek out just a little and try to return fire from
    behind the cover. Imagine if by pressing a button your character can crouch behind

- en: Addressing the need for a tactical and challenging game experience is the key
    to the creation of interesting mechanics and dynamics. It is important to note
    that realism doesn't have to always be the experience we want to give to the player.
    In fact, some game designers might want exactly the opposite. This is the case
    with games such as the latest version of Doom (2016). The idea behind the combat
    system was to go back to the roots of the FPS genre, offering visceral shootings
    and frenetic actions. How could you obtain that kind of experience if the game
    offers mechanics such as cover and stealth actions?

- en: 'To go back to the most frenetic FPS action, Doom''s game designers came up
    with a new game mechanic: Glory Kills. In short, by hammering an enemy with bullets,

- en: While performing a glory kill the player is invulnerable and the enemy always
    drops extra items such as ammunition and health. So, performing a glory kill is
    a rewarding tactical option that forces the player to approach combat in a very
    aggressive way and always move forward. All these are great examples of new game
    mechanics created from the experience we want the player to have. Let's do another

    conditions, quests to solve, leaderboard to climb, collections to complete) or
    they might enjoy setting up goals for themselves (such as completing a game without

    is, of course, its Hard Fun component. The frustration of repeatedly dying in
    the search of an optimal strategy is directly proportional to the triumph experienced

    feature or the PvP, Dark Souls provides all you need to experience People Fun.
    But again, when we talk about social fun and interactions with real players, always
    think out-of-the-box (out of the game in this case). Social Fun in video games
    comes from outside the world of the game. Games that are enjoyable just by being
    watched or eSports (such as League of Legends) that people enjoy watching as much
    as they enjoy playing offer incredible opportunities, and quite real emotions

    how a combat system feels (and on any other game mechanics) and your design should
    always be influenced and informed by the entire vision of the game you are developing.
    In modern game development, a new concept of game design has emerged, called holistic
    game Design; this means that the mechanics, aesthetics, and even every technical
    aspect of a game cannot exist as a separate entity anymore. And this is especially
    true in modern games where the level of realism is extreme. There is a great YouTube
    video that shows how awkward Battlefield 4 would be if it was using 8-bit sound

- en: In a real-time combat system, all the actions take place in a continuous time-space

    of both real-time and turn-based, but the reality is that most of the time, the
    system underneath a hybrid combat system is always a turn-based one, implemented

- en: These games, in particular, look like they run in real time, but under the hood,
    there is a turn system that determines who can attack, move, or act. As you know
    at this point, there’s no such thing as systems that are universally better than
    others. Every system and mechanic works (or doesn't work) depending on its game
    context. One important thing to note, though, is that turn-based systems are less
    dependent on the implementation of characters’ animations and actions.

- en: This means that the designer can better control them through prototyping and
    simulations, which is a precious advantage. Another interesting thing about turn-based
    systems is that not only the designers are interested in building models to simulate
    them. Part of the fun for some players who enjoy these kinds of games is, in fact,
    to build their own game models and analyze them to find the best strategies.

    Launcher in Quake had a knockback effect that players found useful for extending
    the height of their jumps. By giving up a bit of health (due to the explosion),
    they were able to jump much higher and reach better strategic positions. None
    of the designers probably implemented the rocket launcher knockback effect with
    this in mind. Nonetheless, players have been using this technique to their advantage

- en: Of course, this emergent mechanic exists only because Quake had a deep enough
    system for it to emerge. The Rocket Launcher was a unique weapon to use in particular
    situations and unlike the others had a knockback effect with every shot. Gaining
    a good shooting position was an important part of the strategy for winning a game.
    Jumping was an important factor as well, useful for moving faster and in a nonlinear
    way. All of this prepared the ground for the emergence of a new way to use the
    weapon.
  id: totrans-236

  zh: 当然，这种涌现机制之所以存在，仅仅是因为《雷神之锤》有一个足够深度的系统，使其得以涌现。火箭发射器是在特定情况下使用的独特武器，与其他武器不同，每次射击都有击退效果。获得良好的射击位置是赢得游戏策略的重要组成部分。跳跃也是一个重要因素，有助于更快地以非线性方式移动。所有这些都为使用武器的新的使用方式奠定了基础。
- en: 'So, ultimately, depth can be achieved by giving the player different tools
    to solve problems (or fight her enemies) in different ways. Be warned, though:
    giving different tools means that even if one might be the best in a specific

    something is clearly and always better than everything else. For some players

    talking here of objectively better game elements, not favored ones. There is a
    huge difference and, in fact, players will most likely stick to their favorite
    options, but since they won't be optimal strategies, their preference will be
    constantly challenged by the game. Sometimes difficulty might ramp up just because
    they deliberately choose to go for their favorite tools, instead of the best ones.
    Sometimes they could be surprised by how heavily the gameplay might change, just
    by switching weapon, character, or strategy. This is all great news. Good games
    empower players to choose their own tools and let them embrace the consequences

  zh: 节奏：游戏的节奏是其复杂性的一个重要因素。玩家必须做出的决策数量（这看起来像是深度）需要与其做出决策的时间合理平衡。时间太少，玩家的头脑就无法一次性处理所有信息，导致复杂性破坏深度。这在玩家被要求做出无知的决策，关于她实际上并不了解或理解的事情的决策尤其如此。一个经典的例子是RPG游戏中的角色创建。决定角色的职业和能力将对整个游戏产生深远的影响，因此请小心考虑玩家在创建角色时需要做出的选择数量，以及其中有多少是决定游戏剩余部分的决定性因素。

- en: In the early days of video games, there was a physical instruction manual that
    players had to read in order to understand how to play a game. Most of them, of
    course, never bothered and just jumped into the gameplay figuring out that by
    themselves. That has been the standard for years.

    more affordable and mainstream technology, the average video gamer is today pretty
    much anyone. It is therefore impossible to take for granted that he''d be able
    to learn a game just by immersing himself in it. On the other hand, video games
    themselves have become quite complex systems. Learning a game such as Doom back
    in 1993 was a straightforward task: arrows keys to move, Ctrl to fire, Spacebar
    to use objects. With those controls in mind, all you have to do in the game is
    to shoot at the monsters and open some doors by activating switches or collecting
    keys.'

- en: Just telling players how something works is never enough. Imagine a tutorial
    on how to use a shield in Dark Souls without having any shields. The tutorial
    message “Press Left Ctrl to parry” would be pretty meaningless, since with no
    shield equipped, by pressing Left Ctrl nothing would really happen. So even if
    the player knows which key he needs to press to use a shield, chances are that
    when he eventually comes across one, he wouldn’t remember how to use it.

    of captioned images are presented to the player explaining how to perform the
    new mechanic. What is great about the Far Cry tutorials is that those tutorial

- en: Explaining what a mechanic is in a context where the player can try it out and
    experiment with it in a safe way means the player will truly learn it before moving
