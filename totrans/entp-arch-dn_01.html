<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">The Sad State of Information Systems</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Before jumping to solutions, it is essential to share a thorough diagnostic of a situation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">In the case of information systems and, more generally, computer use, any user knows of the term “bug” and has experienced the frustration associated with malfunction, sometimes with a high personal impact (loss of personal data, consequences regarding revenue, and so on). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">For companies, a malfunction in IT can have harsh consequences since they depend more and more on computers to realize their business operations, hence their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">financial objectives.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">After defining what an information system is and explaining how its efficiency (or lack thereof) can be calculated, an attempt at classifying the causes of such problems will be exposed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">As for solutions, this will be the subject of the rest of this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">But for now, we must understand what is going wrong with information systems, how this happens, and – more importantly – </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">why.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">In this chapter, we will cover the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">main topics:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">What is an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">information system?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Why is software building still a craftsmanship, with good and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">bad consequences?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">How the efficiency of an information system can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">be evaluated</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">How to classify the different impacts that can happen on information systems, as well as what their causes and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">consequences are</span></span></li>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">What is an information system?</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Before talking</span><a id="_idIndexMarker000"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1"> about the state of information systems, it might be useful to give a clear definition of what an information system is and even what a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">system is.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">A </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1"> is a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">group of items that operate together to reach a common goal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">This is the basic difference between a system and a union of individualities: the parts of a system work together toward </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">a vision.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">An </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">information system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1"> (we will sometimes abbreviate it as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">IS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">) furthers this definition as a group of items that share information to reach a common objective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Strictly speaking, an IS is not necessarily made of software, even though most of what we will talk about in this book is about computerized information systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">And, even in the most sophisticated IS, there remains a non-neglectable part of information that is not software-contained. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.4">This is a situation that we will talk about, but for the main part of this book, we will put ourselves in the hypothesis of software-based information systems as they are now pervasive in almost every company </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">and organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">So, an IS is understood as a set of software tools that operate toward a goal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">This goal is typically designed as a business process for most of the companies that own the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.3">It should be noted that software always depends on hardware, but this tends to be more and more hidden in the background and the IS is more and more considered as the software means, organized together to reach a business goal, by implementing functional </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">processes efficiently.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">A quick history of information systems</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">When dealing with </span><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">general subjects, such as the quality of information systems, it is always interesting to have a look at the past and analyze the evolution toward the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">current situation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">If we follow the definition stated previously, information systems only appear when at least two entities collaborate. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">In our hypothesis of software-based information systems, this means at least two computers have been connected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">This means that initial room-sized computers that are operated on-premises should not be considered systems, though they were often called “large systems” (the items that were assembled, in this case, were computation mechanisms, short-life memory, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">long-life memory).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Let’s go forward in time a little bit and talk about IBM’s client-server mainframes: those are the first ones that we can consider as information systems since there were client stations connected to a central computer, with information flowing between them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">The protocol was </span><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">proprietary, which made it easier for IBM to reach the high quality of the service provided by these systems (lots of them are still in operation nowadays). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Since a unique implementation of a protocol was defined by the same team, compatibility, and interoperability were a very light issue. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">This is legacy, but when the system is working and when modernizing it is highly risky, the businesses logically make the choice of not moving anything (this is the first rule in information systems management: if it works, do not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">touch it).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Fast-forward again and we are in the nineties. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">This</span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1"> is the era of </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">personal computers</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">PCs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Though there is a worldwide attempt at keeping compatibility between the machines, anybody using computers at this time who was unable to use a given piece of software, because it did not support the embedded video card, knows this was partly a failure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">Of course, things have greatly improved</span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> since then, with </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Video Electronics Standards Association</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">VESA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">) international standards being created for video cards and screens, such as VGA or VESA, and lots of other norms that make it possible, in the present time, to change components of a PC without breaking down the whole system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Still, the toll on information systems has been quite high: how can we expect networks of machines to work well together when even a single machine’s components are hard to assemble? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">Proprietary formats, different encodings, an almost complete absence of strong data exchange protocols: everything led to a difficult situation, and only high-budget companies could operate complex computerized systems with the help of experts, who would twitch about anything from jumpers on an electronic board to compilers parameters to make the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">system work.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Fortunately, Y2K came with the internet expansion and its radical approach to normalizing the exchanges between computers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Now, every single computer that abided by TCP/IP, HTTP, Unicode, and other internet-born standards could exchange data with another one anywhere in the world, regardless of its hardware and operating system implementation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">This is one of the biggest steps forward in the history of IT and the root definition of what our “modern” information systems </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">are today.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">A few software layers were added to this to make it easy to reuse functions in a system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">It started low, with local reuse of code through routines, then libraries and components. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.3">With the advent of network capacities, this evolved to distributed components, web services, and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">finally </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">service-oriented architecture</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">SOA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">This is also the time when n-tier architectures were put in place, establishing a first layer of responsibility separation</span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1"> inside the software application, between </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">graphical user interface</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">GUI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">) management, the exposition of functional services, the implementation of business rules, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">persistence management.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">The last bit, SOA, has</span><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1"> led many companies to costly failures, and the vast majority of attempts at putting such architectures in place resulted in important financial loss and abandonment of projects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">The technological step was too high to operate smoothly, and lighter alternatives have appeared to remove local difficulties of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">SOA approach:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Standardized message-oriented middleware</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">: To counter the proprietary exchange protocols put forward by large software companies operating on SOA and using it to lock their customers in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">their system</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">The REST approach</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">: To lighten the weight of SOAP/WSDL web services and the weight of all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">associated norms</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Enterprise Service Bus</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">: This technique is used to reduce the importance of the middleware and reach a “dumb pipes” paradigm where the software applications participating in the system would be able to communicate with each other without needing a central piece of software that would necessarily become a single point </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">of failure</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">As the presence of a few reference books (Sassoon, Longépé, and Caseau) show, the best practices to design a strong and evolution-capable IS were already available in the late nineties, though not very well known. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">But it was during the 2000s that these practices came to a larger share in the community and SOA and other service-based approaches flourished, leading to the microservices architecture in the beginning of the 2010s. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">This set of practices is still considered as the reference architecture at the time of writing, though we will see that not all its recommendations should be applied without a strong analysis of its usefulness in the studied context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.4">As we will see, the granularity of services is key to obtaining an efficient IS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.5">But for now, we will talk about software building in general and try to understand the current limits of this </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">so-called “industry.”</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Software building – still craftsmanship</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">precise definition of an information system, as interpreted in this book, has been given together with a brief history of its evolution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">This history is not only very short but shows many recent evolutions, most of them radically different from the previous state of the art. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">This very rapid evolution is a sign that information systems design is not something that can be considered stabilized and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">completely understood.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">There remains a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">large part of craftsmanship in the design and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">deployment of a software information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">Craftsmanship has its advantages: human attention to detail, custom-tailored functions, uniqueness, and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">It also has numerous drawbacks, such as high costs, difficulty in evolving in a controlled way, dependence on a few creators, and many others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.4">These drawbacks outgrow the advantages in modern companies for which the information system has become the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">operational backbone.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Well-crafted information systems are an evolution from arbitrarily evolving ones, and there is nothing to be ashamed of with a craftsman’s job, but the way forward today is toward an industrialized approach to information systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">This is what this book is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">all about.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Craftsmanship as opposed to previous lack of quality</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Craftsmanship</span><a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1"> is used in several domains of IT where opposition is established with older, more arbitrary, and self-organized methods where used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">For example, numerous IT conferences include the word “craftsmanship” in their names as a statement of their will to address quality and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">heterogeneity issues.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">Information systems have long appeared simply because pieces of the system were put together and linked without any reflection on the whole system itself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">This is generally what happens with so-called “point-to-point integrations,” where connections are made between different software modules while considering only the source and the destination of the link, without any map of all the links that exist, sometimes reproducing an already existing link or reversing the initially intended direction of the functional dependency between the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">two modules.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">Such systems that are born without anybody thinking of the whole functioning have very few chances to remain stable for long. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">In the rare cases where only a few connections are created, the system can operate fine, but we all know that IT evolves very quickly, and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">business needs are added all the time (“the only stable thing in a system is its need to evolve”). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">If nobody has a global view of the whole system, there is no way that its overall evolution is going to develop ideally. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">It would be pure chance and Murphy’s Law states that, if something can go wrong in a software system, it most </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">definitely will.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">Software craftsmanship</span><a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1"> involves a will to not let the system create itself and develop in the wrong direction, but to take extra care of the software quality and methods to build time-enduring and evolution-capable systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">When applied to code (where it mostly happens), software craftsmanship includes test automation, a refactoring approach, quality indicators monitoring, and many other methods and techniques that go beyond </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">minimal practices.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">We could argue that these practices are contrary to craftsmanship, but this is only true in established industries, where craftsmanship lives in opposition to standardized industrial production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">In the world of IT, industrialization has not happened yet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.3">The word “craftsmanship” has been used by artisans of IT who pride themselves on analyzing problems and solving them with code more elegantly and sustainably than usual slack in their analysis and in the realization (many of us have seen code without any analysis documentation and a single unit test, and yet that has been sent into production just because “it worked”). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.4">Craftsmanship – as the word is used in the IT movement – could even be said to be the very first step into industrializing the software domain since this is the first resolute action into making code clean and not letting it derive into what is commonly named in the IT jargon as a “big ball </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">of mud.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">It might look like I oppose craftsmanship and industrialization, but one isn’t better than the other: they are simply two phases of the development of a domain – in our case, software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">Personally, after 38 years of programming with the desire to do things cleanly, I consider myself a craftsman; my goal with this book – and the past 15 years of my architect career – is to humbly help make another step so that software gets out of its infancy problems and becomes an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">adult industry.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">As a side note, a subject of discussion among software architects is about our working domain to be able to ever become an industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">I tend to think that the amount of creativity needed to be a good software engineer will make it impossible to fully industrialize software production, but that a lot of things should be industrialized to reach this mature, adult phase, where IT will finally deliver its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">complete value.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">A word about “emerging architecture”</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">concept of emerging architecture is that, in some human constructions (mainly software applications), architecture is not established upfront, but appears gradually with the construction of the object. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">This concept is often used together with Agile methods, where the software construction is iterative and not done in a single succession of phases, such as in the “V-cycle” method. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.3">Instead of a single design/development/test series of steps, Agile software development loops many times over these steps, each time building on the previous cycle to gradually work toward a final vision that may even evolve during </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">the steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">In this case, each step involves the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1"> minimal design activity necessary to realize the cycle, in a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Keep It Simple</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1"> mindset. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">Thus, there is no initial complete vision of the final architecture, which sometimes can be seen as a serious limitation of Agile methods, but is at the same time their force, as they continually adapt. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">There are ways for this to go awry, though, and it mostly happens where participants in the project expect the architecture to emerge naturally. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.4">This confusion is often seen in software developments where no architect is involved and where developers believe individual best practices, goodwill, and craftsmanship will have a quality impact on the outcome. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.5">The reality is that these practices will positively affect the individual results of each Agile step but will not guide the overall architecture in any sound place since there is no </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">long-term direction.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Therefore, it is very important to understand that emerging architecture does exist but necessitates an active engagement in making it happen gradually. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">It naturally happens at the module level, where a single developer carefully refines and refactors the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.3">But to work at the system level, there needs to be the same level </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">of engagement.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">Craftsmanship as opposed to an industrialized approach</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">In the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1"> previous section, we have opposed craftsmanship to lack of quality intention in the code and thus shown how positive craftsmanship can be. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">Here, we will point out its limits when opposed to industrialization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.3">Craftsmanship bears the idea of a highly skilled individual operating carefully, where time spent is of little importance compared </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">to quality.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">Though craftsmanship – in its noble sense of dedication to hand-polished, high-quality work – is worth praise, it also states that the level of maturity of the domain is still low. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">When reaching maturity,</span><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1"> disciplines tend to separate different steps of the work, automate some of them, standardize practices and tools, and overall become more efficient, even</span><a id="_idIndexMarker018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1"> bringing quality to a higher level that cannot be obtained with an individual human approach alone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">Moreover, industrialization normalizes the whole process and makes it possible for anyone following the norms – and not only highly skilled people – to reach this high level </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">of quality.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">This is what has been done in all industries (and this is even why we call them this), and it is the natural evolution human workers try and reach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">In the software field, predictability, quality, and time-to-market are sought-after qualities and an industrial approach is necessary to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">reach them.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">It is essential to point out that there is nothing wrong with a non-industrial approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">Software is not an industry yet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.3">After all, bridges have been built for more than 4,000 years, so it is quite understandable that this has become something of a controlled and well-established way of working. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.4">Software building, on the other hand, has only been there for a few decades and still is in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">its infancy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">But the important information here is that craftsmanship, despite all its advantages, is the step before industrialization, and lots of information systems owners nowadays really crave an IT team that reaches this next step. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">Stakes are huge for some of them, where competitive advantages come mostly from the information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.3">It has been said that “all companies today are software companies” and this stresses once more the importance of the information system and the absolute necessity of reaching higher levels </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">of quality.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">Craftsmanship is often seen as a software development approach where technical debt is maintained at its lowest level possible, sometimes being virtually nonexistent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">A good craftsman developer will take pride in having zero-defect software, 100% coverage via automated tests, with a fully automated integration and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">deployment system.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">The industrialized approach that was opposed to craftsmanship results mostly in an improvement of the overall quality, but also goes beyond in how it de</span><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">als with technical debt. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.2">Where craftsmanship tends to have an individual and binary approach toward technical debt, as opposed to careless development that lets it potentially go unleashed and out of control, the industrialized approach manages technical debt. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.3">The financial metaphor still stands: instead of refusing any debt altogether, a well-thought operator will carefully manage their capital, borrowing if the advantages are indeed higher than </span><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">the costs of the loan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">Co</span><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">mpared to a craftsman, an industrially-oriented developer will be more aware of the importance of time-to-market and assume a controlled level of technical debt if it helps them reach users before their competitors, thus bringing benefits that will partly be affected in reducing the technical </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">debt afterward.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">Comparison</span><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1"> of software and mechanical industries (in most known cases, the automotive industry in particular) is such a habitual position of contenders of both sides that it has been worn out. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.2">Also, comparisons do not necessarily bear logic, depending on the way they are realized. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.3">For example, in the famous </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">Microsoft versus General Motors</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1"> meme, comparing a single car with a single piece of software brings strange conclusions from each side (</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">If the car industry evolved as quickly as software, we would have cars driving 1,000 miles per gallon</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">”/“</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">If car industry worked as the software industry, a car would crash inadvertently every 1,000 miles</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">”). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">The underlying error in this ill comparison is that the level of complexity is not the same on both sides. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.3">If you were to compare a single car created in an industrial factory, the cost should be compared to the single operation of a functional process in an information system, since only one function is individually operated (transporting a few people in the case of a car, calculating a payroll – for example – in</span><a id="_idIndexMarker024"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1"> the case of the software application). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">If we turn the problem the other way around and want to compare the internal operation of the software with its tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of lines of code, the right comparison would be with the car factory itself as it has the necessary modularity to change its car model production, and it also contains thousands of functions and many more moving parts to perform such a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">moving task.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">In short, wrongly-calibrated comparisons can be very misleading and of little practical interest. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">But comparing information systems building to the design of a car factory, for example, is closer to the reality of the complexity of each system and can provide interesting insights, so long as you contextualize them carefully. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">As stated previously, comparing information systems to bridges can be pertinent if we stay on the criteria of the age of the industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.4">How could IT, an activity that is only a few decades old, reach the same level of maturity as an activity that has been developed over </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">several millennia?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">We will stop this comparison for now, but you will be introduced to several comparisons between the software “industry” and more traditional industries that better deserve this qualification throughout this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">We will try to keep the comparison as helpful and legitimate as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.3">Again, there is no judgment in saying that IT is not completely industrialized yet: some systems undoubtedly are, and some are not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.4">And this should not be taken against anyone as industries took many human generations to reach their current level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.5">Software-based information systems simply have not had the time to do so. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.6">This book is about the means to help go in this direction, taking into account experiments from other industries, while keeping in mind that comparisons may sometimes be misleading and should be used while paying attention to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">their applicability.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">Now that we have established what an information system is and the many infancy problems that it may have because the field is not industrialized yet, a sound engineering approach is needed to evaluate this lack </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">of maturity.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">The efficiency of an IS</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">Engineering</span><a id="_idIndexMarker025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1"> is about</span><a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1"> making things in a controlled way; information systems will not escape this much-awaited transition as their efficiency could be improved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">To do so, we need indicators, measures, and a method to get the results on a given information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.3">Fortunately, there is a consensus on this in the field of expertise, as we will </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">see now.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">The measure of efficiency of a system</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">Since a system</span><a id="_idIndexMarker027"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1"> is a group of items working together toward a goal, as defined previously, measuring the efficiency of the whole means more than just knowing the efficiency measures of each item and summing them one way or another. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">It is often said that the value of a good information system is much more than the value of each of its moving parts and that the most positive effects come from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">their interactions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">A good way to measure the efficiency of an information system is to evaluate how much time and money it helps save on the functional processes it supports. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.2">However, this is quite complicated to measure since a single IS generally operates several processes, and their respective importance and costs should be evaluated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.3">If you consider that processes are also partly human-operated and that the gain of efficiency does not come only from the software part but from the way the functional teams use the application, how they have been trained, what investment has been put in the hardware for performance, and so on, it starts getting difficult to evaluate the efficiency of a complete system with these metrics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.4">Furthermore, the output may be closer to a return-on-investment calculation than that of an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">efficiency metric.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">This is why the efficiency of IS is often evaluated through simpler, more attainable metrics, namely the percentage of cost used for maintenance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">This simple ratio allows us to know how much money is put to keep the system working (this is an operational cost) versus how much has been put into designing it and making it better (which is an investment cost). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.3">As functional features are what is asked of the system, the more maintenance there is to keep it operating, the less money is related to getting value out of the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.4">Of course, there are many points of view on software efficiency, and we are going to browse a lot of them together in this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.5">But maintenance is simply the easiest way to start evaluating the state of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">an IS.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">The cost of maintenance</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">Maintenance </span><a id="_idIndexMarker028"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">may be the field where software is still lacking the most. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">Methodologies have arisen on the subject of software design and development that are starting to help turn craftsmanship into a more industrial approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.3">But </span><a id="_idIndexMarker029"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">design and development are just the beginning of the journey for a piece of software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">Once in production, the application has to be deployed, patched (sometimes while functioning), improved, and maintained in the long run. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.3">This is where bad design, technical debt, and high costs of maintenance show the shortcomings of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">design phase.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">Again, the picture is not all that bad. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">After all, there are proven methods to upgrade software applications while running, which is quite an achievement if we compare this to its mechanical counterpart of changing a car’s wheel while running. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.3">But an analysis of the total costs of maintenance of ISs shows that this is only the tip of the iceberg and the general situation is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">quite awry.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">A study from Gartner dated around 10 years ago and based on 3,700 companies indicates that 72% of the budget of IT is used for maintenance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">You read that correctly: almost three-quarters of the cost of an IS is affected not by designing and improving it, but by adjusting and keeping it working while in production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">Again – and with all the care that should be taken with such a comparison – imagine a house that, once you have paid for its building, would cost you three times as much every year just to prevent it from collapsing! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.4">This shows the sad state of information </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">systems today.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">You will find many other studies on this, but the Gartner one may be the most well-known. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">To give just another confirming point of view, another study from the same period showed that “roughly 20% of technology-supported initiatives are failures, and that number increases with the size and complexity of the project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.3">However, unsuccessful projects often show unmistakable symptoms of failure before execution </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">even starts.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">The good news is that we are not condemned to go on this way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">In its infancy, car manufacturing had the same problem, with a huge maintenance cost compared to the initial production toll. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.3">The first cars were not industrialized but hand-built and their yearly maintenance was almost as costly as the car itself, with tires that had to be changed every few thousand kilometers, oil that had to be added so often that dedicated tanks were present in addition to gas ones, and engines had to be revised by mechanics every </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">few months.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">Today, when you look at maintenance metrics in industrialized goods, the situation is magnitudes better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">A brand-new car from a trustworthy company will happily drive tens of thousands of kilometers before its first garage review and, with the improvement of engine </span><a id="_idIndexMarker030"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">manufacturing, adding oil is something of an old story nowadays. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">Another example is oil filters, which are so standardized that two sizes cover almost all of the European market of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">individual cars.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">In factories, where </span><a id="_idIndexMarker031"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">statistics of maintenance are keenly observed because the financial yield highly depends on them, we have numbers available to quantify this in terms of maintenance cost. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">Generally speaking, the costs of a factory are divided into three groups, the ratio of which is important to determine the efficiency of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">the whole:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Fixed expenses</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">: These</span><a id="_idIndexMarker032"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1"> are the expenses that are not correlated with the production volume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">Typically, the cost of the building (through debt reimbursement or lease, depending on whether the company owns or rents the premises) does not depend on how much you produce. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.3">To improve efficiency, you are looking at reducing these costs, but augmenting your production level will also help you because it will reduce their relative impact on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">your revenue.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">Value-adding related expenses</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">: These are the expenses that are directly related</span><a id="_idIndexMarker033"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1"> to your production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.2">The more you produce, the more you will pay your suppliers for the goods they provide you with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.3">You will get more benefits, except if you are selling below the revenue price, which is not only forbidden in most countries but is generally a very bad business decision. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.4">All in all, these expenses are considered good expenses because the higher they are, the more money comes in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">as well!</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">Maintenance expenses</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">: These are expenses that you need to plan for your production </span><a id="_idIndexMarker034"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">tool to continue operating smoothly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.2">Maintenance expenses are a hard beast to tame because, if you neglect them for small economies, they might come back at you and bite strongly (a little economy on cheap lubricating oil and your million-dollar machine may fall apart in a few years). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.3">Maintenance costs have two drawbacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.4">First, contrarily to fixed expenses, maintenance expenses grow with production (the more your machines operate, the more maintenance they need, and this</span><a id="_idIndexMarker035"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1"> continues exponentially as old machines need more maintenance). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.2">Second, the opposite of the second kind of expenses, they do not add visible value to your product: if you include a better engine in the cars you sell, the associated value is immediately perceived; if you buy better oil to maintain the machines that are used to build those engines parts, no customer will ever realize it, let alone pay </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">for it.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">With that, we</span><a id="_idIndexMarker036"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1"> understand why factory managers are very attentive to maintenance costs: they are the “bad” expenses and the difficult ones to manage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.2">Fixed prices need less attention, simply because… well, they are fixed! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.3">And value-adding costs are not such a problem because, when they increase, that means your business is growing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.4">So, maintenance is the key and most factory managers will be judged by the owner or their boss on their maintenance metrics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.5">If you do not control maintenance and the costs are soaring, they will be replaced by another manager. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.6">If they are too restrictive on the maintenance budget, very costly failures may start to appear, and, again, they will be considered responsible for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">the mess.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">Statistics help managers find the right way in this difficult equation by comparing it to what has been done in the past in similar situations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.2">For example, in heavy industry factories, a fair repartition of cost is considered </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">Fixed expenses</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">: 10% of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">the budget</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">Value-added related expenses</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">: 85% of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">the budget</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">Maintenance expenses</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">: 5% of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">the budget</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">There are, of course, tolerated differences in these numbers, but a maintenance ratio higher than 7% has to be justified and, beyond 10%, this is a strong alert regarding the maintenance not being in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">control anymore.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">Now, let’s go back to the Gartner studies, where the admitted average of budget used to “keep the lights on” by the 3,700 IT leaders interrogated was 72%. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">Again, the comparison seems negative to the so-called IT industry: 10 times worse! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.3">But there are a few circumstances that must be considered. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.4">First, the natural and optimal sharing of costs in IT is necessarily different since the design is only made in the mind and does not need expensive material prototypes like in the heavy industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.5">Also, the fixed costs share is becoming lower and lower due to the availability of “as a service” artifacts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.6">When, a few decades ago, buying a huge computer had a large toll on the budget, particularly in the first years when it was only partially used, cloud operations allowed us to buy computer power as needed, which made these costs fall into the investment </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">costs group.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">So, we could </span><a id="_idIndexMarker037"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">consider that the numbers are not directly comparable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">Nonetheless, the IT industry has a problem with maintenance costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.3">And as engineers, the question that immediately pops to mind is: Where does this come from? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.4">The next section will hopefully show you that the causes are – most of the time – easy to establish since some generic errors are made when designing information systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.5">These are at the root of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">observed shortcomings.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">The horizontal axis expresses the frequency of finding the pattern in information systems that have been studied. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.2">Admittedly, those were ISs with problems, since consultants like me were hired to work on them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.3">However, a decade of experience on almost 100 organization/industry systems from many different contexts showed that this is – sadly – something extremely current in ISs and that high-quality, rapidly evolving, and cost-efficient ones are extremely scarce. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.4">These are reserved for very small companies with limited needs or very large and rich ones that have known from the beginning that their IT system was their spine and brain and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">invested accordingly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">The vertical</span><a id="_idIndexMarker040"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1"> axis of the schema evaluates the impact the anti-pattern has on the functioning of the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">The higher the position of the anti-pattern, the more it hinders the correct working and/or evolution of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">the IS.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">The consequence of this classification mode is that the anti-pattern at the top right position (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">LEVEL 1</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">) is the most impactful and most often observed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">This case corresponds to when the business processes are directly implemented in the software layer of the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">In </span><a href="B21293_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor069"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">Chapter 3</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">, we will consider the decomposition of IS on four different layers, but for now, suffice it to say that the good alignment between these layers is the most important source of quality and that the four-layer diagram is of such importance that the symbols of the 14 anti-patterns documented are based </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">on it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">The following three anti-patterns, as shown in the top-right corner of the preceding diagram (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">LEVEL 2</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">), are a bit less spread and harmful than the first one but account for a lot of observed difficulties. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">They correspond to the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">three cases:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">Feature with multiple implementations</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">: This leads to different business rules, depending on which software is used, and obvious mistakes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">as consequences</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">Silos</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">: These cause duplication of data and additional work, together with errors due to synchronization or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">lack thereof</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">Monoliths</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">: Heer, a single software application concentrates so many business functions that its evolution is complex and it becomes a bottleneck for the whole system and sometimes even a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">blocking point</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">The remaining 19 anti-patterns (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">LEVEL 3</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">) are less observed and/or less dangerous for the evolution or correct functioning of the information systems, but their knowledge can help us spot them in maps of systems and improve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">the situation.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">This is why it is always better to gradually improve an existing system, leaning on its good behaviors and progressively improving the modules that cause the most trouble </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">for users.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">Depending on the level of quality of an information system, the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">can occur:</span></span></p>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">It can be so full of problems that implementing new features is complicated and necessitates dedicated project management and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">impact analysis</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">It can be in such a state that evolution is almost impossible or at the price of a higher instability of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">whole system</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker045"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">evolution of ISs is often based on phases with a duration of a few years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.2">After 2 to 3 years, and in the best cases 5 years, the future of the business is so difficult to predict that planning the evolution of the underlying IS does not make any sense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.3">In highly volatile activities, even a plan of 2 years may be considered </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">too long.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">Of course, many ISs cannot be fully corrected in only a few years and several plans will be necessary to re-align them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.2">In this case, the approach is the same as in an Agile software development project: a first step – though much longer, generally around a semester – is realized to realign the most urgent problem, at which point objectives are re-analyzed and a following re-alignment step is undertaken, and so on, in a continuous </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">improvement approach.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">Although much more tempting in some cases (and in particular very appealing to non-technical profiles that do not grasp the difficulties linked to stabilization), the Big Bang approach is rarely the solution, and if you have to deal with an inefficient information system, you will most likely have to plan for a step-by-step evolution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.2">While you will be doing such a change in an IS, this will quickly come in handy with legacy modules. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.3">And though the IT industry is quick to consider older technologies as garbage (just type any technology name, followed by “is dead,” into a browser and you will realize the extent of this), a responsible approach to IS evolution is to observe respect toward the legacy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.4">The reason it became legacy is that it has been providing value for a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">long time.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">In this chapter, we discussed what an IS is and why, despite all the expertise and care that can be given by true craftsmanship in software design, the system that links all these applications together can present many issues, mainly in terms of maintenance costs and the ability to evolve in time and rise to the challenges of new business processes and requests for features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.2">Many symptoms can alert us of the state of a given IS but they all boil down to one main reason: IT has not reached the state of a truly industrialized domain since it is still a very recent human activity compared to other </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">actual industries.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">In the next chapter, we will talk about how industrialization principles can be applied to software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.2">This can be summed up in two actions: cutting down complexity and standardizing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">the interfaces.</span></span></p>
