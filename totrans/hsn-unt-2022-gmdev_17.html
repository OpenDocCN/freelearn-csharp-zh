    <h1 id="_idParaDest-209" class="chapterTitle">Creating Animations with Animator, Cinemachine, and Timeline</h1>
    <p class="normal">Sometimes, we need to move objects in a predetermined way, such as with cutscenes, or specific character animations, such as jumping, running, and so on. In this chapter, we will go over several Unity animation systems to create all the possible movements of objects we can get without scripting.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we will examine the following animation concepts: </p>

      <li class="bulletList">Using Skinning Animation with Animator</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Scripting animations</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating dynamic cameras with Cinemachine</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating cutscenes with Timeline</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create cutscenes to tell the history of your game or highlight specific areas of your level, as well as create dynamic cameras that are capable of giving an accurate look to your game, regardless of the situation.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-210" class="heading-1">Using Skinning Animation with Animator</h1>
    <p class="normal">So far, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker1093"/>used what are called static meshes, which <a id="_idIndexMarker1094"/>are solid three-dimensional models that are not supposed <a id="_idIndexMarker1095"/>to bend or animate in any way (aside from moving separately, like the doors of a car). </p>
    <p class="normal">We also have another kind of mesh, called skinned meshes, which <a id="_idIndexMarker1096"/>are meshes that have the ability to bend based on a skeleton, so they can emulate the muscle movements of the human body. We are going to explore how to integrate animated humanoid characters into our project to create enemy and player movements.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will examine the following skeletal mesh concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Understanding skinning</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Importing skinned meshes</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Integration using Animator Controllers</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Using Avatar Masks</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">We are <a id="_idIndexMarker1097"/>going to explore the concept of skinning and <a id="_idIndexMarker1098"/>how it allows you to animate characters. Then, we are going to bring animated meshes into our project to finally apply animations to them. Let’s start by discussing how to bring skeletal animations into our project.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-211" class="heading-2">Understanding skinning</h2>
    <p class="normal">In order to get an animated mesh, we need to have four pieces, starting with the mesh that will <a id="_idIndexMarker1099"/>be animated, which is created the same way as any other mesh. Then, we need the skeleton, which is a set of bones that will match the desired mesh topology, such as the arms, fingers, feet, and so on. In <em class="italic">Figure 17.1</em>, you can see an example of a set of bones aligned with our target mesh: </p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.1: A ninja mesh with a skeleton matching its default pose</p>
    <p class="normal">Once the artist has created the model and its bones, the next step is to do skinning, which is the act of associating every vertex of the model to one or more bones. This way, when you move a bone, the associated vertices will move with it. In <em class="italic">Figure 17.2</em>, you can see the triangles of a mesh being painted according to the color of the bone that affects it as a way to visualize the influence of the bones. You will notice blending between colors, meaning that those vertexes are affected differently by different bones to allow the <a id="_idIndexMarker1100"/>vertexes near an articulation to bend nicely. Also, <em class="italic">Figure 17.2 </em>illustrates an example of a two-dimensional mesh used for two-dimensional games, but the concept is the same:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.2: Mesh skinning weights visually represented as colors</p>
    <p class="normal">Finally, the last piece you need is the actual animation, which will simply consist of a blending of different poses of the mesh bones. The artist will create keyframes in an animation, determining which pose the model needs to have at different moments, and then the animation system will simply interpolate between them. Basically, the artist will animate the bones, and the skinning system will apply this animation to the whole mesh.</p>
    <p class="normal">In order to get the four parts, we need to get the proper assets containing them. The usual format <a id="_idIndexMarker1101"/>in this scenario is <strong class="keyWord">Filmbox</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">FBX</strong>), which we used previously to import 3D models. This format can contain every piece we need—the model, the skeleton with the skinning, and the animations—but usually those pieces will come split into several files to be re-utilized. </p>
    <p class="normal">Imagine a city simulator game where we have several citizen meshes with different aspects and all of them must be animated. If we have a single FBX per citizen containing the mesh, the skinning, and the animation, it will cause each model to have its own animation, or at least a clone of the same one, repeating them. When we need to change that animation, we will need to update all the mesh citizens, which is a time-consuming process. Instead of this, we can have one FBX per citizen, containing the mesh and the <a id="_idIndexMarker1102"/>bones with the proper skinning based on that mesh, as well as a separate FBX for each animation, containing the same bones that all the citizens have with the proper animation, but without the mesh. This will allow us to mix and match the citizen FBX with the animation’s FBX files. You may be wondering why both the model FBX and the animation FBX must have the mesh. This is because they need to match in order to make both files compatible. In <em class="italic">Figure 17.3</em>, you can see how the files should look:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.3: The animation and model FBX files of the package we will use in our project</p>
    <p class="normal">Also, it is worth mentioning a concept called retargeting. As we said before, in order to mix a model and an animation file, we need them to have the same bone structure, which means the same number of bones, hierarchy, and names.</p>
    <p class="normal">Sometimes, this is not possible, especially when we mix custom models created by our artist with external animation files that you can record from an actor using motion-capture techniques, or just by buying a mocap (motion-capture) library, a set of animations captured on real humans using specific mocap hardware. In such cases, it is highly likely that you will encounter different bone structures between the one in the mocap library and your character model, so here is where retargeting kicks in. This technique allows Unity to create a generic mapping between two different humanoid-only bone structures to make them compatible. In the next section, <em class="italic">Importing skeletal animations</em>, we will see how to enable this feature.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we understand the basics behind skinned meshes, let’s see how we can get the model’s assets with bones and animations.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-212" class="heading-2">Importing skeletal animations</h2>
    <p class="normal">We can download a character model by searching for it in the Asset Store, under the <strong class="screenText">3D</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Characters</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Humanoids</strong> section. You can also use external sites, such as the website called Mixamo, to download them. Note that sometimes you will need to download several packages <a id="_idIndexMarker1103"/>because sometimes packages come only with the skinned model, and others with animation only. Luckily the one we downloaded already contains the skinned meshes and the animations. </p>
    <p class="normal">In my package content, I can find the animation’s FBX files in the <code class="inlineCode">Animations</code> folder and the FBX file of my model called <code class="inlineCode">Polyart_Mesh</code> in the <code class="inlineCode">Mesh</code> folder. Remember that sometimes you won’t have them separated like this, and the animations may be located in the same FBX as the model, if any animations are present at all. Now that we have the required files, let’s discuss how to properly configure them.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start selecting the <strong class="screenText">Model</strong> file and checking the <strong class="screenText">Rig</strong> tab. Within this tab, you will find a setting called <strong class="screenText">Animation Type</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.4</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_04.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.4: The Rig properties</p>
    <p class="normal">This property contains the following options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">None</strong>: Mode for non-animated models; every static mesh in your game will use this mode.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Legacy</strong>: The mode to be used in old Unity Projects and models; do not use this in new projects.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Generic</strong>: A new animation system that can be used in all kinds of models but is commonly used in non-humanoid models, such as horses, octopuses, and so on. If you use this mode, both the model and animation FBX files must have the exact same bone names and structure, thereby reducing the possibility of combining animation from external sources.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Humanoid</strong>: New animation systems designed to be used in humanoid models. It enables features such <a id="_idIndexMarker1104"/>as retargeting and <strong class="keyWord">Inverse Kinematics</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IK</strong>). This allows you to combine models with different bones than the animation because Unity will create a mapping between those structures and a generic one, called the avatar. Take into account that sometimes the automatic mapping can fail, and you will need to correct it manually; so, if your generic model has everything you need, I recommend you stick to <strong class="keyWord">Generic</strong> if that’s the default configuration of the FBX.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">In my case, the FBX files in my package have the modes set to <strong class="screenText">Humanoid</strong>, so that’s good, but remember, only switch to other modes if it is absolutely necessary (for example, if you <a id="_idIndexMarker1105"/>need to combine different models and animations). Now that we have discussed the <strong class="screenText">Rig</strong> settings, let’s talk about the <strong class="screenText">Animation</strong> settings.</p>
    <p class="normal">In order to do this, select any animation FBX file and look for the <strong class="screenText">Animation</strong> tab in the Inspector window. You will find several settings, such as the <strong class="screenText">Import Animation</strong> checkbox, which must be marked if the file has an animation (not the model files), and the <strong class="screenText">Clips</strong> list, where you will find all the animations in the file. In the following screenshot, you can see the <strong class="screenText">Clips</strong> list for one of our animation files:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_05.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.5: A Clips list in the Animation settings</p>
    <p class="normal">An FBX file with animations usually contains a single large animation track, which can contain one or several animations. Either way, by default, Unity will create a single animation based on that track, but if that track contains several animations, you will need to split them manually. In our case, our FBX contains a single animation, but in order to learn how to split it in other cases, do the following:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">From the <strong class="screenText">Clips</strong> list, select any animation that you want to recreate; in my case, I will choose <code class="inlineCode">Run_guard_AR</code>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Take a look at the <strong class="screenText">Start</strong> and <strong class="screenText">End</strong> values below the animation timeline and remember them; we will use them to recreate this clip:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_06.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.6: The clip settings</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="3">Use the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> button to create a new clip and select it.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Rename it to something similar to the original using the input field that currently <a id="_idIndexMarker1106"/>says something like <code class="inlineCode">Take 001</code>. In my case, I will name it <code class="inlineCode">Run</code>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Set the <strong class="screenText">End</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Start</strong> properties with the values we needed to remember in <em class="italic">step 2</em>. In my case, I have <code class="inlineCode">20</code> for <strong class="screenText">End</strong> and <code class="inlineCode">0</code> for <strong class="screenText">Start</strong>. This information usually comes from the artist that made the animation, but you can just try the number that works best or simply drag the blue markers in the timeline on top of these properties. </li>
      <li class="numberedList">If an animation needs to loop, check the <strong class="screenText">Loop Time</strong> checkbox to guarantee that. This will make the animation repeat constantly, which is required in most animations like <strong class="screenText">Walk</strong> or <strong class="screenText">Run</strong>. If not, the animation will play once and never repeat:</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.7: Looping the animation</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="7">Preview the clip by clicking on the bar titled for your animation (<strong class="screenText">Run</strong>, in my case) at the very bottom of the Inspector window and click on the <strong class="screenText">Play</strong> button. You can see the default Unity model in some cases, but you can see your own by dragging the model file to the preview window because it is important to check whether our models are properly configured. If the animation does not play, you will <a id="_idIndexMarker1107"/>need to check whether the <strong class="screenText">Animation Type</strong> setting matches the animation file:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.9: Generated animation clips </p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="9">Remember that <a id="_idIndexMarker1108"/>there are plenty of other settings aside from the <strong class="screenText">Init</strong> frame, <strong class="screenText">End</strong> frame, and <strong class="screenText">Loop Time</strong>. The character I downloaded required other settings like <strong class="screenText">Root Transform Rotation</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Root Transform Position</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Mask</strong> to make it work, and the mileage may vary between character packages. If you are recreating an existing animation, consider copying all settings as they were, or just use the default one. These mentioned settings are beyond the scope of the book, but you can always consult them in the Unity documentation at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AnimationClip.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AnimationClip.html</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have covered the basic configuration, let’s learn how to integrate animations.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-213" class="heading-2">Integration using Animation Controllers</h2>
    <p class="normal">When adding <a id="_idIndexMarker1109"/>animations to our characters, we need to think about the flow of the animations, which means thinking about which animations must be played, when each animation must be active, and how transitions between animations should happen. In previous Unity versions, you needed to code that manually, generating complicated scripts of C# code to handle complex scenarios; but now, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1110"/>have <strong class="keyWord">Animation Controllers</strong>. </p>
    <p class="normal">Animation Controllers are a state machine-based asset where we can diagram the transition logic between animations with a visual <a id="_idIndexMarker1111"/>editor called <strong class="keyWord">Animator</strong>. The idea is that each animation is a state and our model will have several of them. Only one state can be active at a time, so we need to create transitions in order to change them, which will have conditions that must be met in order to trigger the transition process. Conditions are comparisons of data about the character to be animated, such as its velocity, whether it’s shooting or crouched, and so on. </p>
    <p class="normal">So, basically, an Animation Controller or state machine is a set of animations with transition rules <a id="_idIndexMarker1112"/>that will dictate which animation should be active. Let’s start creating a simple Animation Controller by doing the following:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Click the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> button under the <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> view, click on <strong class="screenText">Animator Controller</strong>, and call it <code class="inlineCode">Player</code>. Remember to locate your asset within a folder for proper organization; I will call mine <code class="inlineCode">Animations</code>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Double-click on the asset to open the <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong> window. Don’t confuse this window with the <strong class="screenText">Animation</strong> window; the <strong class="screenText">Animation</strong> window serves to create new Animations, but for now, we will stick with the downloaded ones.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Search for the <strong class="screenText">Idle</strong> animation clip of your character in the <strong class="screenText">Animations</strong> folder of your characters package and drag it into the <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong> window. In my case it was called <strong class="screenText">Idle_guard_ar</strong>. Remember to drag the sub-asset, not the entire file. This will create a box in the Controller representing the animation that will be connected to the entry point of the Controller, indicating that the animation will be the default one because it is the first one that we dragged. If you don’t have an <strong class="screenText">Idle</strong> animation, I encourage you to download one from the Asset Store, maybe searching in other characters’ packages. We will need at least one <strong class="screenText">Idle</strong> and one <strong class="screenText">walking</strong>/<strong class="screenText">running</strong> animation clip:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_10.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.10: Dragging an animation clip from an FBX asset into an Animator Controller</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="4">Drag the <a id="_idIndexMarker1113"/>running animation in the same way, which is <strong class="screenText">Run_guard_AR</strong> in my case.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Right-click on the <strong class="screenText">Idle</strong> animation box in the <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong> window, select <strong class="screenText">Make Transition</strong>, and left-click on the <strong class="screenText">Run</strong> animation. This will create a transition between <strong class="screenText">Idle</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Run</strong>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Create another transition from <strong class="screenText">Run</strong> to <strong class="screenText">Idle</strong> in the same way:</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.11: Transitions between two animations</p>
    <p class="normal">Transitions must have conditions in order to prevent animations from swapping constantly, but in order to create conditions, we need data to make comparisons. We will add properties to our Controller, which will represent data used by the transitions. Later, in the <em class="italic">Scripting Animations</em> section of this chapter, we will set that data to match the current state of our object. But for now, let’s create the data and test how the Controller reacts to different values. In order to create conditions based on properties, do the following:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Parameters</strong> tab in the top-left part of the <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong> window. If you don’t see it, click on the button that looks like an eye crossed by a line to display the tabs. The icon will change to an uncrossed eye.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> button and select <strong class="screenText">Float</strong> to create a number that will represent the velocity of our character, naming it <code class="inlineCode">Velocity</code>. If you missed the renaming part, just left-click on the variable and rename it:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_12.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.12: The Parameters tab with a float Velocity property</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="3">Click on the <strong class="screenText"><a id="_idIndexMarker1114"/></strong><strong class="screenText">Idle to Run</strong> transition (the white line with an arrow in the middle) and look at the Conditions property in the Inspector window.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> button at the bottom of the list, which will create a condition that will rule the transition. The default setting will take the first parameter of our animator (in this case, it is <strong class="screenText">Velocity</strong>) and will set the default comparer, in this case, <strong class="keyWord">Greater</strong>, to a value of <code class="inlineCode">0</code>. This tells us that the transition will execute from <strong class="screenText">Idle</strong> to <strong class="screenText">Run</strong> if <strong class="screenText">Idle</strong> is the current animation and the velocity of the Player is greater than <code class="inlineCode">0</code>. I recommend you set a slightly higher value, such as <code class="inlineCode">0.01</code>, to prevent any float rounding errors (a common CPU issue). Also, remember that the actual value of <strong class="screenText">Velocity</strong> needs to be set manually via scripting, which we will do in this chapter’s <em class="italic">Scripting animations</em> section:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_13.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.13: Condition to check whether the velocity is greater than 0.01</p>

      <li class="numberedList" value="5">Do the same to the <strong class="screenText">Run</strong> to <strong class="screenText">Idle</strong> transition, but this time, change <strong class="screenText">Greater</strong> to <strong class="screenText">Less</strong> and again set the value to <code class="inlineCode">0.01</code>:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.14: Condition to check whether a value is less than 0.01</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker1115"/>have our first Animator Controller set up, it’s time to apply it to an object. In order to do that, we will need a series of components. First, when we have an animated character, rather than a regular Mesh Renderer, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1116"/>use the <strong class="keyWord">Skinned Mesh Renderer</strong>. If you select your player or enemy characters and view their children, GameObjects, you will see the Skinned Mesh Renderer in one or more of them:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_15.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.15: A Skinned Mesh Renderer component</p>
    <p class="normal">This component will be in charge of applying the bones’ movements to the mesh. If you search the children of the model, you will find some bones; you can try rotating, moving, and scaling them to see the effect, as shown in the following screenshot. Bear in mind that your bone hierarchy might be different from mine if you downloaded another package from the Asset Store:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_16.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.16: Rotating the neckbone </p>
    <p class="normal">The other component that we need is <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong>, which is automatically added to the skinned meshes at its root GameObject. This component will be in charge of applying the state <a id="_idIndexMarker1117"/>machine that we created in the Animator Controller if the animation FBX files are properly configured, as we mentioned earlier. In order to apply the Animator Controller, do the following:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the player in the <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong> and locate the <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong> component in the root GameObject.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the circle to the right of the <strong class="screenText">Controller</strong> property and select the <strong class="screenText">Player</strong> controller we created earlier. You can also just drag it from the <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> window.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Make sure that the <strong class="screenText">Avatar</strong> property is set to the avatar inside the FBX model of the character (<code class="inlineCode">Polyart_Mesh</code> being the FBX model in our example project); this will tell the animator that we will use that skeleton. You can identify the avatar asset by its icon of a person, as shown in the following screenshot. Usually, this property is correctly set automatically when you drag the FBX model to the scene:</li>

      <li class="numberedList" value="4">Without stopping the game, open the Animator Controller asset again by double-clicking it and selecting the character in the <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong> pane.

      <li class="numberedList" value="6">Depending on how the <strong class="screenText">Run</strong> animation was set, your character might start to move instead of executing the animation in place. This is caused by root motion, a feature that will move the character based on the animation movement. Sometimes, this is useful, but due to the fact that we will fully move our character using scripting, we want that feature to be turned off. You can do that by unchecking the <strong class="screenText">Apply Root Motion</strong> checkbox in the <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong> component of the <strong class="screenText">Character</strong> object, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 17.17</em>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">You will also notice a delay between changing the Velocity value and the start of the animation transition. That’s because, by default, Unity will wait for the original animation to end before executing a transition, but in this scenario, we don’t want that. We need the transition to start immediately. In order to do this, select each transition of the Controller, and in the Inspector window, uncheck the <strong class="screenText">Has Exit Time</strong> checkbox. When this property is checked, a hidden condition for <a id="_idIndexMarker1119"/>the transition to execute is waiting for the animation to end. But with this unchecked, the transition can execute at any moment during the animation, which we want, given that we don’t want any delay between the player being idle and running:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.20: Disabling the Has Exit Time checkbox to execute the transition immediately</p>
    <p class="normal">You can start dragging other animations into the Controller and create complex animation logic, such as adding jump, fall, or crouched animations. I invite you to try other parameter types, such as a Boolean, that use checkboxes instead of numbers. Also, as you develop your game further, your Controller will grow in its number of animations. To manage that, there are other features worth researching, such as <strong class="screenText">Blend Trees</strong> and sub-state machines, but that’s beyond the scope of this book. </p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we learned how to integrate animation clips into our character through Animator Controllers. We added all needed animations and created the necessary transitions between them to react to the game circumstances, like the character velocity changes. </p>
    <p class="normal">Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker1120"/>we have integrated the idle and run animations, let’s integrate the shoot animation, which requires us to use <strong class="keyWord">Avatar Masks</strong>.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-214" class="heading-2">Using Avatar Masks</h2>
    <p class="normal">At first, this case seems as simple as dragging a shoot animation and making transitions <a id="_idIndexMarker1121"/>that use the <code class="inlineCode">Shooting</code> Boolean parameter as a condition. Consider, however, that we can shoot while walking and while running, so that leads to two shooting animations, <strong class="screenText">Walking Shooting</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Idle Shooting</strong>. If you follow this logic, you can think of shooting while falling, jumping, etc., which leads to a greater number of animation combinations. Imagine having different shooting animations for different weapons! Luckily, we have a better solution: a way to combine several animations, using Avatar Masks.</p>
    <p class="normal">The animations state machine we created in the Animator Controller is what is called a <strong class="keyWord">layer</strong>, and an <a id="_idIndexMarker1122"/>Animator Controller can have several layers. This means that we can have more than one state machine in an Animator Controller. There are several reasons to use this, but the common one is to combine layers with Avatar Masks, an asset that allows us to make a specific Animator Controller layer or state machine to affect certain bones, so we can set different state machines for different parts of the body.</p>
    <p class="normal">We can use this to solve the shooting scenario we discussed previously, splitting our player animation logic into two parts, the upper part of the body, and the lower part. The idea is that the lower part will switch between idle and running animations, while the upper part can switch between idle, running, and shooting. This allows us to have scenarios where the lower part is running while the upper part is shooting, or the lower part is idle and the upper part also, or any combination we can imagine. </p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by creating the second layer by doing the following:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Download a shooting animation from the internet or the Asset Store if you don’t have one already. In our case we already have several shooting animations, and we are going to pick the one called <code class="inlineCode">Idle_Shoot_ar</code>.</li>

    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="7">Click again on the wheel and observe how the <strong class="screenText">Blending</strong> parameter is set to <strong class="screenText">Override</strong>, meaning that the bones that this layer affects (driven by the Avatar Mask) will override whatever animation the base layer has—the base layer, in this case, being <strong class="screenText">LowerBody</strong>. That’s how this layer takes ownership of the upper part of the body.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Test this again, changing the values of the parameters while in <strong class="screenText">Play</strong> mode. For example, try checking <strong class="screenText">Shooting</strong> and then set <strong class="screenText">Velocity</strong> to <code class="inlineCode">1</code>, and then to <code class="inlineCode">0</code>, to finally uncheck <strong class="screenText">Shooting</strong>, and see how the transitions execute.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">You might notice that our character might not be pointing in the right direction when shooting. This is because the orientation of the character is modified for this <strong class="screenText">Shoot</strong> animation compared to <strong class="screenText">Idle</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Run</strong>, but the <strong class="screenText">Base Layer</strong> still has ownership of that. We can make the <strong class="screenText">UpperBodyMask</strong> control the orientation by clicking the <a id="_idIndexMarker1126"/>circle at the bottom of the human figure in the <strong class="screenText">Humanoid</strong> section of the Avatar Mask until it becomes green:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.27: Giving the mask authority over the player orientation</p>
    <p class="normal">The issue here is that you will now see the character moving the feet sideways when running and shooting. There’s no easy solution here other than to modify the original animations. In this case, this character has Idle, Idle Shooting, Run and Run Shooting animations, so it clearly has been created without having Avatar Masks in mind, instead just having all possible animation combinations. An alternative is to find another package that works better with Avatar Masks. For learning purposes, we will stick with this, but note that Avatar Masks are not a must; you might be good to go just using all possible animation permutations in a single Animator Controller state machine with all the needed transitions.</p>
    <p class="normal">Another issue you might notice when firing when the Shoot animation is playing is that the muzzle effect will stay in the original position of the weapon. Since the weapon mesh is affected by the skinning animation but not its Transform position, the muzzle cannot follow it. In order to solve this, you can reparent the Muzzle Effect to one of the bones of the weapons—in this case, the GameObject called Trigger_Right, one of the children of the Hips GameObject. Not all animations will have bones for the weapons, so this is one of the possible scenarios you could face: </p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.28: Reparenting the Muzzle Effect to one of the weapon’s bones</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="10">Remember to <a id="_idIndexMarker1127"/>apply the same changes we made to our player to the enemy, which means adding and setting the Player Animator Controller to its <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong> component and changing the <code class="inlineCode">Muzzle effect</code> parent.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have a fully functional Animator Controller, let’s make it reflect the player movement through scripting.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-215" class="heading-1">Scripting animations</h1>
    <p class="normal">With our player’s Animator ready, it is time to do some scripting to make these parameters <a id="_idIndexMarker1128"/>be affected by the actual behavior of the player and match the player’s. In this section we will do the following to achieve this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Script shooting animations</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Script movement animations</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start making our characters execute the <strong class="screenText">Shoot</strong> animation when necessary.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-216" class="heading-2">Scripting player shooting animations</h2>
    <p class="normal">So far, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1129"/>have created a behavior <a id="_idIndexMarker1130"/>to shoot each time we press a key, but the animation is prepared for sustained fire. We can make our <code class="inlineCode">PlayerShooting</code> script shoot a bullet every X number of seconds while we keep the <strong class="screenText">Fire</strong> key pressed to match the animation, instead of having to press the key repeatedly. </p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s see how to do this:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">PlayerShooting</strong> script, add a public float field called <strong class="screenText">fireRate</strong>, which will measure the seconds between bullet spawns. Remember to set this value in the <strong class="screenText">Inspector</strong> of the player.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Change the <strong class="screenText">OnFire</strong> method to the code seen in <em class="italic">Figure 17.29</em>. The idea is to start a repeating action when we press the key and stop it when we release the key. We are using <strong class="screenText">InvokeRepeating</strong> to repeatedly execute a function called <strong class="screenText">Shoot,</strong> which <a id="_idIndexMarker1131"/>we will be creating <a id="_idIndexMarker1132"/>in the next step. The rate of execution will be controlled by the <strong class="screenText">fireRate</strong> field we created in <em class="italic">step 1</em>:</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.29: OnFire changes needed for sustained fire</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="3">Add the <strong class="screenText">Shoot</strong> method as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 17.30</em> to our <strong class="screenText">PlayerShooting</strong> script. This is essentially the same code we had before in the <strong class="screenText">OnFire</strong> method but separated in a function, so we can execute it several times with the <strong class="screenText">InvokeRepeating</strong> function:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_30.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.30: OnFire changes needed for sustained fire</p>
    <p class="normal">If you <a id="_idIndexMarker1133"/>try these changes now, you will notice the bullets will never stop shooting once we click the <strong class="screenText">Fire</strong> button. Even worse, as we press repeatedly, more and more bullets will be shot. With some <a id="_idIndexMarker1134"/>debugging or educated guessing, you might figure out that the <strong class="screenText">CancelInvoke</strong> method is not being executed. The reason behind this is that the <strong class="screenText">Fire</strong> input mapping is not configured by default to inform us about the release of keys, just when they were pressed. Luckily the solution is pretty simple:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Double-click the <strong class="screenText">SuperShooter</strong> inputs asset, the one we created in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>,<em class="chapterRef"> </em><em class="italic">Implementing Movement and Spawning</em>, that contains all the inputs our game supports.</li>

    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="5">With this we have configured the Input to not only tell us when the key was pressed but also when it was released, making our <strong class="screenText">CancelInvoke</strong> method execute now.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker1135"/>we have our constant <a id="_idIndexMarker1136"/>fire behavior, we can do the following to make the animation reflect this:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Add a reference to Animator using <strong class="screenText">GetComponent</strong> in <strong class="screenText">Awake</strong> and cache it in a field, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 17.32</em>:</li>

    </ol>
    <p class="normal">One thing you will notice is that the bullets are still being shot from the player’s chest because our <strong class="screenText">ShootPoint</strong> GameObject, the one that defines the shooting position, is not positioned <a id="_idIndexMarker1137"/>in front of the weapon. Just <a id="_idIndexMarker1138"/>re-parent the <strong class="screenText">ShootPoint</strong> to the weapon bone (<strong class="screenText">Trigger_Right</strong> in our case) and position it to be in front of the weapon. Remember to make the forward vector (the blue arrow in the <strong class="screenText">Scene</strong> view) point along the weapon:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.34: Adapting the ShootPoint to follow the animation</p>
    <p class="normal">For the Visual Scripting version, in order to make the bullet get shot constantly, you should change the <strong class="screenText">Input</strong> nodes of <strong class="screenText">PlayerShooting</strong> like in <em class="italic">Figure 17.35</em>:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.35: Creating a shoot loop</p>
    <p class="normal">As you <a id="_idIndexMarker1139"/>can see, we used a new node called <strong class="screenText">Timer</strong>. The idea of <strong class="screenText">Timer</strong> is similar to the <strong class="screenText">Wait For Seconds</strong> node we used <a id="_idIndexMarker1140"/>before, because it allows us to delay the execution of one action. One of the main differences is that it allows us to cancel the timer before it executes again, meaning we can start the timer when we press the <strong class="screenText">Fire</strong> key, and stop it when we release it. We did that by connecting the <strong class="screenText">InputSystemEventButton</strong> node that has the <strong class="screenText">OnPressed</strong> mode to the <strong class="screenText">Start</strong> pin of the <strong class="screenText">Timer</strong>, and the one with the <strong class="screenText">OnReleased</strong> mode to the <strong class="screenText">Pause</strong> pin. Also, we created a new variable called <strong class="screenText">fireRate</strong> and connected it to the <strong class="screenText">Duration</strong> pin of the <strong class="screenText">Timer</strong>, so we need to specify how much time the <strong class="screenText">Timer</strong> will wait before instantiating our bullets. See how we connected the <strong class="screenText">Completed</strong> pin of the <strong class="screenText">Timer</strong> to the <strong class="screenText">If</strong> node that checks if we have enough bullets to instantiate; we used to connect to the input node here before.</p>
    <p class="normal">One little missing detail here is that when we press a key, time will pass (<strong class="screenText">fireRate</strong>) and then a bullet will be instantiated, but then nothing else. We need to connect the end of the <strong class="screenText">Bullet</strong> shoot sequence (the <strong class="screenText">AudioSource: Play</strong> node in this case) of nodes again to the <strong class="screenText">Start</strong> pin of the <strong class="screenText">Timer</strong> to create a spawn loop. That loop will be interrupted when we release the key, to prevent it from being executed forever:</p>

    <p class="normal">With this, both our player and enemies have a constant shooting behavior and a <strong class="screenText">Shoot</strong> animation to reflect this. Now let’s handle the movement animations for both.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-217" class="heading-2">Scripting movement animations</h2>
    <p class="normal">For the animator controller’s <strong class="screenText">Velocity</strong> parameter, we can detect the magnitude of the velocity <a id="_idIndexMarker1151"/>vector of <strong class="screenText">Rigidbody</strong>, the velocity in meters <a id="_idIndexMarker1152"/>per second, and set that as the current value. This can be perfectly separated from the <strong class="screenText">PlayerMovement</strong> script, so we can reuse this if necessary, in other scenarios. So, we need to create a script such as the one in the following image, which just connects the <strong class="screenText">Rigidbody</strong> component’s velocity with the animator <strong class="screenText">Velocity</strong> parameter, and adds it to the <strong class="screenText">Player</strong> GameObject:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.44: Setting VelocityAnimator variables</p>
    <p class="normal">And regarding the Visual Scripting version, this is what it would look like:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.45: Setting Velocity Animator variables in Visual Scripting</p>
    <p class="normal">You may <a id="_idIndexMarker1153"/>need to increase the <code class="inlineCode">0.01</code> transitions threshold used <a id="_idIndexMarker1154"/>so far in the conditions of the transitions of the animator controller because <strong class="screenText">Rigidbody</strong> keeps moving after releasing the keys. Using <code class="inlineCode">1</code> worked perfectly for me. Another option would be to increase the drag and the velocity of the player to make the character stop faster. Pick whatever method works best for you. Remember the transitions of both layers (<strong class="screenText">UpperBody</strong> and <strong class="screenText">LowerBody</strong>).</p>
    <p class="normal">Now we can add the movement animations to the enemy. Create and add a script to the Enemy prefab called <strong class="screenText">NavMeshAnimator</strong>, which will take the current velocity of its <strong class="screenText">NavMeshAgent</strong> and will set it to the Animator Controller. This will work similarly to the <strong class="screenText">VelocityAnimator</strong> script but this time checking the velocity of the <strong class="screenText">NavMeshAgent</strong>. We didn’t use <strong class="screenText">VelocityAnimator</strong> here because our AI doesn’t use <strong class="screenText">Rigidbody</strong> to move, so it won’t work: </p>

With that, we have scripted our Player and Enemies animations. We are ready to keep learning about animations using Cinemachine to create cutscene cameras and much more.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-218" class="heading-1">Creating dynamic cameras with Cinemachine</h1>
    <p class="normal">Cameras are a very important subject in video games. They allow the player to see their surroundings <a id="_idIndexMarker1159"/>to make decisions based on <a id="_idIndexMarker1160"/>what they see. The game designer usually defines how it behaves to get the exact gameplay experience they want, and that’s no easy task. A lot of behaviors must be layered to get the exact feeling. Also, for cutscenes, it is important to control the path that the camera will be traversing during it and where the camera is looking to focus the action during those constantly moving scenes.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we will use the <code class="inlineCode">Cinemachine</code> package to create both the dynamic cameras that will follow the player’s movements, which we will code in <em class="italic">Part 3</em>, and also, the cameras to be used during cutscenes.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will examine the following Cinemachine concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating camera behaviors</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating dolly tracks</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by discussing how to create a Cinemachine-controlled camera and configure behaviors in it.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-219" class="heading-2">Creating camera behaviors</h2>
    <p class="normal">Cinemachine is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1161"/>tech library containing a collection of different behaviors that can be used in a camera, which when properly combined can generate all kinds of common camera types in video games, including following the player from behind, first-person cameras, top-down cameras, and so on. In order to use these behaviors, we need to understand the concept of brains and virtual cameras.</p>
    <p class="normal">In Cinemachine, we will only keep one main camera, as we have done so far, and that camera will be controlled by virtual cameras, separated GameObjects that have the aforementioned behaviors. We can have several virtual cameras and swap between them at will, but the active virtual camera will be the only one that will control our main camera. This is useful for switching cameras at different points of the game, such as switching between our player’s third-person camera and a cutscene camera. In order to control the main camera with the virtual cameras, it must have a <strong class="keyWord">Brain</strong> component, which will <a id="_idIndexMarker1162"/>monitor all active virtual cameras and pick the proper position to use them.</p>
    <p class="normal">To start using Cinemachine, first, we need to check if it is installed in the Package Manager, as we did previously with other packages. If you don’t remember how to do this, just do the following:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Go to <strong class="screenText">Window | Package Manager</strong>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Ensure that the <strong class="screenText">Packages</strong> option in the top-left part of the window is set to <strong class="screenText">Unity Registry</strong>:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_48.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.48: The Packages filter mode </p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="3">Wait a moment for the left panel to populate all packages from the servers (the internet is required).</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Look for the <strong class="screenText">Cinemachine</strong> package from the list and select it. At the moment of writing this book the latest available version is 2.8.6, but you can use newer versions if you prefer, always ensuring that the following steps work as expected; if not, you can always install the closest version to ours.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">If you see the <strong class="screenText">Install</strong> button in the bottom-right corner of the screen it means it is not installed. Just click that button.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have it installed, we can start creating a virtual camera to follow the player. So far, we just simply parented the camera to the player for it to follow them, but now we will unparent the camera and let Cinemachine handle it to learn how to use this tool:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">MainCamera</strong> inside the player and unparent it (drag it outside the player) in such a way that it becomes a root object of our scene, having no parent at all.</li>

You can open the <strong class="screenText">Body</strong> options (the arrow to its left), change the <strong class="screenText">Follow Offset</strong> property, and set it to the desired distance you want the camera to have from the target.

    <p class="normal">As you <a id="_idIndexMarker1165"/>can see, using Cinemachine is pretty simple, and in our case, the default settings were mostly enough for the kind of behavior we needed. However, if you explore the other <strong class="screenText">Body</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Aim</strong> modes, you will find that you can create any type of camera for any type of game. We won’t cover the other modes in this book, but I strongly recommend you look at the documentation for Cinemachine to check what the other modes do.

    <p class="normal">As you <a id="_idIndexMarker1166"/>did with Cinemachine, you can find other packages’ documentation in the same way. Now that we have achieved the basic camera behavior that we need, let’s explore how we can use Cinemachine to create a camera for our intro cutscene.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-220" class="heading-2">Creating dolly tracks</h2>
    <p class="normal">When the player starts the level, we want a little cutscene with a pan over our scene and the base <a id="_idIndexMarker1167"/>before entering the battle. This will require the camera to follow a fixed path, and that’s exactly what Cinemachine’s dolly camera does. It creates a path where we can attach a virtual camera so that it will follow it. We can set Cinemachine to move automatically through the track or follow a target to the closest point to the track; in our case, we will use the first option.</p>
    <p class="normal">In order to create a dolly camera, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Let’s start creating the track with a cart, which is a little object that will move along the track, which will be the target to follow the camera.

    <p class="normal">With the <a id="_idIndexMarker1170"/>dolly track properly set, we can create our cutscene using <strong class="keyWord">Timeline</strong> to sequence it. </p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-221" class="heading-1">Creating cutscenes with Timeline</h1>
    <p class="normal">We have our intro camera, but that’s not enough to create a cutscene. A proper cutscene is <a id="_idIndexMarker1171"/>a sequence of actions happening at the exact <a id="_idIndexMarker1172"/>moment that they should happen, coordinating several objects to act as intended. We can have actions such as enabling and disabling objects, switching cameras, playing sounds, moving objects, and so on. To do this, Unity offers <strong class="keyWord">Timeline</strong>, which is a sequencer of actions to coordinate those kinds of cutscenes. We will use <strong class="keyWord">Timeline</strong> to create an intro cutscene for our scene, showing the level before starting the game.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will examine the following Timeline concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating animation clips</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Sequencing our intro cutscene</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">We are going to see how to create our own animation clips in Unity to animate our GameObjects and then place them inside a cutscene to coordinate their activation, using the Timeline sequencer tool. Let’s start by creating a camera animation to use later in Timeline.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-222" class="heading-2">Creating animation clips</h2>
    <p class="normal">This is actually not a Timeline-specific feature but rather a Unity feature that works great with Timeline. When we downloaded the character, it came with animation clips that were <a id="_idIndexMarker1173"/>created using external software, but you can create custom animation clips using Unity’s <strong class="screenText">Animation</strong> window. Don’t confuse it with the <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong> window, which allows us to create animation transitions that react to the game situation. This is useful to create small object-specific animations that you will coordinate later in Timeline with other objects’ animations. </p>
    <p class="normal">These animations can control any value of an object’s component properties, such as the positions, colors, and so on. In our case, we want to animate the dolly track’s <strong class="screenText">Position</strong> property to make it go from start to finish in a given time. In order to do this, do the following:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <code class="inlineCode">DollyCart1</code> object.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Open the <strong class="screenText">Animation</strong> (not <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong>) window by going to <strong class="screenText">Window | Animation | Animation</strong>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Create</strong> button at the center of the <strong class="screenText">Animation</strong> window. Remember to do this while the dolly cart (not track) is selected:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_61.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.61: Creating a custom animation clip</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="4">After doing this, you will be prompted to save the animation clip somewhere. I recommend you create an <code class="inlineCode">Animations</code> folder in the project (inside the <code class="inlineCode">Assets</code> folder) and call it <code class="inlineCode">IntroDollyTrack</code>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">If you pay attention, the dolly cart now has an <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong> component with an Animator Controller created, which contains the animation we just created. As with any animation clip, you need <a id="_idIndexMarker1174"/>to apply it to your object with an Animator Controller; custom animations are no exception. So, the <strong class="screenText">Animation</strong> window created them for you.</p>
    <p class="normal">Animating in this window consists of specifying the value of its properties at given moments. In our case, we want Position to have a value of 0 at the beginning of the animation, at 0 seconds on the timeline, and have a value of 254 at the end of the animation, at 5 seconds. I chose 254 because that’s the last possible position in my cart, but that depends on the length of your dolly track. Just test which is the last possible position in yours. Also, I chose <code class="inlineCode">5</code> seconds because that’s what I feel is the correct length for the animation, but feel free to change it as you wish. Now, whatever happens between the animation’s 0 and 5 seconds is an interpolation of the 0 and 254 values, meaning that in 2.5 seconds, the value of Position will be 127. Animating always consists of interpolating different states of our object at different moments.</p>
    <p class="normal">In order to do this, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">Animation</strong> window, click on the record button (the red circle in the top-left section). This will make Unity detect any changes in our object and save them to the animation. Remember to do this while you have selected the dolly cart.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Set the <strong class="screenText">Position</strong> setting of the dolly cart to <code class="inlineCode">1</code> and then <code class="inlineCode">0</code>. Changing this to any value and then to <code class="inlineCode">0</code> again will create a keyframe, which is a point in the animation that says that at <code class="inlineCode">0</code> seconds, we want the <strong class="screenText">Position</strong> value to be <code class="inlineCode">0</code>. We need to set it first to any other value if the value is already at <code class="inlineCode">0</code>. </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="numberedList">You will notice that the <strong class="screenText">Position</strong> property has been added to the animation:</p>

      <li class="numberedList">Set the <strong class="screenText">Position</strong> value of the dolly track to the highest value you can get; in my case, this is <code class="inlineCode">240</code>.

In this scenario, the idea is to give control of the cutscene to the cutscene system, Timeline, because <a id="_idIndexMarker1176"/>this animation won’t be the only thing that needs to be sequenced in our cutscene. One way to prevent the <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong> component from automatically playing the animation we created is to create an empty animation state in the Controller and set it as the default state by following these steps:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Search the Animator Controller that we created at the same time as the animation and open it. If you can’t find it, just select the dolly cart and double-click on the <strong class="screenText">Controller</strong> property of the <strong class="screenText">Animator</strong> component on our GameObject to open the asset.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Right-click on an empty state in the Controller and select <strong class="screenText">Create State</strong> |<strong class="screenText"> Empty</strong>. This will create a new state in the state machine as if we created a new animation, but it is empty this time:</li>

    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="4">Now, if you hit <strong class="screenText">Play</strong>, no animation will play as the default state of our dolly cart is empty. No transition will be required in this case.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker1177"/>have created our camera animation, let’s start creating a cutscene that switches from the intro cutscene camera to the player camera by using Timeline.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-223" class="heading-2">Sequencing our intro cutscene</h2>
    <p class="normal">Timeline is already installed in your project, but if you go to the Package Manager of Timeline, you <a id="_idIndexMarker1178"/>may see an <strong class="screenText">Update</strong> button to get the latest version if you need some of the new features. In our case, we will keep the default version included in our project (1.5.2, at the time of writing this book).</p>
    <p class="normal">The first thing we will do is create a cutscene asset and an object in the scene responsible for playing it. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Create an empty GameObject using the <strong class="screenText">GameObject | Create Empty</strong> option.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Select the empty object and call it <code class="inlineCode">Director</code>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Go to <strong class="screenText">Window | Sequencing | Timeline</strong> to open the <strong class="screenText">Timeline</strong> editor.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click the <strong class="screenText">Create</strong> button in the middle of the <strong class="screenText">Timeline</strong> window while the <strong class="screenText">Director</strong> object is selected to convert that object into the cutscene player (or director).</li>
      <li class="numberedList">After doing this, a window will pop up asking you to save a file. This file will be the cutscene or timeline; each cutscene will be saved in its own file. Save it in a <code class="inlineCode">Cutscenes</code> folder in your project (the <code class="inlineCode">Assets</code> folder).</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Now, you can see that the <strong class="screenText">Director</strong> object has a <strong class="screenText">Playable Director</strong> component with the <strong class="screenText">Intro</strong> cutscene asset saved in the previous step set for the <strong class="screenText">Playable</strong> property, meaning this cutscene will be played by the Director:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_67.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.67: Playable Director prepared to play the Intro Timeline asset </p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have the Timeline asset ready to work with, let’s make it sequence actions. To start, we need to sequence two things—first, the cart position animation we did in the last step and then the camera swap between the dolly track camera (<code class="inlineCode">CM vcam2</code>) and the player cameras (<code class="inlineCode">CM vcam1</code>). As we said before, a cutscene is a sequence of actions executing at given moments, and in order to schedule actions, you will need tracks. In Timeline, we have different kinds of tracks, each one allowing you to execute certain actions on certain objects. We will start with the animation track.</p>
    <p class="normal">The animation track will control which animation a specific object will play; we need one track per <a id="_idIndexMarker1179"/>object to animate. In our case, we want the dolly track to play the <strong class="screenText">Intro</strong> animation that we created, so let’s do that by following these steps:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Add an Animation track by clicking <strong class="screenText">the plus button (+)</strong> and then <strong class="screenText">Animation Track</strong>:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.68: Creating an animation track</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="2">Select the <strong class="screenText">Director</strong> object and check the <strong class="screenText">Bindings</strong> list of the <strong class="screenText">Playable Director</strong> component in the <strong class="screenText">Inspector</strong> window. </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Drag the <strong class="screenText">Cart</strong> object to specify that we want the animation track to control its animation:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.69: Making the animation track control the dolly cart animation in this Director </p>
    <div><p class="normal">Timeline is a generic asset that can be applied to any scene, but as the tracks control specific objects, you need to manually bind them in every scene. In our case, we have an animation track that expects to control a single animator, so in every scene, if we want to apply this cutscene, we need to drag the specific animator to control it in the <strong class="screenText">Bindings</strong> list.</p>
    </div>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="4">Drag the <strong class="screenText">Intro</strong> animation asset that we created to the animation track in the <strong class="screenText">Timeline </strong>window. This will create a clip in the track showing when and for how long the animation will play. You can drag as many animations as possible that the cart can play into the track to sequence different animations at different moments, but right now, we want just that one:</li>

      <li class="numberedList" value="5">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker1180"/>drag the animation to change the exact moment you want it to play. Drag it to the beginning of the track.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Hit the <strong class="screenText">Play</strong> button in the top-left part of the <strong class="screenText">Timeline</strong> window to see it in action. You can also manually drag the white arrow in the <strong class="screenText">Timeline</strong> window to view the cutscene at different moments. If that doesn’t work try playing the game and then stopping:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.71: Playing a timeline and dragging the playback header</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="7">Now, we will make our <strong class="screenText">Intro</strong> timeline asset tell the <code class="inlineCode">CinemachineBrain</code> component (the main camera) which camera will be active during each part of the cutscene, switching to the player camera once the camera animation is over. We will create a second track—a Cinemachine track—which is specialized in making a specific <code class="inlineCode">CinemachineBrain</code> component to switch between different virtual cameras. To do this, follow these steps:</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> button again and click on <strong class="screenText">Cinemachine Track</strong>. Note that you can install <a id="_idIndexMarker1181"/>Timeline without <strong class="screenText">Cinemachine</strong>, but this kind of track won’t show up in that case:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.72: Creating a new Cinemachine track </p>

      <li class="numberedList" value="9">In the <strong class="screenText">Playable Director</strong> component’s <strong class="screenText">Bindings</strong> list, drag the main camera to <strong class="screenText">Cinemachine Track</strong> to make that track control which virtual camera will control the main camera at different moments of the cutscene:</li>

      <li class="numberedList" value="10">The next <a id="_idIndexMarker1182"/>step indicates which virtual camera will be active during specific moments of the timeline. To do so, our Cinemachine track allows us to drag virtual cameras to it, which will create virtual camera clips. Drag both <strong class="screenText">CM vcam2</strong> and <strong class="screenText">CM vcam1</strong>, in that order, to the Cinemachine track:</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.74: Dragging virtual cameras to the Cinemachine track </p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="11">If you hit the <strong class="screenText">Play</strong> button or just drag the <strong class="screenText">Timeline Playback</strong> header, you can see how the active virtual camera changes when the playback header reaches the second virtual camera clip. Remember to view this in the <strong class="screenText">Game</strong> view.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">If you place the mouse near the ends of the clips, a resize cursor will show up. If you drag them, you can resize the clips to specify their duration. In our case, we will need to match the length of the <code class="inlineCode">CM vcam2</code> clip to the <strong class="screenText">Cart</strong> animation clip and then put <code class="inlineCode">CM vcam1</code> at the end of it by dragging it so that the camera will be active when the dolly cart animation ends. In my case, they were already the same length, but just try to change it anyway to practice. Also, you can make the <code class="inlineCode">CM vcam1</code> clip shorter; we just need to play it for a few moments to execute the camera swap.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">You can also overlap the clips a little bit to make a smooth transition between the two cameras, instead of a hard switch, which will look odd:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_75.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.75: Resizing and overlapping clips to interpolate them</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="14">Increase the <strong class="screenText">Start Time</strong> property of the <strong class="screenText">WaveSpawners</strong> to prevent the enemies from being spawned before the cutscene begins.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">If you wait <a id="_idIndexMarker1183"/>for the full cutscene to end, you will notice how at the very end, <code class="inlineCode">CM vcam2</code> becomes active again. You can configure how Timeline will deal with the end of the cutscene, as by default, it does nothing. This can cause different behavior according to the type of track–in our case, again giving control to pick the virtual camera to the <code class="inlineCode">CinemachineBrain</code> component, which will pick the virtual camera with the highest <strong class="screenText">Priority</strong> value. We can change the <strong class="screenText">Priority</strong> property of the virtual cameras to be sure that <strong class="screenText">CM vcam1</strong> (the player camera) is always the more important one, or set <strong class="screenText">Wrap Mode</strong> of the <strong class="screenText">Playable Director</strong> component to <strong class="screenText">Hold</strong>, which will keep everything as the last frame of the timeline specifies. In our case, we will use the latter option to test the Timeline-specific features:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_17_76.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.76: Wrap Mode set to Hold mode</p>
    <p class="normal">Most of the different kinds of tracks work under the same logic; each one will control a specific aspect of a specific object using clips that will execute during a set time. I encourage you to test different tracks to see what they do, such as <strong class="screenText">Activation</strong>, which enables and disables objects during the cutscene. Remember, you can check out the documentation of the Timeline package in the Package Manager.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-224" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we introduced the different animation systems that Unity provides for different requirements. We discussed importing character animations and controlling them with Animation Controllers. We also saw how to make cameras that can react to the game’s current situation, such as the player’s position, or that can be used during cutscenes. Finally, we looked at Timeline and the animation system to create an intro cutscene for our game. These tools are useful for making the animators in our team work directly in Unity without the hassle of integrating external assets (except for character animations) and also preventing the programmer from creating repetitive scripts to create animations, wasting time in the process.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, you are able to import and create animation clips in Unity, as well as apply them to GameObjects to make them move according to the clips. Also, you can place them in the Timeline sequencer to coordinate them and create cutscenes for your game. Finally, you can create dynamic cameras to use in-game or in cutscenes. </p>
    <p class="normal">With this, we end <em class="italic">Part 2</em>, where we learned about different Unity Systems to improve several artistic aspects of our game. In the next chapter, the first chapter of <em class="italic">Part 3</em>, we will wrap up the development of our game, seeing how to build and optimize our game, and also provide a quick intro to augmented reality applications.</p>
