    in Coding C# 8*, we will present some coding best practices to help developers
    program safe, simple, and maintainable software. The chapter also includes tips
    and tricks for coding in C#.

    with Unit Test Cases and TDD*, we will present code testing techniques and principles,
    taking the view that a necessary element of software development is ensuring that
    an application is bug-free and that it satisfies all specifications. Besides that,
    it will present test-driven development, a software development methodology that
    gives unit tests a central role.

    to Write Better Code*, a bunch of the techniques and tools you need to achieve
    well-written code for your project will be presented. The idea here is that, although coding
    can be considered an art, writing understandable code is surely a philosophy,
    and there are tools that can help you with this.
