                    <h1 class="header-title">The Unity Interface</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In <a href="f4fba83f-4f23-4537-a130-ed8dab8f3815.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Downloading and Installing Unity</em>, we explored game engines and took a quick look at four alternative game engines to help us appreciate Unity. We looked at the history of Unity and how it evolved from one release to the next. In addition, we discovered Unity's key capabilities and features. We covered Unity's system requirements for developing Unity games and the system requirements for running them. Finally, we downloaded and installed Unity.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will examine Unity's primary views and windows; we will also cover layouts and the toolbar. The interface components covered in this chapter are the ones used most often. Additional interface components will be covered in subsequent chapters as new functionality and tools are introduced.</p>
<p>Specifically, we will cover the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen Real Estate </li>
<li>Menu</li>
<li>Scene view</li>
<li>Game view</li>
<li>Project window</li>
<li>Hierarchy window</li>
<li>Inspector window</li>
<li>Toolbar</li>
<li>Layouts</li>
</ul>
<p>Unity can be run on Windows PCs and Macs. The screen images used in this chapter and throughout the book are from Unity running on a Mac. There might be slight interface differences between the screenshots provided and you see when Unity is running on a Windows PC.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Screen real estate </h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When we first launch Unity, we might be intimidated by all the areas, tabs, menus, and buttons on the interface. Unity is a complex game engine with a lot of functionality, so we should expect more components for us to interact with. If we break the interface down into separate components, we can examine each one independently to gain a thorough understanding of the entire interface.</p>
<p>As you can see here, we have identified six primary areas of the interface. We will examine each of these in subsequent sections. As you will quickly learn, this interface is customizable. The following screenshot shows the default configuration of the Unity user interface.</p>
<div><img src="img/db37445f-c399-47b9-b0dd-216ce11db19a.png"/></div>
<p>Overview of the Unity game engine user interface.</p>
<p>In the next sections, we will cover each of the following components indicated by the preceding screenshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menu</li>
<li>Scene view</li>
<li>Game view</li>
<li>Project window</li>
<li>Hierarchy window</li>
<li>Inspector window</li>
<li>Toolbar</li>
<li>Layouts</li>
</ul>
<p>Unity 2017 was the latest release when this book was published, so the screenshots reflect the Unity 2017 interfaces. Unity 2018 was available in beta so interface differences are provided in information boxes throughout the chapter.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Menu</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Unity editor's main menu bar, as depicted here, consists of eight pull-down options. We will briefly review each menu option in this section. Additional details will be provided in subsequent chapters, as we start developing our <em>Cucumber Beetle</em> game:</p>
<div><img height="16" width="423" src="img/22e6017b-2c4a-4763-91f5-b662dbf150cf.png"/></div>
<p>Unity's menus are contextual. This means that only menu items pertinent to the currently selected object will be enabled. Other non-applicable menu items will appear as gray instead of black and not be selectable.</p>
<p>Starting with Unity 2018, an additional top menu is Mobile Input. This menu item allows you to toggle mobile input on and off.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Unity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Unity menu item, shown here, gives us access to information about Unity, our software license, display options, module information, and access to preferences:</p>
<div><img height="206" width="141" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-499 image-border" src="img/168b0480-d54a-4b04-90e8-bf2924b8b44c.png"/></div>
<p>Accessing the Unity | About Unity... menu option gives you access to the version of the engine you are running. There is additional information as well, but you would probably only use this menu option to check your Unity version.</p>
<p>The Unity | Preferences... option brings up the Unity Preferences dialog window. That interface has seven side tabs: General, External Tools, Colors, Keys, GI Cache, 2D, and Cache Server. You are encouraged to become familiar with them as you gain experience in Unity. We will use the External Tools tab in <a href="e8407796-3bbd-4f54-bbcc-e1bd89284de5.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Optimizing Our Game for Deployment</em>.</p>
<p>The Unity | Modules option provides you with a list of playback engines that are running as well as any Unity extensions. </p>
<p>You can quit the Unity game engine by selecting the Unity | Quit menu option.</p>
<p>In Unity 2018, the Unity menu item is not present. The functionality will be moved to the Help menu.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">File</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Unity's File menu includes access to your game's scenes and projects. We will use these features throughout our game development process. As you can see in the following screenshot, we also have access to the Build Settings.... We will explore this functionality in <a href="e8407796-3bbd-4f54-bbcc-e1bd89284de5.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Optimizing Our Game for Deployment</em>.</p>
<div><img height="237" width="170" src="img/a3670b5d-3dae-4161-8433-1b915ff78e47.png"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Edit</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Edit menu has similar functionality to standard editors, not just game engines. For example, the standard Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Undo, and Redo options are there. Moreover, the short keys are aligned with the software industry standard. </p>
<p>As you can see from the following screenshot, there is additional functionality accessible here. There are play, pause, and step commands. We can also sign in and out of our Unity account: </p>
<div><img height="435" width="172" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-501 image-border" src="img/5dc7e792-aba4-4318-bd56-69871e5bdf9f.png"/></div>
<p>The Edit | Project Settings option gives us access to Input, Tags and Layers, Audio, Time, Player, Physics, Physics 2D, Quality, Graphics, Network, Editor, and Script Execution Order. In most cases, selecting one of these options opens or focuses keyboard control to the specific functionality.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Assets</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We will use the Assets menu functions extensively throughout this book, starting with <a href="f9370800-eaf9-4593-8a9c-8252c85e22ac.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Creating Our Terrain</em>. Assets are representations of things that we can use in our game. Examples include audio files, art files, and 3D models. There are several types of assets that can be used in Unity. As you can see from the following screenshot, we are able to create, import, and export assets:</p>
<div><img height="333" width="186" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-502 image-border" src="img/a8da538b-45f7-4f40-b968-cb5b24a3c7db.png"/></div>
<p>You will become increasingly familiar with this collection of functionality as you progress through the book and start developing your game.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">GameObject</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The GameObject menu provides us with the ability to create and manipulate GameObjects. In Unity, GameObjects are things we use in our game such as lights, cameras, 3D objects, trees, characters, cars, and so much more. As you can see here, we can create an empty GameObject as well as an empty child GameObject:</p>
<div><img height="363" width="168" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-503 image-border" src="img/f6c45608-b43b-4fdb-b788-a91bfb5a5bcd.png"/></div>
<p>We will have extensive hands-on dealings with the GameObject menu items throughout this book. At this point, it is important that you know this is where you go to create GameObjects as well as perform some manipulations on them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Component</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the last section, we mentioned that GameObjects are just <em>things</em>. They actually only become meaningful when we add components to them. Components are an important concept in Unity, and we will be working with them a lot as we progress with our game's development. It is the components that implement functionality for our GameObjects. </p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the various categories of components. This is one method for creating components in Unity:</p>
<div><img height="321" width="157" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-504 image-border" src="img/34e22736-9068-40b2-a77d-4b656182c6db.png"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Window</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Window menu option provides access to a lot of extra features. As you can see here, there is a Minimize option that will minimize the main Unity editor window. The Zoom option toggles full screen and zoomed view:</p>
<div><img height="466" width="136" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-505 image-border" src="img/1a2e98e4-1d9d-46c7-939f-808da856c685.png"/></div>
<p>The Layouts option provides access to various editor layouts, to save or delete a layout. Layouts will be covered in greater depth later in this chapter. </p>
<p>The following table provides a brief description for the remaining options available via the Window menu item. You will gain hands-on experience with these windows as you progress through this book:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Project window</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Project window is one that you will use frequently and provides quick access to objects in your project. As you can see here, the Project window is organized in a hierarchical view on the left. Selecting a folder on the left reveals the contents in the panel on the right.</p>
<p>That panel displays breadcrumbs on top and has a slider in the bottom-right corner to control the size of the icons:</p>
<div><img height="348" width="610" src="img/6350c0fc-e205-4b50-8312-864053a53516.png"/></div>
<p>The Create drop-down menu in the top-left section of the Project window gives you quick access to creating a game asset in the current folder.</p>
<p>To the right of the Create drop-down menu is a search bar followed by three icons. The first two icons are Search by Type and Search by Label, respectively. The third icon allows you to save your search.</p>
<p>The contents of the Project window provided in this section are representative and not part of this book's game.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Hierarchy window</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Hierarchy window lists all GameObjects in the current scene. This is different than what is displayed in the Project window because a game project contains one or more scenes, and not every object in a project is in a scene. As you can see in the following screenshot, some items in the Hierarchy window have a triangle on the left. Clicking a triangle will expand the contents, showing child objects. Parenting, or subordinating GameObjects with one another, is important and something that you will gain exposure to as you start adding GameObjects to your game:</p>
<div><img height="280" width="185" src="img/0d9f744a-fe1f-4120-b021-e4738dfa1070.png"/></div>
<p>The Create drop-down menu in the top-left section of the Hierarchy window gives you quick access to creating game assets.</p>
<p>To the right of the Create drop-down menu is a search bar. Below the search bar and to the right is a menu icon. Clicking that icon reveals the following list of options:</p>
<div><img height="224" width="147" src="img/63b6556b-ac3c-4100-9b0f-c8306df31681.png"/></div>
<p>As you can see from the menu above, it is contextual so not all items will be enabled all the time.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Inspector window </h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Inspector window is where we can inspect our GameObjects. You will remember that GameObjects are composed of more than one component, and those components are what make the GameObjects worth having in our games. </p>
<p>This example screenshot shows a ThirdPersonController GameObject with 11 components. The gray triangles to the left of each component allow you to expand the component and make any desired changes to that component's properties:</p>
<div><img height="313" width="296" src="img/bde93bc4-8d8f-4b46-a0a3-ca7736826e67.png"/></div>
<p>When you select a GameObject in Scene view, the Hierarchy window, or the Project window, the Inspector window will display the selected GameObject's components and properties. Each component has a different set of properties.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Inspector window, when a GameObject has been selected, you will see the Add Component button. Clicking this button allows you to add a component to the current GameObject. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Toolbar</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Unity's toolbar, depicted here, is located at the very top of the editor's interface. It spans the entire width of the window, and spacing is dependent on the current width.</p>
<div><img src="img/1ba8eb49-630d-40ce-a480-c93f2f16e647.png"/></div>
<p>The toolbar can be, theoretically, organized into the following categories: Transform Tools, Gizmo Toggles, Play Buttons, Cloud and Account Buttons, and Layers and Layouts. We covered the Play Buttons in the <em>Game view</em> section; the remaining toolbar categories are detailed as follows.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Transform tools</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The transform tools are a set of five fundamental tools for manipulating GameObjects in the Scene view. Each tool is represented by an icon:</p>
<div><img height="28" width="158" src="img/84043c14-d888-41ad-9869-805a62586cb9.png"/></div>
<p>The first button is the Hand tool or View tool. When this tool is selected, our cursor in the Scene view turns to a hand. This lets us know which mode we are in. With this tool selected, we can scroll with our mouse to zoom in and out of the scene. If you click on the left mouse button, you are able to pan around the scene. With the right mouse button clicked, you are able to look around, based on the current position of your cursor.</p>
<p>If you hold down the <em>Alt</em> key on a PC or <em>Option</em> key on a Mac and click on the left mouse button, you can orbit around the current area. Pressing that same key and the right mouse button allows you to zoom in and out of the scene.</p>
<p>The second button is the Translate tool and is in the shape of a quad arrow. When an object is selected, click on the translate tool; the object will have three gizmos, one for each axis. Clicking and dragging any of these gizmos moves the object along the respective axes, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/f17d59f7-f03e-4484-b5e9-eeb0c8ca7f5a.png"/></div>
<p>Cube with Transform Translate Tool </p>
<p>The third transform tool is the Rotate tool, which looks like two rotating arrows. This tool allows us to rotate an object along any axis (<kbd>x</kbd>, <kbd>y</kbd>, or <kbd>z</kbd>). Instead of line and arrow gizmos, this tool is instantiated with three colored rings, one for each axis. Clicking a ring and dragging it rotates the object along that axis, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img height="251" width="248" src="img/8a0ee47c-7828-40c6-9509-387d599772e8.png"/></div>
<p>Cube with Transform Rotate Tool </p>
<p>The fourth transform tool is the Scale tool, which is represented with line and block gizmos. Like the other transform tools, there is one gizmo for each axis. Clicking and dragging one of these gizmos increases or decreases the object along the selected axis. For example, you can make a cube wider, narrower, taller, or shorter. If you want to maintain aspect ratio, you can click on the center square instead of the red, blue, or green square. Now, when you click and drag, your object will grow or shrink in perfect aspect ratio, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img height="215" width="245" src="img/079074a0-37db-436b-b328-4f3c58f975c5.png"/></div>
<p>Cube with Transform Scale Tool </p>
<p>The final transform tool is the Rect tool and is represented by a rectangle with intersecting points. The Rect tool can be used to move, resize, and rotate an object in the Scene view. So, this is a versatile tool that also has corresponding properties that you can edit directly using the Inspector view. Take a look at the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img height="215" width="230" src="img/d125d85d-ff51-41e8-81fb-a148b2d7f43b.png"/></div>
<p>Cube with Transform Rect Tool </p>
<p>Unity 2018 will introduce a sixth transform tool that will permit the moving, rotating, and scaling of selected objects.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Gizmo Toggles</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As shown here, there are two Gizmo Toggles on the toolbar, called <strong>Transform Gizmo Toggles</strong>:</p>
<div><img src="img/1dde17d7-278d-4b49-a260-f18c89f60df2.png"/></div>
<p>Transform Gizmo Toggles: Center and Global</p>
<p>The first is a toggle between Center and Pivot. The second toggle is between Global and Local.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Cloud and Account Buttons</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are three buttons in this category, as shown here:</p>
<div><img height="33" width="231" src="img/31bb3c58-6e6e-49b9-941e-59a0435f610f.png"/></div>
<p>Toolbar: Collab, Cloud and Action buttons</p>
<p>The first button is the Collab, or Collaboration, button. If you are using an integrated collaboration tool, you can access the history of changes to your project here.</p>
<p>The second button is the Cloud button. This simply opens the Unity services window.</p>
<p>The third button is the Account button. This is a drop-down button that allows you to access your Unity account. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Layers and Layouts</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The final section of buttons on the toolbar consists of the Layers drop-down and the Layout drop-down buttons. These buttons are illustrated beneath and are located in the far-right end of the toolbar:</p>
<div><img height="29" width="171" src="img/8b5bebfa-79c5-4b6a-be01-4ce719eda332.png"/></div>
<p>Toolbar: Layers and Layout Dropdown Buttons</p>
<p>Selecting the Layers drop-down button allows you to select what layers you want to view, not view, and which ones you want to lock. Also, as you can see here, you have access to edit layers:</p>
<div><img height="141" width="165" src="img/9d6053d4-ab9e-4f88-be22-00f39c9cfdd7.png"/></div>
<p>Editing layers consists of creating user-defined layers that you can reorder and rename.</p>
<p>The Layout drop-down reveals the set of options:</p>
<div><img height="142" width="168" src="img/e99f5cd0-2c44-4b93-94e0-04ff6082ca03.png"/></div>
<p>Layouts are covered in the next section.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Layouts</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>One of the wonderful things about working with Unity is that you can customize the way the user interface is laid out. You can use one of the predefined layouts of 2 by 3, 4 Split, Tall, or Wide, or you can create your own. Layouts refer to how the various views in Unity are arranged on the screen. </p>
<p>To change a layout, we simply click on the Layout button that is located in the far top-right corner of the Unity interface. Let's look at each layout to see the differences.</p>
<p>The first layout is the 2 by 3 layout. This layout provides a nice arrangement with the Scene and Game views on the left, the Hierarchy and Project views in the middle and a full Inspector view on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/5389e212-af40-475d-9022-a6a72e335ba2.png"/></div>
<p>The 4 Split layout provides four different views of the same scene, as shown in the following screenshot. This is a good way to review how lighting and shading is implemented in your game. We'll talk about lighting and shading later in the book. The 4 Split layout is shown here:</p>
<div><img src="img/2d2af0b1-4075-4b1a-bd0b-052f638b8a3b.png"/></div>
<p>The Tall layout provides a tall, but not wide, view of the Scene view with other views located on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/6aae8bc9-0da5-4dad-84ea-1241a22b163e.png"/></div>
<p>The Wide layout provides a wide view of the Scene view, with other views located on the bottom and on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/2cb01417-b22f-420e-bc86-f1aec1c37c79.png"/></div>
<p>The Default layout is a variation of the Wide layout. The difference is that with the Default layout, the Hierarchy view is on the left, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/e102d877-4043-4bb9-b880-836edbb9184c.png"/></div>
<p>You can switch between layouts any time you want, without it impacting your game. Most Unity developers do not work in just one layout. Different layouts provide different benefits and are appropriate for different tasks. You can also modify any layout by dragging any of the borders of a view or window. If you want to save a layout, make any changes to the current layout, then select the Layout button and select Save Layout. You will be prompted for a name.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we examined the primary components of the Unity user interface. This included the Scene and Game views. We also looked at the Project, Hierarchy, and Inspector windows. We then reviewed the various layouts as well as the toolbar. Lastly, we established that additional interface components will be covered in subsequent chapters as new functionality and tools are introduced.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will start designing our <em>3D Cucumber Beetle</em> game. This design will inform our development of the game throughout the rest of the book. </p>
