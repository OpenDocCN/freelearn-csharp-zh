{
    private Vector2 startTouchPosition, endTouchPosition;
    public float minSwipeDistance = 50f;
    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.touchCount &gt; 0)
        {
            Touch touch = Input.GetTouch(0);
            if (touch.phase == TouchPhase.Began)
            {
                startTouchPosition = touch.position;
            }
            else if (touch.phase == TouchPhase.Ended)
            {
                endTouchPosition = touch.position;
                DetectSwipe();
            }
        }
    }
    void DetectSwipe()
    {
        if (Vector2.Distance(startTouchPosition, endTouchPosition) &gt;=
            minSwipeDistance)
        {
            Vector2 swipeDirection = endTouchPosition -

			<pre class="source-code">
using UnityEngine;
public class MotionControl : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float sensitivity = 1.0f;
    void Update()
    {
        Vector3 tilt = Input.acceleration * sensitivity;
        // Use tilt.x to control horizontal movement and tilt.y to
        //      control forward/backward movement
        // Mapping tilt.y to the z argument of transform.Translate for
        //      forward/backward movement in a 3D space
        transform.Translate(tilt.x, 0, tilt.y);
    }
}</pre>			<p>This script uses a device’s accelerometer to detect a tilt and moves the game object accordingly, based on the tilt direction and sensitivity. The <strong class="source-inline">sensitivity</strong> variable allows adjustment of how responsive the movement is to the device’s tilt. In the <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> method, <strong class="source-inline">Input.acceleration</strong> captures the device’s tilt and multiplies it by the sensitivity.

			<pre class="source-code">
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
public class ResponsiveButton : MonoBehaviour
{
    public CanvasScaler canvasScaler;
    public Button myButton;
    void Start()
    {
        // Configure the CanvasScaler for resolution independence
        canvasScaler.uiScaleMode =
             CanvasScaler.ScaleMode.ScaleWithScreenSize;
        canvasScaler.referenceResolution = new Vector2(1920, 1080);
        // Set up the button's Rect Transform to anchor to the bottom-
           right corner
        RectTransform buttonRectTransform =
            myButton.GetComponent&lt;RectTransform&gt;();
        buttonRectTransform.anchorMin = new Vector2(1, 0);
        buttonRectTransform.anchorMax = new Vector2(1, 0);
        buttonRectTransform.pivot = new Vector2(1, 0);
        buttonRectTransform.anchoredPosition = new Vector2(-50, 50);
        // Add an onClick listener to provide haptic feedback
        myButton.onClick.AddListener(TriggerHapticFeedback);
    }

    {
        if (SystemInfo.supportsVibration)
        {
            Handheld.Vibrate();
        }
    }
}</pre>			<p>In this example, we set up <strong class="source-inline">CanvasScaler</strong> to ensure resolution independence, allowing the UI to scale<a id="_idIndexMarker1357"/> appropriately across different screen sizes. The button is anchored to the bottom-right corner, making it responsive to changes in screen dimensions. Additionally, we add haptic feedback to the button’s <strong class="source-inline">onClick</strong> event to enhance <span class="No-Break">the UX.</span></p>
			<p>Resolution independence and aspect ratios are fundamental concepts in responsive UI design. Ensuring that your UI elements scale and position correctly across various devices involves understanding and working with these principles. The <strong class="source-inline">CanvasScaler</strong> component plays a crucial role in achieving this, as it allows you to specify a reference resolution and automatically adjusts the scale of UI elements to match the actual <span class="No-Break">screen size.</span></p>
			<p>In summary, understanding the <a id="_idIndexMarker1358"/>fundamentals of responsive UI design in Unity involves mastering the core components of uGUI, such as the <strong class="bold">Canvas</strong> and <strong class="bold">RectTransform</strong>, and ensuring resolution independence. By using tools such as <strong class="source-inline">CanvasScaler</strong>, developers can create adaptable and consistent UIs for various screen sizes and resolutions. As we proceed, we will explore the use of anchors and dynamic layouts to further enhance the responsiveness and flexibility of our <span class="No-Break">UI designs.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-362"><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>Utilizing anchors and dynamic layouts</h2>
			<p>Achieving responsive<a id="_idIndexMarker1359"/> UI designs in Unity involves effectively using anchoring and<a id="_idIndexMarker1360"/> dynamic layout components. Anchors<a id="_idIndexMarker1361"/> allow UI elements to be positioned relative to their parent container, providing flexibility across various screen dimensions. Dynamic layout components, such<a id="_idIndexMarker1362"/> as <strong class="bold">Horizontal Layout Group</strong>, <strong class="bold">Vertical Layout Group</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Grid Layout Group</strong>, enable the automatic adjustment of <a id="_idIndexMarker1363"/>UI elements based<a id="_idIndexMarker1364"/> on screen size and orientation. This section dives into these techniques, providing practical examples of setting up responsive layouts for both landscape and <span class="No-Break">portrait modes.</span></p>
			<p>Anchors in Unity are a powerful tool to make UI elements responsive. By setting anchor points, you can define how UI elements should behave relative to their parent container when a screen size changes. Anchors are particularly useful for maintaining consistent positioning and sizing of UI elements across <span class="No-Break">different devices.</span></p>
			<p>For example, to create a UI element that remains centered on the screen, you can set its anchor points to <span class="No-Break">the center:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
public class CenteredUI : MonoBehaviour
{
    public RectTransform uiElement;
    void Start()
    {
        // Set the anchor points to the center
        uiElement.anchorMin = new Vector2(0.5f, 0.5f);
        uiElement.anchorMax = new Vector2(0.5f, 0.5f);
        uiElement.pivot = new Vector2(0.5f, 0.5f);
        uiElement.anchoredPosition = Vector2.zero;
    }
}</pre>			<p>This script <a id="_idIndexMarker1365"/>centers a UI element by setting its anchor points, pivot, and position to the center of its parent container. The <strong class="source-inline">uiElement's RectTransform</strong> is adjusted so that the anchor points and pivot are both set to <strong class="source-inline">(0.5, 0.5)</strong>, the exact center of the UI element, and its <strong class="source-inline">anchoredPosition</strong> value is set to zero. This centers the pivot of the UI element, which is the reference point for any future movement, rotation, <span class="No-Break">or scaling.</span></p>
			<p>Utilizing layout groups enables the automatic adjustment of UI elements based on screen size and orientation, by positioning and sizing child elements according to the available space and layout settings. This ensures a flexible and adaptive <span class="No-Break">UI design.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Horizontal Layout Group</strong> component<a id="_idIndexMarker1366"/> arranges its <a id="_idIndexMarker1367"/>children in a horizontal line, adjusting their positions and sizes dynamically. Similarly, the <strong class="bold">Vertical Layout </strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker1368"/></strong><strong class="bold">Group</strong> component arranges its children vertically. The <strong class="bold">Grid Layout Group</strong> component <a id="_idIndexMarker1369"/>organizes its children into a grid, making it ideal for creating responsive grids of <span class="No-Break">UI elements.</span></p>
			<p>A common requirement in a video game is to create a column of buttons. The following script generates <span class="No-Break">that column:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
public class VerticalList : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject itemPrefab;
    public Transform contentPanel;
    void Start()
    {
        PopulateList();
    }
    void PopulateList()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        {
            GameObject newItem = Instantiate(itemPrefab, 
              contentPanel);
            // Ensure the prefab contains a Text component
            Text itemText = newItem.GetComponentInChildren&lt;Text&gt;();
            if (itemText != null)
            {
                itemText.text = "Item " + i;
            }
            else
            {
                Debug.LogError("Item prefab does not contain a Text component.");
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>			<p>This script creates a column <a id="_idIndexMarker1370"/>of buttons and adds them to a parent container. <strong class="source-inline">buttonPrefab</strong> references the button template, and <strong class="source-inline">contentParent</strong> is where the buttons will be added. In the <strong class="source-inline">Start</strong> method, a loop instantiates <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> buttons, sets their parent to <strong class="source-inline">contentParent</strong>, and updates their text to <strong class="source-inline">Button</strong>, followed by their index number. This method efficiently generates a list of buttons for a menu <span class="No-Break">or interface.</span></p>
			<p>To accommodate both landscape and portrait modes, you can use a combination of anchors and layout groups. For example, a UI panel that adjusts its layout based on the screen orientation can be set up <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
public class ResponsivePanel : MonoBehaviour
{
    public RectTransform panel;
    void Update()
    {
        if (Screen.width &gt; Screen.height) // Landscape mode
        {
            panel.anchorMin = new Vector2(0.25f, 0.25f);
            panel.anchorMax = new Vector2(0.75f, 0.75f);
        }
        else // Portrait mode
        {
            panel.anchorMin = new Vector2(0.1f, 0.1f);
            panel.anchorMax = new Vector2(0.9f, 0.9f);
        }
    }
}</pre>			<p>This script adjusts a <a id="_idIndexMarker1371"/>panel’s anchors based on screen orientation. The <strong class="source-inline">panel</strong> variable references the RectTransform of the panel. In the <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> method, if the screen is in landscape mode, the anchors are set to <strong class="source-inline">(0.25, 0.25)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">(0.75, 0.75)</strong>. If the screen is in portrait mode, the anchors are set to <strong class="source-inline">(0.1, 0.1)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">(0.9, 0.9)</strong>. This ensures that the panel is appropriately scaled and positioned for <span class="No-Break">both orientations.</span></p>
			<p>By effectively utilizing anchors and dynamic layout components, you can ensure that your UI elements remain responsive and adaptable across different screen sizes <span class="No-Break">and orientations.</span></p>
