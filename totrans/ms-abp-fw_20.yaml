    publicly. If the library is not public, we can host a private NuGet server in

- en: The Payment module needs some database tables to work properly. We can use the
    main EventHub database to store the Payment module's tables. With this approach,
    we will have a single database for the system. Alternatively, we can create a
    separate database for the Payment module so that we have two databases. The EventHub
    solution prefers the first approach since it is simpler to implement and manage.
    However, I will also show how we would implement the separate database approach.
    Let's begin with the single database approach.
