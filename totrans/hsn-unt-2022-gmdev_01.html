    <h1 id="_idParaDest-14" class="chapterTitle">Creating a Unity Project</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we will learn how to install Unity and create a project with Unity Hub, a tool that manages different Unity installations and projects, among other tasks. Unity Hub gives easy access to community blogs, forums, resources, and learning portals; it also manages your licenses, and allows you to change the building platform before opening the project on top of managing different installs and projects. </p>
    <p class="normal">Specifically, we will examine the following concepts in this chapter: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Installing Unity</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating projects</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by talking about how to get Unity up and running.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-15" class="heading-1">Installing Unity</h1>
    <p class="normal">We’ll begin with <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>a simple but necessary first step: installing Unity. It seems like a straightforward first step, but we can discuss the proper ways to do this. In this section, we will be looking at the following concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Unity’s technical requirements</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Unity versioning</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Installing Unity with Unity Hub</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">First, we will discuss what is necessary to run Unity on our computers.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-16" class="heading-2">Unity’s technical requirements</h2>
    <p class="normal">To run Unity 2022, your <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>computer will need to meet the following operating system requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">If you use Windows, you need Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or greater, Windows 10, or Windows 11. Unity will run only on 64-bit versions of those systems; there is no 32-bit support unless you are willing to work with Unity versions before 2017.x, but that’s outside the scope of this book.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">For Mac, you need Big Sur 11.0 to run Apple silicon versions of the editor. In any other case, you can run Intel versions of the editor from High Sierra 10.13 or superior.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">For Linux, you need exactly Ubuntu 20.04, 18.04, or CentOS 7.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Regarding the CPU, these are the requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Your CPU needs to support 64 bits</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Your CPU needs to support SSE2 (most CPUs support it)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">In the case of Macs with Apple silicon, M1 or above is needed</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Finally, regarding graphics cards, these are the supported ones:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">On Windows, we need a graphics card with DirectX 10, 11, or 12 support (most modern GPUs support it)</li>
      <li class="bulletList">On Mac, any Metal-capable Intel or AMD GPU will be enough</li>
      <li class="bulletList">On Linux, OpenGL 3.2 or any superior version, or a Vulkan-compatible card from Nvidia and AMD is supported</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Now that we know the requirements, let’s discuss the Unity installation management system.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-17" class="heading-2">Unity versioning</h2>
    <p class="normal">Unity releases a new major version each year—at the time of writing, 2022.1—and during that year it receives an update with<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> new features, which is planned to be 2022.2 at the time of writing this book. Near the end of the year or during the beginning of the next<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> one, an <strong class="keyWord">LTS</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">long-term support</strong>) version is released, which will be 2022.3 for this edition of the book, marking the end of new features being added to that year’s version of the engine. After that, the next year’s edition of the engine is released, and the cycle repeats. </p>
    <p class="normal">LTS versions have the benefit that they are planned to be updated bi-weekly with bug fixes for 2 years, while new major versions of Unity release. That’s the reason most companies stick to LTS versions of the engine: because of its stability and long-term support. In this book we will be using 2022.1 just to explore the new features of the engine, but consider sticking to LTS versions when developing commercial game titles.</p>
    <p class="normal">Considering this, you may need to have several versions of Unity installed in case you work on different projects made with different versions. You may be wondering why you can’t just use the latest version of Unity for every project, but there are some problems with that. </p>
    <p class="normal">In newer versions of Unity, there <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>are usually lots of changes to how the engine works, so you may need to rework lots of pieces of the game to upgrade it, including third-party plugins. It can take lots of time to upgrade the whole project, and that can push the release date back. Maybe you need a specific feature that comes with an update that will help you. In such a case, the cost of upgrading may be worthwhile. For projects that are maintained and updated for several years, developers are used to updates only to the latest LTS versions of the editor, although this policy may vary from case to case.</p>
    <p class="normal">Managing different projects made with different Unity versions, and installing and updating new Unity releases, all used to be a huge hassle. Thus, <strong class="keyWord">Unity Hub</strong> was created to help us with this, and it has become the default way to install Unity. Despite this, it is not necessary for installing Unity, but we will keep things simple for now and use it. Let’s look closer into it.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-18" class="heading-2">Installing Unity with Unity Hub</h2>
    <p class="normal">Unity Hub is a small piece <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>of software that we will install before installing Unity. It <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>centralizes the management of all your Unity projects and installations. You can get it from the official Unity website. The steps to download it change frequently, but at the time of writing this book, you need to do the following:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Go to <a href="http://unity.com">unity.com</a>.</li>

      <li class="numberedList">Follow the instructions of the installer, which will mostly be clicking <strong class="screenText">Next</strong> all the way to the end.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have Unity Hub installed, we must use it to install a specific Unity version. You can do this with the following steps:</p>

      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Start <strong class="screenText">Unity Hub</strong>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">If prompted to<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> install a Unity version and/or create a license, please skip these steps with the corresponding <strong class="screenText">Skip</strong> buttons (which may<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> vary according to the Unity Hub version). This way to install Unity and licenses is only available the first time you run Unity Hub, but we are going to learn the way to do this that works after the first time.</li>

    <p class="normal">Remember that the <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>preceding steps may be different in new Unity Hub<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> versions, so just try to follow the flow that Unity designed—most of the time, it is intuitive.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now it is time to create a project using Unity.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-19" class="heading-1">Creating projects</h1>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have Unity installed, we<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> can start creating our game. To do so, we first need to create a project, which is basically a folder containing all the files that your game will be composed of. These files <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>are called <strong class="keyWord">assets</strong> and there are different types of them, such as images, audio, 3D models, script files, and so on. In this section, we will see how to manage a project, addressing the following concepts:</p>

      <li class="bulletList">Creating a project</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Project structure</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let’s learn first how to create a blank project to start developing our project.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-20" class="heading-2">Creating a project</h2>
    <p class="normal">As with Unity installations, we will use the Unity Hub to manage projects. We need to follow these next steps to create one:</p>

      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the Unity Hub and click on the <strong class="screenText">Projects</strong> button, and then click on <strong class="screenText">New project</strong>:</li>

      <li class="numberedList" value="2">Pick the <strong class="screenText">3D (URP)</strong> template as we will be creating a 3D game with simple graphics, prepared to run on every device<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> Unity can be executed on, so the <strong class="keyWord">Universal Render Pipeline</strong> (or <strong class="keyWord">URP</strong>) is the better<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> choice for that.

    <p class="normal">Now that we have created the project, let’s explore its structure.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-21" class="heading-2">Project structure</h2>
    <p class="normal">We have just opened Unity, but<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> we won’t start using it until the next chapter. Now, it’s time to see how the project folder structure is composed. To do so, we need to open the folder in which we created the project. If you don’t remember where this is, you can do the following:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Right-click the <strong class="screenText">Assets</strong> folder in<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> the <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> panel, located at the bottom part of the editor.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click the <strong class="screenText">Show in Explorer</strong> option (if you are using a Mac, the option is called <strong class="screenText">Reveal in Finder</strong>). The following screenshot illustrates this:</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.22: Opening the project folder in Explorer</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="3">Then, you will see a folder structure similar to this one (some files or folders may vary):</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B18585_01_23.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.23: Unity project folder structure</p>
    <p class="normal">If you want to move this project to another PC or send it to a colleague, you can just compress all those files and send it to them as a ZIP file, but not all the folders are necessary all of the time. The important folders are <strong class="screenText">Assets</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Packages</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">ProjectSettings</strong>. <strong class="screenText">Assets</strong> will hold all the files we will create and use for our game, so this is a must. We will also configure different Unity systems to tailor the engine to our game; all the settings related to this are in the <strong class="screenText">ProjectSettings </strong>and <strong class="screenText">UserSettings</strong> folders. Finally, we will install different Unity modules or packages to expand its functionality, so the <strong class="screenText">Packages</strong> folder will hold which ones we are using. </p>
    <p class="normal">It’s not necessary to copy the rest <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>of the folders if you need to move the project elsewhere or add it to any versioning system, but let’s at least discuss what the <strong class="screenText">Library</strong> folder is, especially considering it’s usually a huge size. Unity needs to convert the files we will use to its own format in order to operate, and an example would be audio <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>and graphics. Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>supports <strong class="keyWord">MPEG Audio Layer 3</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">MP3</strong>), <strong class="keyWord">Waveform Audio File Format </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">WAV</strong>), <strong class="keyWord">Portable Network Graphics</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">PNG</strong>), and <strong class="keyWord">Joint Photographic Experts Group</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">JPG</strong>) files (and much <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>more), but <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>prior to using them, they need to be converted to Unity’s internal formats, a process <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>called <strong class="keyWord">Importing Assets</strong>. Those converted files will be in the <strong class="screenText">Library </strong>folder. If you copy the project without that folder, Unity will simply take the original files in the <strong class="screenText">Assets</strong> folder and recreate the <strong class="screenText">Library</strong> folder entirely. This process can take time, and the bigger the project, the more time involved.</p>
    <p class="normal">Keep in mind that you want to have all the folders Unity created while you are working on the project, so don’t delete any of them while you work on it, but if you need to move an entire project, you now know exactly what you need to take with you. </p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-22" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we reviewed how the Unity versioning system works. We also saw how to install and manage different Unity versions using Unity Hub. Finally, we created and managed multiple projects with the same tool. We will use Unity Hub a lot, so it is important to know how to use it initially.
