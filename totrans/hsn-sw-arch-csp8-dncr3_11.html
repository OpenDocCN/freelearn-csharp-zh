<p>In this section, you will learn about the main patterns, best practices, and frameworks used in modern enterprise architectures. All examples are on C# 8 running on .NET Core 3.0. </p>
<p>In <a href="a2d50e08-6698-47f6-a9b5-188de08134c0.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Design Patterns and .NET Core Implementation</em>, you will learn about the .NET Core implementation of well-known and general patterns and best practices, while <a href="4e308a45-a1ff-4a45-bea9-ba648b1e9ccd.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Implementing Code Reusability in C# 8</em>, describes techniques and best practices that enhance code reusability. </p>
<p><a href="2a42483c-2193-4bd4-91b4-0fdce94f6ed1.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Understanding the Different Domains in a Software Solution</em>, describes the modern domain-driven design software production methodology, which will enable you to get the most out of cloud- and microservice-based architectures and tackle complex applications that require several knowledge domains. There, you will learn both about analysis techniques and architectures and tools involved in projects based on domain-driven design.</p>
<p><a href="3ec4db7b-e570-41d0-94fb-2bdbd6dc4a9a.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Applying Service-Oriented Architectures with .NET Core</em>, and <a href="003ee8cb-5995-4364-8772-73d73df29cf8.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Presenting ASP.NET Core MVC</em>, describe web architectures that form the backbone of modern enterprise applications. Both chapters are based on ASP.NET Core 3.0, which is the web framework that comes with .Net Core 3.0. <a href="3ec4db7b-e570-41d0-94fb-2bdbd6dc4a9a.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Applying Service-Oriented Architectures with .NET Core</em>, describes web architectures where the enterprise system can be accessed by external client applications through endpoints exposed on the web or on a private network. <a href="3ec4db7b-e570-41d0-94fb-2bdbd6dc4a9a.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Applying Service-Oriented Architectures with .NET Core</em>, is dedicated to ASP.NET Core MVC web applications, which don't need specific clients because they use browsers as clients. More specifically, they interact with the user through the HTML they send to a standard browser.</p>
