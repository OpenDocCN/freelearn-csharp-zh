- en: Microsoft **Windows Presentation Foundation** (**WPF**) provides several libraries
    and APIs for developers to create engaging user experiences. This book features
    a wide range of simple to complex examples to demonstrate how to develop enterprise-grade
    applications for Windows desktop with WPF.

- en: This updated second edition of *Mastering Windows Presentation Foundation* starts
    by covering the benefits of using the **Model-View-View Model** (**MVVM**) software
    architectural pattern with WPF, before guiding you through debugging your WPF
    apps. The book will then take you through the application architecture and building
    the foundation layer for your apps. As you advance, you'll get to grips with data
    binding, explore the various built-in WPF controls, and customize them to suit
    your requirements.

- en: Filled with intriguing and practical examples, this book delineates concepts
    that will help you take your WPF skills to the next level. You'll learn to discover
    MVVM and how it assists in developing with WPF, implement your own custom application
    framework, understand how to adapt built-in controls, get up to speed with using
    animations, implement responsive data validation, create visually appealing user
    interfaces, and improve the performance of your app and learn how to deploy your
    applications.

- en: Also, you will discover a smarter way of working with WPF using the MVVM software
    architectural pattern, learn to create your own lightweight application framework
    to build your future applications upon, understand data binding, and learn how
    to use it in an application.

- en: You'll learn how to create custom controls to meet your needs when the built-in
    functionality is not enough. You'll also understand how to enhance your applications
    using practical animations, stunning visuals, and responsive data validation.
    To ensure that your app is not only interactive but also efficient, you'll focus
    on improving application performance and finally discover the different methods
    for deploying your applications. By the end of this book, you'll be proficient
    in using WPF for developing efficient yet robust user interfaces.
