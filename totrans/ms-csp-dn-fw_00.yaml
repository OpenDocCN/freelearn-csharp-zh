- en: .NET and the C# language have continuously grown in adoption since its release
    in early 2001\. C#'s main author, Anders Hejlsberg, has lead several groups of
    developers in constant growing and improvement, until reaching the current version,
    .NET 4.6, and the very important .NET Core 1.0/1.1, and keeps on going with this
    work, also linked to the new TypeScript language, which we will also cover in
    this book.

- en: This book is a journey through the different options and possibilities .NET
    Framework in general, and C# in particular, provide to developers to build applications
    that run on Windows and, as seen in the last chapter, on other platforms and devices.

    knowledge to the latest versions of this set of technologies, but also for those
    who, coming from other environments, would like to approach .NET and the C# language
    to extend their skills and programming toolset.
