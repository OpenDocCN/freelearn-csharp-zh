<h1 id="_idParaDest-283" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor302" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Finishing Games with Commercial Viability</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In <a href="B18347_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, we wrapped up the development process that started with us creating the 3D <strong class="bold">first-person shooter</strong> (<strong class="bold">FPS</strong>) game <a id="_idIndexMarker1610" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>and ended with us designing a truly immersive boss room encounter – in our own room – using <strong class="bold">mixed reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">MR</strong>). To <a id="_idIndexMarker1611" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>achieve this, we took advantage of the power and flexibility <a id="_idIndexMarker1612" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>of the <strong class="bold">Unity XR Interaction Toolkit</strong> (<strong class="bold">XRI</strong>) and combined 3D assets with our reusable components and systems from our previous work.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We also explored additional Unity-specific MR technologies such as AR Foundation, which we used to create immersive experiences using detected planes from the player’s physical surroundings. We used walls, floors, and tables to spawn virtual objects and create a virtual game environment. We also designed the boss room, set up Quest devices, and customized Unity’s Mixed Reality Template. Additionally, we crafted the interactive module Prefab Variants, along with puzzle and shooting mechanics, to deepen the player experience.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we’ll explore <strong class="bold">Games as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">GaaS</strong>), Unity DevOps and LiveOps resources, and source code management via a <strong class="bold">version control system</strong> (<strong class="bold">VCS</strong>). We’ll also discuss in-game economies for commercialization and finish by exploring different storefront platforms for distributing our games, including an example of implementing <strong class="bold">Unity Gaming Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">UGS</strong>) and publishing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topic<a id="_idTextAnchor303" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>s:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15">Introducing GaaS – UGS</li>
<li class="calibre15">Safeguarding your investment! Source code management with Unity Version Control</li>
<li class="calibre15">Engaging players with an in-game economy</li>
<li class="calibre15">Getting your game out there! Platform distribution</li>
<li class="calibre15">Implementing UGS and publishing</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">By the end of this chapter, you’ll have gained confidence in your ability to manage and secure your project development life cycle during both the production and release phases. You’ll also know how to distribute a commercially viable finished game effectively.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-284" class="calibre5">Technical requiremen<a id="_idTextAnchor304" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>ts</h1>
<p class="calibre3">To follow along in this chapter, you must have Unity Hub and a 2022 version of Unity Editor installed. You’ll also need to be able to sign in to Unity Cloud using your Unity ID account.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can download the complete project from GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unity-2022-by-Example" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unity-2022-by-Example</a>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-285" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor305" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Introducing GaaS – UGS</h1>
<p class="calibre3">The most important<a id="_idIndexMarker1613" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> lesson<a id="_idIndexMarker1614" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> is to finish your games. You have no potential to graduate as a hobbyist or have a self-sustaining career as an indie game developer unless you finish your games. A finished game also serves as proof of finely-tuned skills as a game developer and a showcase for studios, should you be looking to get hired by one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Therefore, finishing games boils down to treating the game-making process more like a business. This is <strong class="bold">GaaS</strong>, blending development and operating strategies to create dynamic, remarkable, commercial, and continuously evolving game experiences for players in your <em class="italic">business</em> of making games.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When developing a game using a GaaS model, the focus shifts more toward long-term engagement and monetization strategies in the later stages of production. If we aim to maximize commercial viability with our game’s release – for a sustained revenue stream – we’ll need to employ continuous content delivery, social interaction, and data analysis to guide our decision-making processes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Unity not only provides a game engine for the foundation of your game’s development but also cloud services you should leverage to increase your chance for success. Namely, <strong class="bold">Unity Cloud</strong> provides a<a id="_idIndexMarker1615" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> group of efficient and time-saving tools and workflows that substantially assist in securing your projects and releasing commercially viable games.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Additional reading | Unity Cloud</p>
<p class="callout">Unity Cloud: <a href="https://cloud.unity.com/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://cloud.unity.com/</a></p>
<p class="calibre3">Unity Cloud provides access to <strong class="bold">UGS</strong>, which they describe as “<em class="italic">a complete service ecosystem for live games</em>.” Considering the breadth of service offerings and ease of integration into our game projects, it should be no surprise why we would benefit from adopting one <a id="_idIndexMarker1616" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>or <a id="_idIndexMarker1617" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>more services.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here’s a quick rundown of what UGS provides:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Foundational game systems</strong>: Systems<a id="_idIndexMarker1618" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> such as authentication and player accounts enable cloud saves and platform crossplay, and content management enables deployment and dynamic updating of game content. Meanwhile, multiplayer game hosting can scale your game to millions of players (as games such as <strong class="bold">Among Us</strong> and <strong class="bold">Apex Legends</strong> did). Rounding things out are version control and build automation, which <a id="_idIndexMarker1619" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>comprise Unity’s <strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> features.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Player engagement</strong>: Features such as analytics enable data-driven decisions to maximize the player experience. Engagement tools with A/B testing allow features with the most player enjoyment to surface, while communications such as voice and text chat build communities. And don’t forget the ever-so-important crash reporting to know where your game crashes so that you can respond quickly with fixes. This grouping of services<a id="_idIndexMarker1620" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> is Unity’s <strong class="bold">LiveOps</strong> features.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Game growth</strong>: Grow your game with user acquisition and drive monetization revenue with in-game ads, ad mediation, and in-app purchase features to establish your game’s economy.</li>

<p class="calibre3">The aforementioned UGS topics can fill a whole book, so we’ll focus on just the core services that are crucial for game development production and are intended for commercial release in this chapter. That means we’ll focus<a id="_idIndexMarker1621" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> on <strong class="bold">Unity DevOps</strong> and <strong class="bold">Unity LiveOps</strong> in<a id="_idIndexMarker1622" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> this section, as well as the basics of a game economy and publishing in the following sections.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The success of GaaS depends on the complementary roles played by DevOps and LiveOps. DevOps is responsible for updating the game efficiently. At the same time, LiveOps decides which updates to include and how to engage players (determining what to buff or nerf in the game based on player engagement is a fun challenge!). Both tools work together to create a cycle of continuous improvement (that <a id="_idIndexMarker1623" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>is, <strong class="bold">Kaizen</strong>) that sustains and improves the game with updates over time.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Kaizen (改善)</p>
<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Kaizen</strong> is the<a id="_idIndexMarker1624" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> Sino-Japanese word for “improvement.” It’s all about continuous improvement. In game development, this could mean making small changes weekly or even daily to mechanics, balance, storylines, or even coding practices. It can help identify issues so that we can make adjustments early before they become more significant problems.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s explore these <a id="_idIndexMarker1625" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>core<a id="_idIndexMarker1626" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> services in more detail, starting with DevOps.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-286" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor306" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Introducing Unity DevOps</h2>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">DevOps</strong>, derived <a id="_idIndexMarker1627" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>from the fusion <a id="_idIndexMarker1628" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>of <strong class="bold">development</strong> (<strong class="bold">Dev</strong>) and <strong class="bold">operations</strong> (<strong class="bold">Ops</strong>) practices, plays<a id="_idIndexMarker1629" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> a vital role in software development and is particularly valuable in game development, especially in the application of GaaS. Unity DevOps tools facilitate accelerated development and deployment cycles – throughout the entire production life cycle – and help ensure reliable game releases.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Examining the problems that can be solved using Unity DevOps tools can help us better understand the benefits. The service offerings tackle essential challenges in game development by addressing critical aspects such as the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Managing assets (complex and/or large)</strong>: You can trust that your assets will be maintained and archived in your project repository, no matter the size or the complexity of their structure. This applies to working solo or in collaboration with a team.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Managing code base changes</strong>: In addition to managing assets, tracking changes via version history will ensure quality is maintained and progress on work is never lost.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Streamlining build and deployment</strong>: Automating the build process and deployment for your game’s executables significantly accelerates the distribution of updates – getting updates in the hands of your players quicker, whether that’s to squash bugs or improve player engagement.</li>
</ul>

<p class="callout">Unity DevOps: <a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-devops" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://unity.com/products/unity-devops</a></p>
<p class="calibre3">There are <a id="_idIndexMarker1630" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>two specific services Unity DevOps offers:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Unity Version Control</strong>: Game <a id="_idIndexMarker1631" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>development teams and solo developers can overcome project continuance challenges by using a specialized VCS that’s also tightly integrated with Unity Editor. Unity Version Control offers local and private cloud code repositories that provide a scalable collaboration platform for programmers, artists, and creators.</li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">You may be wondering why I suggest using Unity Version Control for our game development projects even though this book’s projects are shared with you through a link to GitHub at the beginning of each chapter. Well, the reason is straightforward: GitHub offers public repositories, which are commonly used for open source projects, while Unity Version Control does not provide this feature.</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Unity Build Automation</strong>: A customizable build pipeline that seamlessly integrates with Unity Version Control or third-party repositories (for example, <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong>, <strong class="bold">GitLab</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Bitbucket</strong>). It provides robust platform build (for example, on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS) and testing capabilities that streamline <a id="_idIndexMarker1632" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>the process of building and deploying game builds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">The Unity DevOps services are much more than the brief introductions provided here, so let’s explore each in more detail. We’ll start with Unity Version Control.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Unity Version Control</h3>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Unity Version Control</strong> (formerly <strong class="bold">Plastic SCM</strong>) is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1633" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>modern VCS that can be<a id="_idIndexMarker1634" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> used seamlessly<a id="_idIndexMarker1635" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> with Unity. It provides Unity-tailored version control capabilities and mitigates many of the risks associated with game development. For the record, you can use Unity Version Control with software platforms and projects other than Unity.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Additional reading | Unity Version Control</p>
<p class="callout">Unity Version Control: <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/version-control" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://unity.com/solutions/version-control</a></p>
<p class="calibre3">So, what is version control? Version control is a system that tracks file changes over time. It enables multiple people to collaborate on the same set of files and tracks the different file versions. It also allows you to revert to previous file versions if needed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As mentioned repeatedly, due to its importance, it’s crucial to use a VCS to avoid losing work while working on game development projects. Version control, a central pillar of DevOps, also enables team collaboration while more easily resolving conflicts that can occur with multiple people working on the same code base and assets.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As such, Unity Version Control offers the following essential VCS features:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Efficient management of large assets</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker1636" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Unity Version Control workspace optimizes handling large binary files in your projects (such as texture images and 3D model assets). Unlike other VCS offerings, which rely on problematic large file support add-ons, Unity Version Control ensures efficient storage and retrieval of large assets without any decrease in performance.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Enhanced collaboration with branching and merging</strong>: Unity Version Control provides robust capabilities for branching implemented features into isolated environments and merging changes when two people have worked on the same file. This makes for a smoother collaboration experience across the project and teams by managing parallel or asynchronous work effectively to mitigate conflicts.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Cloud archiving for project continuance</strong>: Most VCSs offer cloud archiving, as does Unity Version Control, which prevents losses from local system failures – which can and do occur! If your project source doesn’t exist in more than one location, it doesn’t exist. Yikes!</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Integration with DevOps pipelines</strong>: Unity Version Control works with any game engine or software development environment, not just Unity. There are integrations into<a id="_idIndexMarker1637" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> DevOps toolchains, issue-tracking applications, team communication platforms, IDEs, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Now, let’s explore <a id="_idIndexMarker1638" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Unity Build Automation, which picks up where Unity Version Control leaves off and is the second half of Unity DevOps.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Unity Build Automation</h3>
<p class="calibre3">Using <strong class="bold">Unity Build Automation</strong> tools, you<a id="_idIndexMarker1639" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> can <a id="_idIndexMarker1640" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>automate the process of creating and deploying builds across platforms, where frequent and reliable game updates are essential for GaaS in a DevOps environment – players can be brutal with developer expectations for rapid responses and high quality. As competitive as the games market can sometimes be, you generally get only one chance to hit a player’s expectations; otherwise, they’ll bail hard on your game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Build automation complements version control by addressing developer challenges related to an individual and manual build creation process, as well as consistency and efficiency across build distributions. A winning combination of version control and build automation achieves a comprehensive solution for managing game development workflows, from code management to build distribution.</p>

<p class="callout">Unity Build Automation: <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/ci-cd" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://unity.com/solutions/ci-cd</a></p>
<p class="calibre3">As such, Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker1641" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Build Automation offers the<a id="_idIndexMarker1642" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> following essential build features:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Streamlined central build process</strong>: Building <a id="_idIndexMarker1643" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>projects is a time-consuming endeavor, and keeping a developer’s system pegged at 100% CPU utilization during a build on their development machine crashes their productivity. Offloading the build and deployment processes from the local system to a cloud-based pipeline eliminates bottlenecks and provides a standardized process, especially when targeting multiple platforms.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Streamlined build deployment process</strong>: Automating the deployment process significantly saves time and eliminates the – error-prone – manual process of copying and uploading game builds to distribution servers across multiple platforms, ensuring your game binaries are always ready for release to your testing team (for solo Indie devs, this is your friends and family) or players.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Real-time integration and feedback</strong>: Since your QA testers and players have already expeditiously received the latest game update, there should be no delay in receiving feedback and bug reports. This is vital to promptly address your players’ needs and efficiently close the loop on iterating changes, maintaining the quality of the game in the process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Additional reading | CI/CD</p>
<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">continuous integration</strong> and <strong class="bold">continuous deployment</strong> (or <strong class="bold">delivery</strong>). It <a id="_idIndexMarker1644" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>encompasses <a id="_idIndexMarker1645" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>best practices for development teams using automated code integration and delivery.</p>

<p class="calibre3">By leveraging Unity DevOps, game developers can streamline their workflows, accelerate development cycles, and deliver higher-quality gaming experiences to their players. DevOps takes care of the production phase of your game development journey. Now, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1646" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>review Unity LiveOps, which takes care of the release phase.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-287" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor307" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Introducing Unity LiveOps</h2>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">LiveOps</strong>, derived from<a id="_idIndexMarker1647" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> the fusion of, well, <strong class="bold">live</strong> (<strong class="bold">Live</strong>) and <strong class="bold">operations</strong> (<strong class="bold">Ops</strong>) practices, also plays an important role in game development, especially in applying GaaS during the post-release phase. Unity LiveOps focuses on the activities required to run live games, such as content updates, community management, and analytics, all of which help keep your game relevant and engaging for players.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Examining the problems Unity LiveOps tools can solve will help us better understand the benefits. The service offerings tackle essential challenges for operating a live game by addressing critical aspects such as the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Optimizing player engagement</strong>: To<a id="_idIndexMarker1648" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> enhance player engagement and retention, we can employ LiveOps strategies that allow us to update game content dynamically, offer personalized player experiences, and respond to real-time analytics data to identify and reduce churn rate (that is, the number of players who leave the game and never return)</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Efficient game management</strong>: You can streamline game operations with automated event management, enable direct player communication, and rapidly iterate with A/B testing to align better with player expectations</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Monetization strategies</strong>: Unity LiveOps provides tools to analyze in-app purchases and manage in-game ads, allowing us to optimize revenue with promotions<a id="_idIndexMarker1649" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> and pricing while keeping our players happy</li>

<p class="calibre3">By implementing these essential LiveOps services into our games, we can strive for increased player engagement and satisfaction, both of which contribute to our game’s longevity. Completing our first published commercial game is only the start of our journey as career game developers. We want to enable our next game, so we should leverage all the tools at our disposal to help us get there.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, we learned how combining Unity DevOps and Unity LiveOps technologies, such as Unity Version Control and Analytics, equips game developers with the tools required<a id="_idIndexMarker1653" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> to form the backbone of a successful GaaS project. Next, we’ll learn how to configure Unity Version Control to secure our game project code and assets.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-288" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor308" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Safeguarding your investment! Source code management with Unity Version Control</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Unity Version<a id="_idIndexMarker1654" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> Control <a id="_idIndexMarker1655" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>provides a customized version control solution for Unity projects with tight editor integration. This ensures our work is protected and that for team environments, a smooth collaboration experience is provided for team members. As previously stated, in software development, including game development, version control is essential to prevent data loss and effectively resolve conflicts.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, we’ll explore the steps to implement Unity Version Control for our projects. First, we’ll break down Unity Version Control’s approach to catering the VCS experience that’s specific to programmers and artists. We’ll start with programmers.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-289" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor309" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Catering VCS for programmers</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Unity Version<a id="_idIndexMarker1656" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> Control provides<a id="_idIndexMarker1657" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> customized workflows for<a id="_idIndexMarker1658" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> artists and programmers in one repository. It offers developers the flexibility to work in centralized or distributed environments with comprehensive branching and merging capabilities. Artists and designers can use a simpler, user-friendly workspace interface<a id="_idIndexMarker1659" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> called <strong class="bold">Gluon</strong> to take advantage of intuitive file-based asset workflows that enhance their creativity.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.2</em> shows the developer-centric workspace interface, which provides programmers with every<a id="_idIndexMarker1660" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> feature<a id="_idIndexMarker1661" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> on<a id="_idIndexMarker1662" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> offer, such<a id="_idIndexMarker1663" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> as <strong class="bold">Pending Changes</strong>, <strong class="bold">Changesets</strong>, <strong class="bold">Branches</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Branch Explorer</strong>:</p>

<p class="calibre3">Next, we’ll delve into each interface’s features as we walk through setting up a new Unity project <a id="_idIndexMarker1664" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>using <a id="_idIndexMarker1665" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Unity Version<a id="_idIndexMarker1666" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> Control. But before that, we’ll look at the artist-centric workflow.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-290" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor310" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Catering VCS for artists</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Gluon is<a id="_idIndexMarker1667" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> recommended for artists who are <a id="_idIndexMarker1668" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>using <a id="_idIndexMarker1669" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Unity Version Control to streamline art production workflows. Gluon provides an easy-to-use file management interface that allows you to select specific files to work on without the need to download and manage the entire project. Additionally, Gluon enables users to lock files (across branches), ensuring exclusive access to art assets so that no one else can modify the same file simultaneously and then seamlessly submit changes back to the repository. The ability to lock and unlock assets as needed during work enables smoother collaboration within a game production team.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.3</em> shows the simplified artist-centric Gluon workspace interface, which provides artists and designers with the <strong class="bold">Workspace Explorer</strong>, <strong class="bold">Checkin Changes</strong>, <strong class="bold">Incoming Changes</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Changesets</strong> features:</p>

<p class="calibre3">Gluon <a id="_idIndexMarker1670" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>also <a id="_idIndexMarker1671" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>offers a <a id="_idIndexMarker1672" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>unique feature that benefits artists directly: it has a built-in image viewer diff tool! With it, you can compare two versions of the same file from the change history so that there’s never a question of what changes were made, when, and by whom to the art assets in our projects. A Gluon workspace alone can be used as a robust asset management platform. Gluon works well with standard image formats such as PNG and JPG but can support additional formats with preview generators (for example, by adding <strong class="bold">ImageMagick</strong> as an external preview tool to add support for over 100 additional formats).</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Gluon’s image diff tool</p>
<p class="callout">With Gluon’s image diff tool, you can view images side by side, use an “onion skin” preview, calculate differences, do a “swipe,” and even compare image properties in text format.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Not only does Unity Version Control provide all the VCS tooling for daily operations such as checking in changes (that is, committing and pushing) and uploading to a cloud repository, handling incoming changes (that is, pulling), and merging and resolving file change conflicts within its workspace, it’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1673" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>also fully compatible with the popular Git <strong class="bold">distributed version control system</strong> (<strong class="bold">DVCS</strong>). Let’s quickly look at how Unity Version <a id="_idIndexMarker1674" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Control <a id="_idIndexMarker1675" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>operates <a id="_idIndexMarker1676" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>as a Git client.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-291" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor311" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Catering VCS for Git</h2>
<p class="calibre3">For Git users, yes, Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker1677" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Version Control<a id="_idIndexMarker1678" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> also has <a id="_idIndexMarker1679" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>you covered – it also speaks the Git network protocol. It can push and pull changes directly with any remote Git<a id="_idIndexMarker1680" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> server (such<a id="_idIndexMarker1681" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> as <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong>, <strong class="bold">GitLab</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Bitbucket</strong>). The <strong class="bold">Git Sync</strong> feature, which<a id="_idIndexMarker1682" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> is implemented <a id="_idIndexMarker1683" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>in <strong class="bold">Branch Explorer</strong> (seen in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.7</em>) with a simple right-click menu, where you can choose <strong class="bold">Push/Pull</strong> | <strong class="bold">Sync with Git…</strong>, immediately turns Unity Version Control into a VCS that’s fully compatible with Git bidirectional synchronization. The advantage is that you can use Unity Version Control for all your DVCS client needs, either with a Unity Version Control workspace or a Git project.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Additional reading | Git</p>
<p class="callout">Git is a popular free and open source DVCS: <a href="https://git-scm.com/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://git-scm.com/</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, Unity Version Control is designed to manage game-specific assets quickly and efficiently, even when dealing with huge files and binaries. This makes it an effective alternative to Git, especially <a id="_idIndexMarker1684" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Git <strong class="bold">large file support</strong> (<strong class="bold">LFS</strong>), which is known for its tendency to have issues. Whether your game assets are large or small, Unity Version Control offers a fast and efficient way to manage them all in your game projects.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Okay, enough on practices and workflows – let’s set up our first Unity Version Control cloud workspace<a id="_idIndexMarker1685" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> for a new Unity project.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-292" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor312" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Setting up Unity Version Control</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Unity has made<a id="_idIndexMarker1686" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> adding version control to your projects as frictionless as possible by adding an option directly in the <strong class="bold">Unity Hub</strong> interface when creating a new project. You simply need to select a checkbox, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.4</em>. Use Unity Version Control? Check – yes, please!</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.4 – Unity Hub showing a new version-controlled project</p>
<p class="calibre3">When creating a project in Unity Hub, referring to <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.4</em>, we must create and link a version control workspace by following these steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">Open <strong class="bold">Unity Hub</strong> and click the <strong class="bold">New Project</strong> button (top-right of the window).</li>
<li class="calibre15">Select a template on which to base your new project (download the template if required).</li>
<li class="calibre15">Now, under the <strong class="bold">PROJECT SETTINGS</strong> section (right-hand side of the window), fill out the required fields:<ul class="calibre22"><li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Project name</strong>: The name you’ll assign this project (something like “my awesome game” – no special characters).</li><li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Location</strong>: Where you’ll store the project files on your local system drive (use a short path and no special characters).</li><li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Unity Cloud Organization</strong>: You must select an organization for your project.</li><li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Connect to Unity Cloud</strong>: Optional; enable this option if you intend to use UGS with this project (considering we already discussed all the benefits of UGS, we’d be doing ourselves a disservice if we don’t enable it).</li><li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Use Unity Version Control</strong>: Finally, here we are. This is optional, but we should surely enable this option for our “my awesome game” project so that we don’t lose any of our development work!</li></ul></li>
<li class="calibre15">Click <strong class="bold">Create project</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Let Unity do its<a id="_idIndexMarker1687" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> thing, creating the project and Unity Version Control workspace locally and in Unity Cloud. When Unity Editor opens, we’ll be greeted by the <strong class="bold">Unity Version Control</strong> window. As we can see, we already have some pending file changes to check in:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.5 – Unity Editor’s Unity Version Control window" src="img/B18347_15_05.jpg" class="calibre39"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.5 – Unity Editor’s Unity Version Control window</p>
<p class="calibre3">At any time, if you need the <strong class="bold">Unity Version Control</strong> window because it’s not currently showing, go to <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Unity Version Control</strong> or click the button to the right of the <em class="italic">Manage services</em> (cloud icon) button (top left, directly under the file menu).</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">You can also quickly use the standalone Unity Version Control desktop application, shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, by clicking the gear icon and selecting <strong class="bold">Open in </strong><strong class="bold">Desktop App</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As seen in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, these files are the default assets Unity adds to a new project. They only exist locally in our project folder, so we need to inform the Unity Version Control workspace that we have these changes to track. We can do that by using the <strong class="bold">Pending Changes</strong> tab, confirming the files we want selected, and checking in the changes (or, in Git terms, <strong class="bold">commit</strong>).</p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Initial commit</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1688" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>common first commit message for a changeset, meaning this is the beginning of our workspace, or repository, history, so enter that in the text box provided at the bottom. Check the check box next to <strong class="bold">Added and private</strong> because we want all these files, too, then click <strong class="bold">Check in Changes</strong>. This will create a changeset and a file version <a id="_idIndexMarker1689" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>history for all the files in the changeset. Yay! You’ve just made your first VCS commit!</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Committing best practices</p>
<p class="callout">Commit small, commit often. Or, at the very least, commit at the end of your workday to ensure no work progress is lost. It’s also good to test your work before committing and use a clear and concise commit message (for example, include why the change was made, not just what was changed).</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Unity Cloud dashboard also provides a browser-based interface for managing Unity Version Control repositories. It allows users to visualize and interface with their project’s version history, branches, changesets, code reviews, and file locks. Seats and user groups are also available for team management, and usage reporting is available for tracking billing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can view your game project’s cloud repository by opening Unity Cloud in your browser (<a href="http://cloud.unity.com" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">http://cloud.unity.com</a>) and going to <strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> | <strong class="bold">Repositories</strong>:</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.6 – Unity Cloud repositories dashboard</p>
<p class="calibre3">The VCS workflow is very simple and straightforward for a solo developer. You are the only person making changes, and you’ll rarely, if ever, conflict with yourself while performing daily work in your solo-member workspace.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Pulling best practices</p>
<p class="callout">A common best practice for project teams is to regularly update their working copy by pulling the latest changes from the cloud repository to work from before starting new work or making further changes. That way, the team always builds upon moving the project code base forward.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You may, however, want to revert some changes to an earlier version. So, for those situations and if <a id="_idIndexMarker1690" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>you’re working with a team of developers in the same workspace, we must consider some best practices for setting up a Unity project for collaboration to minimize file merge conflicts.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Setting up a collaborative project structure</h3>
<p class="calibre3">When setting up <a id="_idIndexMarker1691" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>a Unity project for version control, adopting a project architecture designed for better collaboration is essential to help prevent workflow conflicts between team members. A well-organized project structure and clear guidelines for scene organization and prefab workflows can significantly reduce the likelihood of conflicts and problematic merge issues that are often encountered with Unity scene and Prefabs assets and any binary files that cannot merge.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Project organization and VCS best practices eBook (Unity)</p>
<p class="callout">Version control and project organization best practices for game developers: <a href="https://unity.com/resources/version-control-project-organization-best-practices-ebook" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://unity.com/resources/version-control-project-organization-best-practices-ebook</a></p>
<p class="calibre3">The two aspects for better project structure that we touched on previously, namely Prefabs and scenes, deserve a bit more context, so let’s have a quick look at them:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Prefab workflow</strong>: Prefab workflows are crucial for efficient collaboration in Unity projects. Prefabs allow for modular game design, where game objects are pre-made objects that form the Scene Hierarchy and are put together to create all the necessary functionality. Prefab changes are carefully managed and communicated to minimize conflicts and ensure consistency. Still, they are updated separately from scene changes to prevent unintentional simultaneous scene updates by multiple team members.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Additive scene workflow</strong>: When it comes to managing scenes in Unity, it’s important to have collaborative workflows and organization strategies in place. Using an additive scene approach allows multiple developers to work on different aspects of the same level simultaneously by sectioning a level into main scenes and additive scenes (such as lighting, gameplay elements, or UI components); teams can work on different scenes in parallel and bring them together at runtime without conflicts. Additionally, ensure that Unity’s scene serialization is used in text mode (the default for version control) to make it easier for VCS to track changes and use merge tools such as <strong class="bold">UnityYAMLMerge</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">In addition to these Unity project-specific collaborative workflows, we can also use VCS team workflows, such as <em class="italic">branch per feature</em> or even <em class="italic">branch </em><em class="italic">per task</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When developing new features or working on specific project tasks, it’s often helpful for teams to work in isolated branches rather than use a single main (or master) branch. This approach facilitates collaboration by allowing each feature to progress on its own timeline, reducing conflicts and enabling parallel development among the team. As a result, team workflow is smoother, and project management becomes more organized.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Git Flow</p>
<p class="callout">In Git, <strong class="bold">Git Flow</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1692" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>workflow that employs different branches for features, bug fixes, and releases.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.7</em>, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1693" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>can see how Unity Version Control visualizes the workspace branches. Additional branches will show up as forked from the changeset of the source branch:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.7 – Unity Version Control branch explorer with changesets" src="img/B18347_15_07.jpg" class="calibre174"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.7 – Unity Version Control branch explorer with changesets</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Pull request (PR) | code review</p>
<p class="callout">After completing work on a feature branch, it’s a good practice to create a <strong class="bold">pull request</strong> (<strong class="bold">PR</strong>) to<a id="_idIndexMarker1694" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> merge the changes into the dev/develop branch (before merging into the main branch for distribution). The team leader or a designated senior developer on the DevOps team should review the changes before accepting and merging the request.</p>
<p class="callout">In Unity Version Control, we don’t have PRs per se (it’s a Git concept). Instead, we have a whole code review system: <a href="https://docs.plasticscm.com/code-review" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://docs.plasticscm.com/code-review</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once work has been completed on a features branch, using a PR or code review process is good practice to merge the work into the Dev (develop) branch. It’s the responsibility of the team leader or designated senior developer on the DevOps team to review before accepting and merging the request.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the end of the day, what matters most is that you – or your development team – feel at ease with the VCS workflow. However, it’s not always possible to avoid merge conflicts, no matter how strictly we adhere to the best workflow practices and collaboration <a id="_idIndexMarker1695" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>strategies. So, when faced with the inevitable task of resolving merge conflicts, we rely on merge tools to help us through.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Merging conflicting file changes</h3>
<p class="calibre3">Unity Version Control<a id="_idIndexMarker1696" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> comes with a powerful merge tool and merge configuration settings designed specifically for handling merges in Unity projects. The merge configuration allows us to specify asset-specific merge tools<a id="_idIndexMarker1697" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> such as <strong class="bold">UnityYAMLMerge</strong> for Unity scene files and <strong class="bold">Semantic Merge</strong> for most other text-based file assets:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">UnityYAMLMerge</strong>: A merge tool that’s specific for merging scene and prefab files in YAML format. It understands the structure of Unity-specific assets, making it more intelligent than text-based merge tools. It is an invaluable asset for teams working on Unity projects, and Unity Version Control’s default configuration includes it.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Semantic Merge</strong>: An intelligent<a id="_idIndexMarker1698" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> C# language-dependent merge tool that can resolve code conflicts efficiently, mostly automatically, because it understands code structure beyond simple text differences.</li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Viewing file history and differences</p>
<p class="callout">You can right-click on any script or asset at any time in the Unity Editor’s <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window and select <strong class="bold">Unity Version Control</strong> | <strong class="bold">View </strong><strong class="bold">file history</strong>.</p>
<p class="callout">Alternatively, you can select <strong class="bold">Unity Version Control</strong> | <strong class="bold">Diff with previous revision</strong> to see file-specific changes between the two.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I hope I have convinced you of the value of using the Unity version control system in your game project – or any VCS. We learned how to set up Unity Version Control for a new Unity project, the basics of checking in our work, and some best practices for organizing our project for team collaboration.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In the next section, we’ll continue our discussion for preparing our games for commercial release with an overview of an in-game economy.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-293" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor313" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Engaging players with an in-game economy</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In-game economies <a id="_idIndexMarker1700" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>are critical for commercial success and warrant our attention when designing our games. Different monetization mechanisms, when designing our game mechanics, play a significant role in our ability to generate revenue within the game, which is distinct from commercialization efforts such as marketing and distribution.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Economy mechanisms can cover a wide range of strategies and differ, sometimes drastically, between game platforms and genres. These strategies can include microtransactions, ads, virtual currencies, subscription models, or premium game purchases. By understanding a few basic nuances between these mechanisms, game producers and developers can gain an understanding of effective commercial strategies for their games.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Commercialization versus monetization</p>
<p class="callout">The distinction between<a id="_idIndexMarker1701" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> commercialization<a id="_idIndexMarker1702" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> and monetization lies in their respective focuses. Commercialization is primarily concerned with bringing a game to market and making it available to players, while monetization deals with how the game generates revenue once it’s in players’ hands.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Producers have two primary platforms to choose from when launching commercial games, and how game economies are structured varies significantly between them. These are <strong class="bold">mobile</strong> and <strong class="bold">PC</strong> – we could even say “free” and premium.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, let’s quickly look at what each platform’s economic strategy is designed to do, starting <a id="_idIndexMarker1703" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>with mobile.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-294" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor314" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Economies for mobile games</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Mobile games <a id="_idIndexMarker1704" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>often follow a “freemium” or <strong class="bold">free-to-play</strong> (<strong class="bold">F2P</strong>) model, which means they are available for players to <a id="_idIndexMarker1705" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>download and play without any up-front payment. However, the monetization strategy includes buying virtual currency for in-game items, watching ads, or paying microtransactions to obtain different gameplay advantages. Unsurprisingly, this model is designed to attract a wide range of players to download and play the game, meaning your game has to be remarkable and fun to be successful since most mobile games only earn from a small fraction of their players (churn is real – players need to find the fun fast!).</p>
<p class="calibre3">To get the most out of a commercial game release on mobile, here are some key strategies you can focus on in your game design:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Encourage regular player engagement</strong>: Mobile game developers commonly use daily login rewards, quests, events, timers, speed-ups, and even weekly or monthly challenges to encourage players to return to the game regularly with the ultimate goal of getting players to buy.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Rewarded ad watch</strong>: One way of generating ad revenue is by offering rewards to players in exchange for watching the entire ad. Rewards can speed up gameplay progress, double virtual currency rewards, or even save the player’s progress. You get the ad revenue but also lead the player down a path to buying later on.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">In-game purchase offers</strong>: Cosmetic items to gameplay advantages are on offer here. However, it’s crucial to balance gameplay advantages to avoid “pay-to-win” scenarios, which can tend to drive players away.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Subscriptions and season passes</strong>: Providing unique content for a limited time – evoking a sense of urgency and excitement – can motivate players to keep coming back and engage them to keep spending on your game.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">It’s not an extensive list by any means, and implementing these strategies in your games’ monetization mechanics requires a lot of subtlety. Still, it would be best to have a general sense of what’s needed to introduce an in-game economy for your mobile game’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1706" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>commercial potential.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next, we’ll examine similar strategies for premium games.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-295" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor315" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Economies for premium games</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Premium games, which <a id="_idIndexMarker1707" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>are purchased upfront and only offer a <em class="italic">free</em> play experience if the publisher provides a demo, focus more on the player’s initial investment but may include additional incentives for revenue longevity. To contradict a bit of what I just said, though, some titles are F2P but monetize purely through in-game purchases and expansion packs. As such, the premium game economy differs significantly from mobile games.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here are some key strategies you can focus on in your game design to get the most out of a commercial game release on PC:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Expansion packs and downloadable content (DLC)</strong>: To extend the life cycle and longevity of premium games, new stories and content can be purchased by players after their initial release to generate additional revenue. It’s best to account for DLC during the development phase because the game architecture must support it.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">In-game purchase offers</strong>: This one crosses over from mobile since we also include cosmetic items and gameplay advantages here. You don’t need to look any further than the free-to-play <strong class="bold">Fortnite</strong> to know how much revenue can be generated from cosmetic items! Again, here, it’s important to balance gameplay advantages to avoid “pay-to-win” scenarios – I believe the PC crowd is more inclined to be driven away here.</li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">The game’s initial quality and depth = player trust</strong>: Premium games should offer gameplay experiences that justify the price tag to the player (that is, the feeling that what they paid for the game is worthwhile). So, in this case, the game’s economy should focus on enriching the player experience and not so much on encouraging more player spending, which is a difficult balance to strike when we try to ensure our investment in making the game is positive from a revenue perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">This is also not an extensive list, with the obvious subtleties required to implement these strategies being left to your creative mind while we wear our economist hat. However, it’s still a good sense of what’s needed to bring in-game economies for a premium game’s commercial potential.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s finish our<a id="_idIndexMarker1708" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> introduction to the in-game economy by examining the contrasting strategies and mechanisms of the mobile and PC platforms.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-296" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor316" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Contrasting economic strategies</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The platforms we’ve<a id="_idIndexMarker1709" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> discussed regarding the in-game economy each have distinct approaches to engaging players and generating the resulting revenue (hopefully). To better understand the differences in the strategies laid out for each one, we can simply and clearly compare the key strategies.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The following matrix table shows the primary differences between each platform’s in-game economy strategy and associated player engagement:</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 15.1 – In-game economy contrast between mobile and PC games</p>
<p class="calibre3">Creating an in-game economy is a delicate task that requires many disciplines, including a mashup of gameplay design and fair monetization strategies. For mobile games, the challenge lies in attracting and then engaging a small percentage of players to convince them to spend real money on an otherwise free experience. And for premium PC games, the challenge lies initially in offering enough upfront value to players that they’ll gladly justify purchasing your game. Then, it’s up to you to engage them to want to spend more for additional content. Both economies require a thorough understanding of your target player demographic and your ability to avoid introducing undesirable monetization approaches.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, you learned the basics of an in-game economy for mobile and PC platforms. Of course, a lot more can be learned here, so I encourage you to do additional reading on the topics that appeal most to your game’s design. As it would happen, Unity<a id="_idIndexMarker1710" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> provides best practices and guides on the subject too!</p>
<p class="callout-heading">What is an in-game economy | Unity</p>
<p class="callout">The first guide in a series about the in-game economy: <a href="https://unity.com/how-to/what-is-in-game-economy-guide-part-1" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://unity.com/how-to/what-is-in-game-economy-guide-part-1</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next section, we’ll explore the platform distribution aspect of a game production’s life cycle.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-297" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor317" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Getting your game out there! Platform distribution</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In the previous section, we talked about the mobile and PC platforms concerning the in-game economies. However, we did not go into detail about distributing to these platforms. Well, now’s the time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, we’ll examine the options available for distributing our games on mobile and PC platforms. This will be a high-level review of the processes, with a focus geared more toward commercial releases. I’ll also provide links for each platform for the – in most cases – step-by-step details of preparing our game for distribution on that platform.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Console distribution</p>
<p class="callout">For console distribution platforms <a id="_idIndexMarker1711" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>such <a id="_idIndexMarker1712" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>as <strong class="bold">PlayStation</strong>, <strong class="bold">Xbox</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Nintendo Switch</strong>, a game <a id="_idIndexMarker1713" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>developer – who is not associated with a large AAA studio – will face additional challenges regarding these platforms. The additional set of requirements for getting our games on consoles generally involves such things as a rigorous approval process, purchase of a costly developer’s kit, a lengthy and complicated code porting process, and conforming to specific standards and performance requirements.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Starting with mobile, let’s discover what’s available to get our game into players’ hands.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-298" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor318" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Distributing on mobile platforms</h2>
<p class="calibre3">In the world <a id="_idIndexMarker1714" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>of mobile game distribution, there are two key players to be aware of – let’s face it, most people old enough to buy a smartphone or tablet device <a id="_idIndexMarker1715" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>know what they are – the <strong class="bold">Google Play Store</strong> and <a id="_idIndexMarker1716" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>the <strong class="bold">Apple </strong><strong class="bold">App Store</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">These mobile-centric platforms, or storefronts, offer developers access to a vast global audience without much friction in accessing the platform and building our games – especially when using Unity. However, developers are challenged with standing out in a crowded marketplace and competing with large studios (and large marketing budgets!), so it’s critical to optimize for discoverability with not only a remarkable game but also learning the ins and <a id="_idIndexMarker1717" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>outs of <strong class="bold">app store </strong><strong class="bold">optimization</strong> (<strong class="bold">ASO</strong>).</p>
<p class="calibre3">The free-to-play model is king on mobile storefronts since it’s what the storefronts provide significant support for and is generally what players still expect. As mentioned in the previous section, <em class="italic">Engaging players with an in-game economy</em>, and aligning with player expectations, we’ll want to consider the platform’s built-in payment systems for in-app purchases <a id="_idIndexMarker1718" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>and ads for revenue.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s start with an overview of the publishing requirements for the Google Play Store.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Publishing on the Google Play Store</h3>
<p class="calibre3">Developers looking<a id="_idIndexMarker1719" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> to publish their <a id="_idIndexMarker1720" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>games on the Google Play Store must understand both the technical and financial aspects of the platform – this is true not only for the Google Play Store but also for any of the distribution platforms available to us.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Considering the technical aspects, publishing to the Google Play Store means building our games for the <strong class="bold">Android</strong> platform. Unity offers great support building for Android and provides many settings for customizing the game builds (such as a graphics API, texture compression, quality settings, and a scripting backend). In addition, Unity provides scripting API access to mobile-specific device features such as touch input, camera, vibration, gyroscope and accelerometer, location services, notifications, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1721" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>AR support (<strong class="bold">ARCore</strong>).</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Android screen resolutions</p>
<p class="callout">Adapting games for Android devices poses a significant challenge to mobile developers because of the eye-widening number of screen resolutions, aspect ratios, display notches and cutouts, and now foldables out in the wild west of device manufacturers. This requires the game developer to put on their UI designer hat and implement responsive and flexible UI design strategies to ensure an optimal viewing experience within the screens’ safe areas across devices.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Each distribution platform generally offers a unique set of value-added services specific to its platform that developers can incorporate into their game designs. Google offers its <strong class="bold">Google Play Games Services</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker1722" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> include sign-in, saved games, achievements, leaderboards, friends, player stats, and events.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Google Play Store | distribution information</p>
<p class="callout">Release with confidence: <a href="https://play.google.com/console/about/guides/releasewithconfidence/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://play.google.com/console/about/guides/releasewithconfidence/</a></p>
<p class="calibre3">Now, let’s review<a id="_idIndexMarker1723" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> the publishing<a id="_idIndexMarker1724" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> requirements for the Apple App Store.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Publishing on the Apple App Store</h3>
<p class="calibre3">Developers<a id="_idIndexMarker1725" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> looking to publish their<a id="_idIndexMarker1726" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> games on the Apple App Store must understand that it has its own technical and financial aspects for distributing games on the platform. Again, this is something true for all platforms.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When looking to publish games to the Apple App Store, the technical aspects involve building our games for the <strong class="bold">iOS</strong> platform. Unity has us covered here, too, and offers excellent support for building<a id="_idIndexMarker1727" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> iOS <strong class="bold">Xcode</strong> projects. Correct – I didn’t say game build. Unity generates an Xcode project to build iOS apps and games, so if you want to build a game locally, you must have Xcode installed – it’s only available on <strong class="bold">macOS</strong> systems. However, Unity<a id="_idIndexMarker1728" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> Build Automation, which we already know from the <em class="italic">Introducing Unity DevOps</em> section, can build and deploy iOS games for you, making it possible to develop an iOS application on non-macOS systems.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Additional reading | Unity documentation</p>
<p class="callout">Build for iOS: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/iphone-BuildProcess.xhtml" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/iphone-BuildProcess.xhtml</a></p>
<p class="calibre3">Unsurprisingly, Unity also provides scripting API access for iOS device-specific features such as touch input, camera, vibration, gyroscope and accelerometer, location services, notifications, and AR <a id="_idIndexMarker1729" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>support (<strong class="bold">ARKit</strong>).</p>
<p class="callout-heading">iOS screen resolutions</p>
<p class="callout">In contrast to Android, the iOS device ecosystem offers a more consistent range of screen resolutions, aspect ratios, and “notched” safe areas to display game content and UI within. Apple’s well-controlled hardware designs also mean there are fewer device models, each with its well-documented screen specifications. This uniformity simplifies game development as we wear our UI-designer hats to ensure our games are presented more seamlessly across Apple’s mobile devices.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Apple also offers a range of value-added services specific to its platforms that developers can incorporate into their game designs. Apple offers <strong class="bold">Game Center</strong>, which can be utilized for games targeting <strong class="bold">Apple Arcade</strong>. The following services are available: player identity, saved games, leaderboards, achievements, and turn-based and multiplayer games.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Apple App Store | distribution information</p>
<p class="callout">Submit your iOS apps to the App Store: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Additional <a id="_idIndexMarker1730" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>third-party <a id="_idIndexMarker1731" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>app stores are available for<a id="_idIndexMarker1732" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> Android and target smaller but more direct markets, such as <strong class="bold">Amazon Appstore</strong>, <strong class="bold">Samsung Galaxy Store</strong>, <strong class="bold">Huawei AppGallery</strong>, and <strong class="bold">APPTUTTi</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Unity Distribution Portal</strong> (<a href="https://api-udp.unity.com/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://api-udp.unity.com/</a>) attempts to simplify the process<a id="_idIndexMarker1733" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> of releasing and managing our Android game releases to multiple global app stores, so that may be of interest. But there are (currently) no such third-party app store markets for iOS.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s finish up the<a id="_idIndexMarker1734" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> mobile <a id="_idIndexMarker1735" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>distribution platforms with a quick breakdown of the financial considerations.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Publishing financials</h3>
<p class="calibre3">For the financial<a id="_idIndexMarker1736" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> aspect, I’ve compiled the essential publishing information for developers interested in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store platforms in the following table:</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 15.2 – Mobile store publishing details</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note regarding Table 15.2</p>
<p class="callout">*I’ve greatly simplified this statement because it’s constantly evolving; please consult the platform documentation for current information. In some situations, the revenue fee is lowered to 15%.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That covers mobile-specific distribution platforms, so let’s move on to PC-based platforms and<a id="_idIndexMarker1737" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> explore some of their specific requirements.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-299" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor319" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Distributing on PC platforms</h2>
<p class="calibre3">PC games <a id="_idIndexMarker1738" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>have a wider range of distribution options for both commercial sale of and non-commercial sharing of our games. For mobile games, the distribution is purely digital delivery, whereas PC games can have physical distribution channels, too, but we’ll focus only on digital storefronts.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Steam</strong> and <strong class="bold">Epic Games Store</strong> are the two primary parties involved in the PC-based game digital storefronts. The primary commercialization strategy for these storefronts is premium. Generally speaking, PC-based players usually seek more immersive gameplay experiences than mobile offers, which aligns more with the premium model’s focus on upfront purchases or subscriptions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, just as much as with mobile storefronts, developers launching on PC game distribution platforms must maximize visibility, navigate channels, and leverage platform-specific features to entice players, enhance their engagement, and, of course, drive sales.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Direct sales</p>
<p class="callout">Game developers can offer their games directly to players from their websites as an alternative to PC game storefronts. This approach provides higher revenue per sale and complete control over the sales process but does require significant effort and investment in marketing, customer service, and infrastructure. Do you want to make games and get them in players’ hands or manage an eCommerce website?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s dive into each of these primary PC game storefronts now, with similar coverage to the mobile storefronts, and finish with <strong class="bold">Itch.io</strong>, which caters more to smaller independent game <a id="_idIndexMarker1739" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>developers for both premium, donation-based, or completely free game distribution.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Publishing on Steam</h3>
<p class="calibre3">It should be no <a id="_idIndexMarker1740" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>surprise that developers <a id="_idIndexMarker1741" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>looking to publish their PC games on Steam must also navigate and understand this platform’s technical and financial aspects.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Considering the technical aspects, publishing to Steam means building our games for standalone PC platforms, but primarily Windows (Mac and Linux are also supported). Before being able to publish our Unity games on Steam, we first need to integrate the <strong class="bold">Steamworks software developer kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDK</strong>). The SDK provides all the necessary tools and <a id="_idIndexMarker1742" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>resources to ensure compatibility with the Steam distribution platform (including such essential things as setting our<a id="_idIndexMarker1743" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> Steam <strong class="bold">App ID</strong>). Games must also meet specific technical requirements set by the platform. These requirements include such things as minimum system specifications, controller support, and game performance.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Like what mobile platforms provide, PC platforms also have unique services that add value to our games! For Steam, we have a full breadth of services available to integrate into our games, including achievements, game statistics, leaderboards, OpenID, game notifications, voice chat and commands, input, player-created content, inventory, microtransactions, game servers, and matchmaking and lobbies for multiplayer.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Steam | distribution information</p>
<p class="callout">See what Steamworks has to offer: <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://partner.steamgames.com/</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now, let’s look at the<a id="_idIndexMarker1744" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> other side of the coin for PC <a id="_idIndexMarker1745" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>game distribution platforms, the Epic Games Store.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Publishing on the Epic Games Store</h3>
<p class="calibre3">Developers <a id="_idIndexMarker1746" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>who want to distribute their PC games <a id="_idIndexMarker1747" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>on the <strong class="bold">Epic Games Store</strong> (<strong class="bold">Epic</strong>) face the same familiar platform technical and financial aspects. Let’s review them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The technical aspects are up first; publishing to Epic means building our games for standalone PC platforms, which Epic supports for Windows and Mac. Unlike Steam, Epic does not require us to integrate any specific platform SDKs, but games still must meet the particular technical requirements set by the platform. The requirements are designed to provide the best gameplay experiences and, surprisingly, not lock players into a single storefront. The requirements include supporting crossplay for multiplayer games across any PC storefront, implementing achievements for Epic if implemented in other stores’ distributions, and ensuring games download, install, launch, and function consistently – while also being of sufficient quality.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That’s not to say that Epic doesn’t offer gaming services similar to Steam – they provide a dizzying array of online<a id="_idIndexMarker1748" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> services. <strong class="bold">Epic Online Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">EOS</strong>) has built-in support for all kinds of platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Android, and iOS. The services on offer for both account and game services include achievements, gameplay stats, leaderboards, login, player accounts and data storage, title storage, player management, friends, presence, game invites, voice chat, analytics, anti-cheat, and multiplayer services with crossplay, peer-to-peer, matchmaking, and lobbies. Whew! Mind you, they all are entirely free to use.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Why is Epic providing free online game services?</p>
<p class="callout">Scaling a game and strengthening player communities requires various backend services and infrastructure; finishing our games is only half the battle. Epic offers help for game developers to succeed with their games by providing services – initially made for Fortnite and currently operating the Epic Games Store – for free for all developers. The sentiment from Epic is that they succeed when, through widespread adoption of their services, the participating developers succeed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Epic has also recently started allowing indie game developers to self-publish on their store through<a id="_idIndexMarker1749" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> the <strong class="bold">Epic Developer Portal</strong>, stating that the store is open to all developers and game publishers, so long as their games meet the store’s requirements.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Epic Games | distribution information</p>
<p class="callout">Start distributing PC games on the Epic Games Store: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/distribution" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/distribution</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In addition to self-publishing as a differentiating factor, Epic Games Store is also known for exclusivity deals, regular free game giveaways, grant awards, and support for blockchain-based games (wading into a more controversial side of game development).</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Web3 (blockchain) games</p>
<p class="callout">The Epic Games Store is one of the only leading storefronts to embrace blockchain technology games. Blockchain, NFT, and cryptocurrency products can be published but only if they follow specific policies: <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/distribution-requirements/blockchain" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/distribution-requirements/blockchain</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Transitioning from the leading PC distribution platform storefronts to a more indie-friendly distribution platform is a pivot away from purely commercial revenue generation aspirations. Let’s have a look at how more indie-friendly platforms, such as Itch.io<a id="_idIndexMarker1750" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> and <strong class="bold">Game Jolt</strong>, prioritize<a id="_idIndexMarker1751" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> creative<a id="_idIndexMarker1752" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> freedom and a more experimental space for game developers to share their game creations with the world.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Publishing on Itch.io</h3>
<p class="calibre3">In the landscape <a id="_idIndexMarker1753" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>of digital distribution platform<a id="_idIndexMarker1754" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> storefronts, Itch.io stands apart. The platform distinctly caters to indie game developers and creatives. That’s not to say it’s not home to some well-known and popular titles such as <em class="italic">Celeste</em>, <em class="italic">Night in the Woods</em>, and <em class="italic">Doki Doki Literature Club!</em> (for you visual novel fans). The platform offers a unique opportunity for game publishers to start small and scale up as their games grow.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The technical aspects of the platform are pretty open because the type of platforms supported varies, depending on the kind of game being distributed via Unity or literally any other game engine or coding framework. The platform supports<a id="_idIndexMarker1755" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> playing <code>*.zip</code> and <code>*.rar</code> files), as well as media files (that is, image, audio, and video files).</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Itch.io | Distribution information</p>
<p class="callout">Create a custom page to instantly distribute or sell your indie games: <a href="https://itch.io/developers" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://itch.io/developers</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Regarding the financial aspect, Itch.io allows sellers to determine the revenue percentage share to Itch.io, ranging from 0% to 100%, with a default rate of 10% if you don’t make any changes to it. Yay!</p>

<p class="calibre3">As a side note, for Unity developers just looking to quickly share their games (usually early prototypes or<a id="_idIndexMarker1756" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> development in progress for testing), the <strong class="bold">SIMMER.io</strong> website <a id="_idIndexMarker1757" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>provides drag-and-drop simplicity for quickly sharing WebGL game builds. I believe a “tip jar” is in the works.</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 15.3 – Steam publishing details</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note regarding Table 15.3</p>
<p class="callout">*I’ve greatly simplified this statement because it’s constantly evolving; please consult the platform documentation for current information.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, we learned about the larger game distribution platforms for mobile and PC. We explored the technical and financial aspects of publishing games on these storefronts and looked at what distinct services they offer for integrating into our game’s design.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next, we’ll walk through an example implementation of UGS and publish the game to a PC-based store<a id="_idIndexMarker1760" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> platform.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-300" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor320" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Implementing UGS and publishing</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker1761" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>have a foundational knowledge of Unity’s cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker1762" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> services for DevOps and LiveOps, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1763" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>walk through an example of adding base LiveOps analytics and crash reporting to a project and implementing a basic player engagement strategy by updating game content dynamically. We’ll finish up by automating our build process with DevOps.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We’ll start by adding the LiveOps services to our game project. For this example, and as seen in this chapter’s screenshots, I’ll use the 2D collection game we started with in <a href="B18347_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>. To follow along, you’ll either need to have made a game based on that project, or you can download the Unity project from this book’s GitHub repository here: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unity-2022-by-Example/tree/main/ch2/Unity%20Project" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unity-2022-by-Example/tree/main/ch2/Unity%20Project</a>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-301" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor321" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Adding LiveOps services</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The two services <a id="_idIndexMarker1764" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>we’ll be adding to our <a id="_idIndexMarker1765" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>game project are <strong class="bold">Analytics</strong> and <strong class="bold">Cloud Diagnostics</strong>. These services are the most basic activities required to run live games successfully, and I wouldn’t publish a game without them! We can easily understand how our game is performing with our players, and Unity’s providing these services out-of-the-box is a definite plus.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Both services are available to add and enable directly within the Unity Editor. Let’s start by adding the Analytics service.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Adding Analytics</h3>
<p class="calibre3">The Unity Analytics <a id="_idIndexMarker1766" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>service collects essential data about your game and players. Core game events and user properties are automatically collected when a player opens and runs your game. Additionally, you can define and track your custom in-game events. All the data that’s collected from the player activity is aggregated and displayed in the Unity Cloud dashboard, which allows you, or any team member, to analyze the data and gain insights related to player engagement. Analytics is invaluable in determining how to optimize your game for increased player retention and satisfaction.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Additional reading | Unity documentation</p>
<p class="callout">Deep data insights about your game: <a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-analytics" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://unity.com/products/unity-analytics</a>.</p>
<p class="callout">Get started with Analytics: <a href="https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/analytics/manual/get-started" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/analytics/manual/get-started</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Luckily, it’s easy to quickly add to our games by following these steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">Open <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">In the <strong class="bold">Packages</strong> dropdown, change the context to <strong class="bold">Unity Registry</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Search for <code>analytics</code>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Select <strong class="bold">Analytics</strong> and click the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Once installed, click the <strong class="bold">Configure</strong> button.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Click the <strong class="bold">Go to Dashboard</strong> link to open the Unity Cloud dashboard (in your default web browser) to configure and monitor events and get an overview of your game’s activity in <strong class="bold">Game performance</strong>, drill down into critical metrics with <strong class="bold">Data Explorer</strong>, and see how events change over time with <strong class="bold">Event Browser.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Initializing the Analytics service</p>
<p class="callout">To start collecting player data to be shown and analyzed in the Unity Cloud dashboard, we’ll have to do two things for the Analytics service. First, we need to call <strong class="source-inline1">UnityServices.InitializeAsync()</strong> when the game starts. More importantly, due to data privacy regulations (such as GDPR, CCPA, or PIPL), we’ll also need to have the player opt into having data collected so that we can call <strong class="source-inline1">StartDataCollection()</strong>.</p>
<p class="callout">You can find detailed information on how to perform this initial setup here: <a href="https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/analytics/manual/sdk-guide" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/analytics/manual/sdk-guide</a>.</p>
<p class="callout">I’ve provided a basic analytics initialization script example for you to get started with here: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unity-2022-by-Example/tree/main/ch15/Game-Assets/AnalyticsInitialization.zip" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unity-2022-by-Example/tree/main/ch15/Game-Assets/AnalyticsInitialization.zip</a>.</p>
<p class="callout">Make opting in a positive experience for your players by using a statement like the following: “<em class="italic">Help us create a better game experience for you! Opting into analytics lets us learn how you play the game and what we can improve. We take your privacy seriously; all data is collected anonymously and used solely to enhance gameplay and features. Thank you for your support!</em>” (Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer; you should consult accordingly when it comes to regulations.)</p>
<p class="calibre3">Adding our <a id="_idIndexMarker1767" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>next LiveOps service will be even easier.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Adding Cloud Diagnostics</h3>
<p class="calibre3">The most essential <a id="_idIndexMarker1768" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>service that’s included under Cloud Diagnostics is, by far, <strong class="bold">Crash and Exception Reporting</strong>. When your game is<a id="_idIndexMarker1769" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> out in the wild with players banging on it, it is incredibly challenging to know what’s going on with its operational stability. You can get real-time data on crashes and exceptions in your games by simply adding and enabling the service in your project from Unity Editor. Then, you can periodically view any occurrences with their crash and exception details (including stack trace) to take action on.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To add Cloud Diagnostics to your project, follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">Open <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">In the <strong class="bold">Packages</strong> dropdown, change the context to <strong class="bold">Unity Registry</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Search for <code>diagnostics</code>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Select <strong class="bold">Cloud Diagnostics</strong> and click the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Once installed, click the <strong class="bold">Configure</strong> button (or, at any time, go to <strong class="bold">Services</strong> | <strong class="bold">Cloud Diagnostics</strong> | <strong class="bold">Configure</strong>).</li>
<li class="calibre15">Click the slider in the top-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> window to enable Cloud Diagnostics.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Click the <strong class="bold">Go to Dashboard</strong> link to open the Unity Cloud dashboard (in your default web browser) to monitor and review any crash occurrences in Crash and Exception Reporting.</li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Additional reading | Unity documentation</p>
<p class="callout">Setting up Cloud Diagnostics: <a href="https://unity.com/products/cloud-diagnostics" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://unity.com/products/cloud-diagnostics</a></p>

<p class="calibre3">To test our<a id="_idIndexMarker1770" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> configuration of the Cloud Diagnostics service, we can use a <code>Debug.LogException()</code> statement to view an exception message within the Console window in the <code>Start()</code> method of any script added to a GameObject in your scene and enter <strong class="bold">Play Mode</strong>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
Debug.LogException(
    new System.Exception(("Cloud diagnostics test!")));</pre> <p class="calibre3">To finish our LiveOps example, let’s see how we can dynamically change game content by adding a seasonal holiday theme to our ladybug player character for Halloween.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-302" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor322" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Updating game content dynamically</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The autumn <a id="_idIndexMarker1771" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>season in the <a id="_idIndexMarker1772" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Northeastern part of the United States has always been my favorite time of the year, both as an adult and while growing up. I particularly enjoy the Halloween season during this time. With that being said, let’s begin the dynamic content update by taking inspiration from this season and seeing how I’ve added to the artwork for our ladybug player character from the 2D collection game:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.8 – Halloween-themed player character" src="img/B18347_15_08.jpg" class="calibre175"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.8 – Halloween-themed player character</p>
<p class="calibre3">Scary, right? As seen in the <code>Player</code> Prefab root named <code>Graphics_Halloween</code>. In the <code>GameObject</code> array with a header of <code>Theme Graphics</code>, where I’ve assigned both the original graphics, renamed to <code>Graphics_Default</code>, and the new holiday graphics.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">To follow along…</p>
<p class="callout">You can either update your ladybug player character with holiday graphics and add the <strong class="source-inline1">_graphics</strong> array to the <strong class="source-inline1">PlayerController</strong> script yourself (refer to the <em class="italic">Updating the player controller script</em> section that follows) or find the updated player character with both of these already completed in this book’s GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unity-2022-by-Example/tree/main/ch15/Game-Assets/SeasonalPlayer.zip" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unity-2022-by-Example/tree/main/ch15/Game-Assets/SeasonalPlayer.zip</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s see<a id="_idIndexMarker1773" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> how we’ll dynamically <a id="_idIndexMarker1774" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>switch to the Halloween graphics by setting up and coding a <strong class="bold">Remote </strong><strong class="bold">Config</strong> integration.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Adding Remote Config</h3>
<p class="calibre3">With Remote Config, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1775" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>can fine-tune game adjustments <a id="_idIndexMarker1776" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>for difficulty or time values, make personalization changes, or run timed events without having to distribute a new game build – providing we account for these features during our design and development phases, that is.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For our example, we’ll use a simple Boolean value for our configuration key value to turn on or off the display of the Halloween graphics. First things first, however, we need to install and configure Remote Config by following these steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">Open <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">In the <strong class="bold">Packages</strong> dropdown, change the context to <strong class="bold">Unity Registry</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Search for <code>remote</code>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Select <strong class="bold">Remote Config</strong> and click the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button:<ol class="calibre42"><li class="upper-roman">Note that Remote Config requires <strong class="bold">Authentication</strong> and will also install it.</li></ol></li>
<li class="calibre15">Once installed, go to <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Remote Config</strong> (no, I don’t know why it’s not also under <strong class="bold">Services</strong>):</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.9 – Remote Config key value settings in the Editor area" src="img/B18347_15_09.jpg" class="calibre176"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.9 – Remote Config key value settings in the Editor area</p>
<p class="calibre3">As seen in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.9</em>, by default, our environment will be <strong class="bold">production</strong>, but just know that you have the option of creating any number of additional environments for your needs – the first logical one would be <strong class="bold">development</strong> for working within the <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> area and testing before pushing to production (that is, your live players).</p>
<p class="calibre3">As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.9</em>, you can quickly access the Unity Cloud dashboard using the <strong class="bold">View in Dashboard</strong> button. The web dashboard allows you to add and change key values without firing up Unity Editor and is available from any computer or mobile device with a web browser; just go to <a href="https://cloud.unity.com/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://cloud.unity.com/</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s add the config key for controlling the visibility of our holiday graphics:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">With the <strong class="bold">Remote Config</strong> window open, click the <strong class="bold">View in Dashboard</strong> button to open the Unity Cloud dashboard:<ol class="calibre42"><li class="upper-roman">Yes, we can simply add a new key-value pair directly in the <strong class="bold">Remote Config</strong> window right within Unity Editor, and you can certainly do that now by clicking the <strong class="bold">Add Setting</strong> button. Still, we’re going to leverage the dashboard to cheat – ah, I mean, generate some starter code for this first setting.</li></ol></li>
<li class="calibre15">If the first<a id="_idIndexMarker1777" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> screen you see does not say <strong class="bold">Setup Guide</strong>, you<a id="_idIndexMarker1778" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> can find the link in the column to the left of the main window titled <strong class="bold">GAMING SERVICES Remote Config</strong>. There are a few options at the bottom, and one is <strong class="bold">Setup guide</strong> – click it.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Review the options for checking your environments and installing the package by confirming or simply clicking the defaults for <strong class="bold">Next</strong> and <strong class="bold">Finish</strong> since we won’t need to change anything here.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Now, click <code>Theme_Holiday</code></li><li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Type</strong>: <strong class="bold">Boolean</strong></li></ul></li>
<li class="calibre15">Click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>, set <strong class="bold">Value</strong> to <strong class="bold">true</strong>, and click <strong class="bold">Finish</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Now, we want to click the <code>RemoteConfigSettings</code> in a new <code>Assets/Scripts/Services</code> folder.</li><li class="upper-roman">Open the script in your IDE, delete all the existing template code, and paste the copied code.</li><li class="upper-roman">Rename the public class declaration from <code>ExampleSample</code> to <code>RemoteConfigSettings</code> and save (<em class="italic">Ctrl</em>/<em class="italic">Cmd</em> + <em class="italic">S</em>).</li></ol></li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Okay; we have started the first phase of our integration, but we’ll want to make two minor additions <a id="_idIndexMarker1779" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>to make it compatible with our other <a id="_idIndexMarker1780" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>scripts:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15">First, we’ll go ahead and make it a singleton instance so that we can access it from our <code>PlayerController</code> component</li>
<li class="calibre15">Second, we’ll add an event to listen for when the remote configuration has completed being fetched from the server so that we can update our graphics based on the current published value</li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Automating dynamic content | UGS use cases</p>
<p class="callout">Note that for this example, we’ll manually toggle the value for displaying the holiday theme graphics at the time we decide to. Still, Unity provides another way to automate this on a calendar schedule, which is<a id="_idIndexMarker1781" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> by using <strong class="bold">Game Overrides</strong>. This use case can be found in the Unity documentation here: <a href="https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/game-overrides/manual/use-cases" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/game-overrides/manual/use-cases</a>.</p>
<p class="callout">Many additional use cases for implementing UGS can be found here: <a href="https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/solutions/manual/Welcome" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/solutions/manual/Welcome</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Update the <code>RemoteConfigSettings</code> script with the following singleton pattern and <code>OnSettingsChanged</code> event:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
public class RemoteConfigSettings : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static RemoteConfigSettings Instance
        { get; private set; }
    private void Awake()
    {
        if (Instance == null)
            Instance = this;
        else
            Destroy(gameObject);
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
    }
    public event UnityAction&lt;RuntimeConfig&gt; OnSettingsChanged;
    …
}</pre> <p class="calibre3">Now, to be able <a id="_idIndexMarker1782" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>to invoke the event when the server <a id="_idIndexMarker1783" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>configuration values have been retrieved, add the following <code>OnSettingsChanged</code> invocation to the <code>ApplyRemoteSettings()</code> method:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
private void ApplyRemoteSettings(ConfigResponse configResponse)
{
    …
    OnSettingsChanged?.Invoke(
        RemoteConfigService.Instance.appConfig);
}</pre> <p class="calibre3">As you can see, we’re passing in the <code>RemoteConfigService</code> class’s <code>appConfig</code> object so that the event listeners can get their required config settings. With that, we can now add the Remote Config service to our game. Create a new GameObject in the scene named <code>RemoteConfig</code> and add the <code>RemoteConfigSettings</code> script. With that, we’re done – easy-peasy.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Architecture tip</p>
<p class="callout">For brevity and to keep things simple for this dynamic content example, I’ve decided to add the graphics changing directly to the <strong class="source-inline1">PlayerController</strong> script. However, you may want to consider making it a separate component for a more robust and reusable <em class="italic">dynamic graphics swapping </em><em class="italic">system</em> component.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now, all that’s left to do is add to the capability of our <code>PlayerController</code> component so <a id="_idIndexMarker1784" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>that we can get the configuration<a id="_idIndexMarker1785" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> setting value to determine whether to show the holiday graphic.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Updating the player controller script</h3>
<p class="calibre3">Open the <code>PlayerController</code> script <a id="_idIndexMarker1786" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>for editing and add the following declarations for holding <code>GameObject</code> references for the graphics (both the default and holiday versions) and a constant for the Remote Config settings key we previously defined:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
[SerializeField] private GameObject[] _graphics;
private const string THEME_HOLIDAY = "Theme_Holiday";</pre> <p class="calibre3">So that we can respond to the completion of the remote settings being fetched, let’s add a listener to the <code>OnSettingsChanged</code> event on the <code>RemoteConfigSettings</code> singleton instance:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
private void OnEnable()
    =&gt; RemoteConfigSettings.Instance.
        OnSettingsChanged += ConfigSettingsChanged;
private void OnDisable()
    =&gt; RemoteConfigSettings.Instance.
        OnSettingsChanged -= ConfigSettingsChanged;</pre> <p class="calibre3">We’ve also made sure we add a removal for the listener, like the good programmers we are.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Finally, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker1787" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>handle the <code>OnSettingsChanged</code> event being triggered by adding the following methods:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
private void ConfigSettingsChanged(RuntimeConfig config)
{
    var isThemeEnabled = config.GetBool(THEME_HOLIDAY, false);
    if (!isThemeEnabled)
        return;
    ShowThemeGraphics(1);
}
private void ShowThemeGraphics(int value)
{
    foreach (var g in _graphics)
    {
        g.SetActive(false);
    }
    _graphics[value].SetActive(true);
}</pre> <p class="calibre3">Alright, let’s do this one last time. A breakdown of the methods looks like this:</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><code>ConfigSettingsChanged()</code>: This method is the <code>OnSettingsChanged</code> event handler. Using the <code>RuntimeConfig</code> object passed in the event, we use its <code>GetBool()</code> method with the string constant for the key name, <code>THEME_HOLIDAY</code>, to retrieve the current value. <code>false</code> is used as the default value that’s returned should the key not be found:<ul class="calibre22"><li class="calibre15"><code>If (!isThemeEnabled)</code>: If the value that’s returned from <code>GetBool()</code> is <code>false</code>, we’ll short-circuit the method with <code>return</code>, leaving the default graphics as the currently visible graphics on the player character:<ul class="calibre22"><li class="calibre15">Otherwise, <code>ShowThemeGraphics(1)</code> is called and passed in an index value of <code>1</code>, meaning the second item that’s assigned in the <code>_graphics</code> array – where we assigned the Halloween graphics in the <code>0</code>, item #2 is index <code>1</code>, and so on.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li class="calibre15"><code>ShowThemeGraphics()</code>: Here, we simply iterate through all the GameObjects in the <code>_graphics</code> array using a <code>foreach</code> statement, setting each object’s active state to <code>false</code>. We immediately follow up by setting the object with the passed-in index value active, ensuring the graphics that are assigned to that index will be the graphics displayed with <code>_graphics[value].SetActive(true)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Save the script and<a id="_idIndexMarker1788" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> try it out! After entering <strong class="bold">Play Mode</strong>, you should see the graphics on your ladybug player character change to the holiday graphics created for the theme. Nice!</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Bonus activity</p>
<p class="callout">Update the <strong class="source-inline1">OnSettingsChanged</strong> event architecture so that it uses an implementation of the global event system we created in <a href="B18347_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor169" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After you build and publish your game, you can use the Unity Cloud dashboard to change the value of <code>Theme_Holiday</code> at any time to show/hide the holiday graphics without having to rebuild and redistribute a new game build.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Complete project code</p>
<p class="callout">You can download the completed 2D collection game project code for this chapter from this book’s GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unity-2022-by-Example/tree/main/ch15/Unity-Project" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Unity-2022-by-Example/tree/main/ch15/Unity-Project</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And speaking of building and distributing your game build, that’s something you’re going to have to do lots and lots of times throughout its life cycle. If only there were a way to simplify <a id="_idIndexMarker1789" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>and automate that process… oh wait, there is!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-303" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor323" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Publishing with Unity Build Automation</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Moving the build <a id="_idIndexMarker1790" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>process of <a id="_idIndexMarker1791" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>our local system to dedicated build servers – cloud-based systems, in this case – in our game development workflow offers several benefits but primarily improved productivity because our machines won’t be locked up during the build time. Builds generated on dedicated servers can also help to ensure consistency and reliability across all our game versions – significantly reducing the “<em class="italic">but it works on my </em><em class="italic">machine</em>” problem.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To help identify issues and catch bugs for our players early on, we can also integrate automated testing<a id="_idIndexMarker1792" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> and <strong class="bold">quality assurance</strong> (<strong class="bold">QA</strong>) into our automated build process. Additionally, we can automate the distribution of completed builds to various teams for further testing and, if required, publishing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It all starts with understanding the build process, so let’s have a look at building locally.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Building your game</h3>
<p class="calibre3">In <a href="B18347_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, we saw<a id="_idIndexMarker1793" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> how we can use <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong> to set the build target platform to <strong class="bold">Android</strong> and build to our head-mounted device for testing our MR game. Here, we can do the same thing but build our 2D collection game for standalone platforms, such as Windows and Mac PCs, by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">Open <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong> from <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Ensure that <strong class="bold">Platform</strong> is set to <strong class="bold">Windows, Mac, Linux</strong> (also known as <em class="italic">standalone</em>).</li>
<li class="calibre15">Select the desired platform in the <strong class="bold">Target</strong> dropdown (for example, Windows).</li>
<li class="calibre15">Click <strong class="bold">Build</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Build And Run</strong>, to automatically launch the game when the build finishes, and select a folder on your system to store the build.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Wait until the build finishes.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">You don’t have any choice; you have to sit there and wait… staring at the progress indicator minute by minute until it finishes. Luckily, with our small 2D game, this doesn’t take long at all, but that won’t always be the case as our games grow in size and complexity. Prepare to get up from your desk, go make a cup of coffee, and come back only to see that the progress bar has barely moved!</p>
<p class="calibre3">When the build finishes, you’ll have the files necessary to run your game in the folder you selected for the build. Open the folder in your system’s file explorer and run the EXE file to play the game. To distribute your game – share it with your team, friends, and family – zip up the contents of the folder (minus any folders ending in <code>DoNotShip</code>) and share it via an online<a id="_idIndexMarker1794" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> cloud storage service (such as Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or Box).</p>
<p class="calibre3">Still, we can do better. Let’s offload the build process to Unity Build Automation.</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Automating the build pipeline</h3>
<p class="calibre3">We’ve already<a id="_idIndexMarker1795" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> seen how to add Unity Version Control to our projects’ DevOps strategy. Well, automating a build is the second half of this DevOps story – specifically <strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong> – since we’ll use our project’s cloud workspace as the source for the cloud build configuration. This is how the cloud service gains access to our project files to perform the build.</p>
<p class="calibre3">First, let’s add <strong class="bold">Build Automation</strong> to our project by following these steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">Open <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">In the <strong class="bold">Packages</strong> dropdown, change the context to <strong class="bold">Unity Registry</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Search for <code>build</code>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Select <strong class="bold">Build Automation</strong> and click the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Once installed, click the <strong class="bold">Configure</strong> button (or, at any time, go to <strong class="bold">Services</strong> | <strong class="bold">Build Automation</strong> | <strong class="bold">Configure</strong>).</li>
<li class="calibre15">In the top-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> window, click the slider to enable Build Automation.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Click the <strong class="bold">Manage Build Targets</strong> button to open the Unity Cloud dashboard (in your default <a id="_idIndexMarker1796" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>web browser). This is where we’ll add our first build target:</li>
</ol>

</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.10 – Unity Cloud Build Automation configurations</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now, click the <strong class="bold">Get Started</strong> button to connect the source control provider and repository (that is, the workspace):</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">Select <strong class="bold">Unity Version Control</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Source control provider / SCM </strong><strong class="bold">type</strong> dropdown.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Select your Unity organization in the <strong class="bold">UVCS organization Server </strong><strong class="bold">URL</strong> dropdown.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Leave <strong class="bold">Authenticate with Unity </strong><strong class="bold">ID</strong> selected.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Click <strong class="bold">Save</strong> (at the top).</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Once the source control settings have been saved, proceed to <strong class="bold">Build Automation</strong> | <strong class="bold">Configurations</strong> and<a id="_idIndexMarker1797" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> follow these steps to add our build target:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">Click the <strong class="bold">Quick target </strong><strong class="bold">setup</strong> button.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Select <strong class="bold">Windows desktop 64-bit</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Select a platform to build </strong><strong class="bold">for:</strong> dialogue.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Confirm that the <strong class="bold">Repo</strong> field has been populated with your game:<ol class="calibre42"><li class="upper-roman">If you have more than one branch in your workspace, select the branch for building in the <strong class="bold">Branch</strong> dropdown.</li></ol></li>
<li class="calibre15">Under <strong class="bold">Versioning</strong>, select <strong class="bold">Always Use Latest 2022.3</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Unity </strong><strong class="bold">version</strong> dropdown.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Select <strong class="bold">Windows 11</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Builder Operating System and </strong><strong class="bold">Version</strong> dropdown.</li>
<li class="calibre15">Click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">On the <strong class="bold">Builder configuration</strong> screen, ensure <strong class="bold">STANDARD</strong> is selected and click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>.</li>
<li class="calibre15">On the <strong class="bold">Scheduling</strong> screen, for this example, we’re going to manually kick off the build process from within Unity Editor, so I prefer to enable <strong class="bold">Auto-cancel</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Important tip</p>
<p class="callout">You can change the scheduling of your builds at any time. The most popular strategy is to dedicate a branch in your workspace to automatically start a build when the branch has been updated.</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="9" class="calibre15">Click the <strong class="bold">Save </strong><strong class="bold">configuration</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Now, return to Unity Editor and reopen the Build Automation settings. When it refreshes, you’ll see we now have a build target that’s been added: <strong class="bold">Default Windows </strong><strong class="bold">desktop 64-bit</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">First, ensure your Unity Version Control workspace is up to date by checking in any pending changes for your project, and then click the <strong class="bold">Build</strong> button. A console entry will be created with a status of <strong class="bold">Build #1 Default Windows desktop 64-bit added to queue</strong> to notify you that the build has been queued.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can check the status of your cloud builds by clicking the <strong class="bold">Build History</strong> button or opening a web browser <a id="_idIndexMarker1798" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>on any device in the Unity Cloud dashboard under <strong class="bold">Build Automation</strong> | <strong class="bold">Build History</strong>.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Build Automation pricing</p>
<p class="callout">You can build faster for multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and WebGL, and on multiple machines simultaneously: <a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-devops#pricing" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://unity.com/products/unity-devops#pricing</a>.</p>
<p class="callout">Windows build includes 200 minutes for free per month. You pay for additional build minutes, Mac build minutes, additional concurrent build machines, and storage above 5 GB (per GB per month).</p>
<p class="calibre3">When the build finishes, if you’re still within Unity Editor, you’ll see a console message appear: <strong class="bold">Build #1 Default Windows desktop </strong><strong class="bold">64-bit success</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You’ll also receive an email with the subject <strong class="bold">Built ‘2D Collection Game’ for Windows x86_64</strong>, and the message <strong class="bold">‘2D Collection Game’ (Default Windows desktop 64-bit) #1 has been built for Windows x86_64!</strong> The email will also list any warnings or errors encountered during the build process and links to the cloud dashboard configuration.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Most importantly, an <strong class="bold">INSTALL</strong> link will be provided to download the build artifact (that is, files your team uses to deploy or test your application). Clicking the link will bring you to the Unity Cloud dashboard’s <strong class="bold">Build Details</strong> page for this build. You can download the game build by clicking the <strong class="bold">Download .ZIP file</strong> button. You can also easily share this build with anyone by clicking the <strong class="bold">Share</strong> button – you’ll be provided a share link and QR code that will remain valid for 14 days.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Automatic build sharing</p>
<p class="callout">You can enable automatically creating the build share link on the <strong class="bold">Build Automation Settings</strong> page. When enabled, the share link will be included in the email notification you receive when the build succeeds (preventing a trip to the Unity Cloud dashboard to grab it).</p>
<p class="callout">In addition to enabling automatic build sharing, Unity allows integrations with popular developer tools such as Discord, Slack, Jira, and Trello to create automated notifications in these spaces for both Build Automation and Cloud Diagnostics. You can configure your integrations in the Unity Cloud dashboard under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Project </strong><strong class="bold">integrations</strong> (<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIntegrations.xhtml" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIntegrations.xhtml</a>).</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we have<a id="_idIndexMarker1799" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> built our first standalone PC game, let’s publish it on <strong class="bold">Itch.io</strong> and share it with the world!</p>
<h3 class="calibre10">Publishing your game</h3>
<p class="calibre3">For this publishing <a id="_idIndexMarker1800" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>example, we’ll publish our game<a id="_idIndexMarker1801" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> to <strong class="bold">Itch.io</strong>. It’s the perfect platform for our little 2D collection game to start getting our indie title into players’ hands for some valuable playtesting, feedback, and bug squashing (Ack! But not our ladybug!).</p>
<p class="calibre3">Open Itch.io and register on the site; ensure you check off <strong class="bold">I’m interested in distributing content on </strong><strong class="bold">itch.io</strong>: <a href="https://itch.io/register" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://itch.io/register</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once registered, go to the <strong class="bold">Creator Dashboard</strong> area (that is, <strong class="bold">Dashboard</strong>) and click the <strong class="bold">Create new project</strong> button. This will bring you to the following screen, where you can start filling out all the required details and upload a screenshot for a cover image to display your game listing on the storefront:</p>

Ensure it’s set to <strong class="bold">Downloadable</strong>. Then, in the <strong class="bold">Uploads</strong> section below, click the <strong class="bold">Upload files</strong> button and select the ZIP file we created to distribute our game build in the <em class="italic">Building your game</em> section or from the build automation process.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Building for WebGL | Unity documentation</p>
<p class="callout">Note that<a id="_idIndexMarker1803" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> for Itch.io, you have the option of publishing a WebGL build of the game that will run directly within the player’s web browser instead of having to be downloaded. Before committing to a WebGL version of your game, you must ensure your game is playable and performant in a web browser to provide a good player experience.</p>
<p class="callout">Build your WebGL application: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/webgl-building.xhtml" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/webgl-building.xhtml</a>.</p>

<p class="callout-heading">Itch.io Devlogs</p>
<p class="callout">Have you heard <a id="_idIndexMarker1804" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>of a Devlog? It’s a forum post where game developers share updates on their ongoing projects. Anyone can leave comments and thoughts, which is an excellent way for players to stay informed about the latest developments in games they are interested in. Additionally, developers can use the forum to generate excitement and increase project engagement.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In this section, we learned how to add Unity LiveOps services to our 2D collection game, including core services such as Analytics and Cloud Diagnostics, and updating in-game content dynamically without requiring distributing a new game build with Remote Config. We also<a id="_idIndexMarker1805" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> learned how to set up Unity DevOps to automate our game build process while offloading it from our local machine. We finished with a quick game publishing example.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-304" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor324" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Summary</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we introduced and explored the concepts and strategies for operating and publishing GaaS to help achieve our commercial viability goals and, ultimately, success. By adopting GaaS and implementing the tools and technologies of both DevOps and LiveOps, we can build a solid foundation to support the ongoing release of games and content updates. This helps keep our players engaged and can provide longer lifetime value for our game releases.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Additionally, we learned how to safeguard all the hard work we put into our game projects by introducing source code management with Unity Version Control. We also learned how to set up and use version control within Unity Editor for a cloud-based DVCS solution and better structure our projects to minimize conflicts for team collaboration.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We gained a fundamental understanding of game economies and distribution channels while discussing how to better leverage player engagement to convert mobile free-to-play games into revenue through in-game purchases, ads, subscriptions, and premium purchases for PC games. Then, we provided a technical and financial feature breakdown of the top game distribution platforms for both free and premium games.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We concluded this chapter with examples of implementations of Unity LiveOps and DevOps. We achieved this by adding core cloud services, dynamically updating in-game content, building and automating the build process, and finally publishing our game.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-305" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor325" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Final words!</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Throughout these chapters, from the creative processes of designing games and working with art assets to the detailed implementations of programming mechanics and systems, we explored fundamental principles, solved problems, and celebrated overcoming challenges together. Whether you’re a seasoned professional, an indie dev, a student, or an aspiring hobbyist, I hope you’ve been provided with inspiration, insights, moments of revelation, and the occasional laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As this chapter comes to a close, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to each of you who has embarked on this adventure with me. Thank you. I am honored to have the opportunity to share my knowledge and experiences with such an incredible developer community.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All stories have an ending, and as such, this one has come to an end now, too. Still, it’s just one of many phases in our journey as game developers as we continue to work toward finishing and releasing our remarkable games.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Until next time… I have a game to finish now (and you do, too). Have fun!</p>
