    age, their current situation, their ambient location, their output device, their

    You want your interface to be usable by as many types of people as possible.

    greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Universal design is the concept of designing products that are usable by all
    people regardless of age, size, preference, ability, disability, condition, or
    situation. It does not focus on designing for a specific group of people but instead
    focuses on designing products that are useable by the widest range of people.
    While initially focused on architecture, the concepts of universal design have
    been expanded to include the design for all types of products, including video
    games. **Accessible design** is a design that specifically focuses on usability
    by those with impairments and disabilities and is a subset of universal design.

    the design is both functional and useful to all types of people. When designing
    a user interface, you should consider how to make it usable and accessible to
    all people from the beginning of the design process. It is much easier to design
    a universally usable and accessible UI if you start with these considerations
    in mind than it is to retrofit features on top of pre-existing interfaces.

    Principles of Universal Design. These principles are meant to help guide the design
    of products so that they can be universally usable. These principles are formally
    defined in terms of different types of designs with an emphasis on architecture.
    I will paraphrase each principle in terms of its application to digital user interfaces
    and then provide examples of how each principle can be used in video game interface
    design. If you’d like to view the list of principles and their specific guidelines,
    you can visit [https://universaldesign.ie/what-is-universal-design/the-7-principles/](https://universaldesign.ie/what-is-universal-design/the-7-principles/).

    appealing to all. If an identical experience is not possible for all, they should
    have an equivalent experience. An interface should be designed to appeal to all
    users and should not stigmatize or segregate users. This is the first principle
    because it ultimately drives all the other principles.
  prefs: []

    interfaces are not only appealing to all users but they help mobile users sitting
    in direct sunlight see your interface and they avoid stigmatizing users with visual
    impairments such as low vision and color blindness.
  prefs: []

    for accessibility (that is, designing for groups with disabilities). Utilizing
    something like a high-contrasting color scheme is beneficial to all, not just
    those with visual impairments. It is also not a setting that explicitly needs
    to be turned on, such as turning on a color blind mode, which would be designing
    for accessibility. I’ll discuss designing for accessibility later in this chapter.

    users to jump to multiple menus when it would be easier for them to do something
    all in a single view menu. You can reduce mouse usage/drag by assigning actions

    does not have to stretch their hands in ways that are either impossible or uncomfortable
    for those with smaller hands. If you have two buttons on a controller that are
    frequently used together, you want to make sure that the button combination is
    doable. For example, you do not want to ask them to hold down both the X button
    and the B button on the Xbox controller at the same time.

    easier than a keyboard.

    help those with different mobility issues. For example, I have problems with hand
