<h1 id="_idParaDest-318"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Communicating Technical Debt</h1>
<p>Most developers have worked in environments where they are unable to pay down technical debt, not due to the technical difficulty of the task, but because of organizational priorities, fears, urgent deadlines, and a lack of clear understanding of the full impact of technical debt on their software.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll explore some of these factors that can prevent you and your team from resolving technical debt and introduce some ways of helping the organization understand and value the refactoring process.</p>
<p>We’re going to cover the following main topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overcoming barriers to refactoring</li>
<li>Communicating technical debt</li>
<li>Prioritizing technical debt</li>
<li>Getting organizational buy-in</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-319"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>Overcoming barriers to refactoring</h1>
<p>When I speak with developers in the technical community, almost everyone has stories of being told that they were not allowed to spend time refactoring their code.</p>
<p>Sometimes this mandate <a id="_idIndexMarker876"/>came from upper management and sometimes from product management or someone involved in the agile process. However, just as often, the directive would come from engineering leadership such as a team lead or engineering manager.</p>
<p>The reasons for this can vary by the organization and project you’re working on, but some common reasons include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s an urgent deadline and the team must focus on meeting it</li>
<li>Refactoring the code isn’t perceived to provide any business value</li>
<li>The change would be to a risky area of the application with a lot of technical debt and there’s a risk of introducing bugs</li>
<li>Developers are told “Don’t worry about the quality of the code; this is just a prototype and won’t go into production” (it usually will)</li>
<li>The team is assured “Don’t worry about the quality of the code; we’re going to completely rewrite this application” (you usually won’t)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s talk about some<a id="_idIndexMarker877"/> of these objections.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-320"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>Urgent deadlines</h2>
<p>The “we’re on a deadline” objection is a<a id="_idIndexMarker878"/> very common one for many teams. Sometimes, teams are truly on a critical deadline that can’t be missed. During these times, it can often be “all hands on deck,” with people working in high-stress environments and typically working late hours as well. When this is the case, spending time to address technical debt can be disruptive to the team and its chances of meeting the deadline.</p>
<p>In other words, <em class="italic">sometimes, this objection is a legitimate one that makes sense for the business during a specific and limited period </em><em class="italic">of time</em>.</p>
<p>However, these high-urgency time periods cause technical debt to accumulate at a very high rate since developers aren’t given the time to do things the right way. While a team may be able to achieve amazing things in a short period of time, these things are rarely accomplished in a way that results in maintainable code that will stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Additionally, many organizations flow from urgent deadline to urgent deadline, causing long stretches of time where the team accumulates technical debt at a staggering rate while not being able to pay it down.</p>
<p>Sometimes deadlines cannot be altered or avoided, such as deadlines for the end of a fiscal year or a trade show or other conference. It can also be strategically beneficial to accumulate technical debt in the short term in return for meeting key business objectives that need to happen before a specific date.</p>
<p>However, it is your responsibility as a software engineer or engineering leader to clearly, succinctly, and regularly communicate technical debt and its impact to management. Once management adequately understands the obstacle, you must then work with them on long-term remediation steps and scheduling of the work needed for that effort.</p>
<p>We’ll talk more about this remediation process later in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-321"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>“Don’t touch high-risk code”</h2>
<p>The objection that certain portions of code are too brittle to touch more than needed, so we shouldn’t improve them, is a<a id="_idIndexMarker879"/> laughable one when you think about it. After all, if code has decayed to the point where you’re afraid to even try to improve it, the need for refactoring is likely one that has been postponed for some time.</p>
<p>While this code is dangerous to touch, not refactoring it could lead to disastrous results when the team is finally forced to make a change to it. Let’s examine the argument against refactoring this code.</p>
<p>The core concern in this case is often a combination of the following fears:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touching this code is likely to introduce bugs</li>
<li>We don’t understand how this code <em class="italic">should</em> work</li>
<li>There are no tests that would catch defects that might be introduced</li>
</ul>
<p>I find that this objection often occurs after key people leave a team and nobody else has any knowledge of a complex area that those individuals maintained. The code in question usually has little to no documentation and very few unit tests, if any are present at all.</p>
<p>These concerns don’t mean you can’t successfully improve or replace the code in question. In fact, some of the strategies we talked about in <em class="italic">Part 2 </em>of this book around testing code can significantly help with the fears behind this objection.</p>
<p>First, you can write unit tests around the code you’re changing before you make any changes. Some of the advanced testing tools we explored in <a href="B21324_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor189"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a> such as Snapper and Scientist .NET can help with this.</p>
<p>Deploying software in phased rollouts or with the option of rolling back can also help alleviate some fears, as we’ll see in <a href="B21324_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor354"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></a><em class="italic">, Agile Refactoring</em> when we talk about things such as feature flags and blue/green deployments.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>“This code is going away, don’t spend time on it”</h2>
<p>The objection that specific code is temporary and you shouldn’t worry about its quality typically occurs either at the <em class="italic">beginning</em> of software projects, during prototyping phases, or at the <em class="italic">end</em> of software projects, when you’ve determined whether you must replace or retire the entire<a id="_idIndexMarker880"/> application.</p>
<p>This often occurs when a team wants to test out a concept by building a quick “throwaway” prototype that can explore a concept or prove that a course of action is viable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many “throwaway” prototypes survive to become the foundation of a future application, despite being built for speed in proving a concept and having been designed intentionally to not worry about performance, security, or reliability.</p>
<p>A good prototype can get people so excited about the project that the following may occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>They forget they’re not dealing with “real” software and that the prototype was intended to be a temporary “throwaway”</li>
<li>They view the functionality provided in the prototype as already complete</li>
<li>The project gets an urgent deadline</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are certainly valid arguments that promoting a throwaway prototype to a real application is a symptom of mismanagement, let’s talk about productive things that members of the development team can do about this.</p>
<p>First, understand that your “throwaway” prototypes have a good chance of being viewed as working pieces of software. Some teams use rough styling or sketch-style user interfaces, such as the one in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.1</em>, to help others remember the application is just a prototype:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.1 – A sample user interface wireframe" src="img/B21324_15_1.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.1 – A sample user interface wireframe</p>
<p>Second, you can treat all code as production code deserving of refactoring, tests, and documentation, reducing your prototyping speed accordingly and somewhat defeating the idea of putting together a quick prototype.</p>
<p>Third, in the event that a throwaway prototype is promoted to an operational piece of software, the first pieces of <a id="_idIndexMarker881"/>work should be around reworking the prototype as needed to serve as the basis for the application’s future.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/>End-of-life applications</h2>
<p>The other time that code is viewed as non-permanent is when the application you’re developing is either at the end of its lifespan and about to be retired, or when people decide that the current level of technical debt requires a complete rewrite.</p>
<p>In the case when applications truly are end-of-life and will not be maintained for much longer, the technical debt may not be a critical problem – assuming the application actually does go offline in the near future. In this case, the team should know roughly when the application will go offline and this date should be confirmed regularly.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">It is important to check in regularly with management on the end-of-life status of the application. If the deactivation date is postponed or the decision to retire the application entirely seems less sure, you can change your posture to be more aggressive in your refactoring efforts.</p>
<p>If you have an application that has so much technical debt that you believe it cannot be solved without a rewrite, be very careful. I have seen many teams assume that their application will be retired and replaced by a successor, only to see the rewrite get delayed farther and farther down the road or even canceled entirely.</p>
<p>If you are depending on a rewrite to end your technical debt, I strongly recommend you have an estimated date for when that rewrite will start and when the old project will be retired. While software estimation can be challenging (as numerous books on the topic demonstrate), it is irresponsible to not improve your existing codebase without a believable timeline for<a id="_idIndexMarker882"/> the replacement coming online.</p>
<p>I have seen dozens of software projects over the last 20 years as a software engineer. Over that time, I have only seen two projects get completely rewritten. One of these projects was due to a technical necessity since its technology would no longer function past a certain date and the other involved extraordinary efforts by a lead engineer who was frustrated by maintaining the old version of the application.</p>
<p>You and your team will be better off if you assume that a complete rewrite will not happen and instead focus on paying down technical debt piece by piece.</p>
<p>We’ll talk more about strategies for gradually renewing and replacing applications in <a href="B21324_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor354"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></a><em class="italic">, </em><em class="italic">Agile Refactoring</em>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/>“Just do the minimum required”</h2>
<p>Occasionally, you’ll hear something to the effect of “Why are you spending all this time refactoring or testing? Just do the work required to complete the task.”</p>
<p>These statements can arise from a few different causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project being behind schedule</li>
<li>A lack of trust in the development team due to past delays</li>
<li>A lack of understanding of the importance of refactoring</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever I encounter this objection, I think of a camping analogy I’ve heard before.</p>
<p>When you go camping, you are expected to leave the campsite as good as you found it or slightly better. At the campsite, you are expected to not leave your trash strewn about, even though it is faster to do so than to spend time cleaning up after yourself. This is sometimes called the <strong class="bold">Boy </strong><strong class="bold">Scout Rule</strong>.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you go camping and you find your campsite to be a mess, it is entirely rational to spend <a id="_idIndexMarker883"/>some time cleaning up the campsite instead of setting up your tent on top of a pile of garbage!</p>
<p>Applying this analogy to development, when you go to make a change, you may need to modify some areas of your code that are not up to current standards, not tested, or in need of cleanup in general. It is not unreasonable for changes to a file to include fixes to other unrelated pieces of work.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are working on a small set of changes that affect a number of places throughout your application. You discover that one of those places has a significant amount of technical debt and likely needs several days of cleanup work to meet current standards. In this case, the appropriate thing to do would be to implement the small change in that area and talk about the additional refactorings needed during your next stand-up meeting. Often, the team will create a new separate work item for that larger refactoring effort.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Agile refactoring</p>
<p class="callout">We’ll talk more about tracking technical debt later in this chapter, and about refactoring in agile environments in <a href="B21324_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor354"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></a><em class="italic">, </em><em class="italic">Agile Refactoring</em>.</p>
<p>While cleaning up code is important, try to keep the amount of cleanup work you’re doing proportional to the size of the work item you’re working on.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-325"><a id="_idTextAnchor324"/>“Refactoring doesn’t provide business value”</h2>
<p>One of the most dangerous objections to refactoring that I’ve encountered has been the assumption that refactoring doesn’t provide any value beyond the development team.</p>
<p>That is to say that there is often an implicit assumption that developers only provide value to the organization when they add features or fix bugs. Under this mentality, things such as unit testing, refactoring, and documentation are all <em class="italic">waste activities</em> that developers do but do not provide meaningful value to the organization.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous assumption because managers are usually rewarded for minimizing waste and maximizing the most value possible to the organization. When refactoring and testing are not valued by leadership, organizations trade technical debt accumulation for short-term boosts in things they value, such as new features being delivered. This results in <a id="_idIndexMarker884"/>long-term consequences as technical debt grows rampant, development slows to a crawl, and bugs are introduced with nearly every change.</p>
<p>One reason for this devaluation of refactoring work is that new features are visible and often understandable to management, while technical debt is something they only hear about and cannot see.</p>
<p>Anything you as a developer or engineering leader can do to help management understand the scope and effects of technical debt will help resolve this objection.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll explore ways of helping improve the visibility of technical debt to non-developers.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-326"><a id="_idTextAnchor325"/>Communicating technical debt</h1>
<p>Explaining <strong class="bold">technical debt</strong> to non-developers can be challenging. Even when management trusts the development team, it is difficult for managers to understand what engineers deal with or how<a id="_idIndexMarker885"/> technical debt slows the software engineering process and introduces tremendous quality risks whenever the application is changed.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>Technical debt as risk</h2>
<p>In the course of my career, I’ve learned that while management has trouble understanding technical debt, there’s something they have a much better understanding of: <em class="italic">risk</em>.</p>
<p>This may sound strange, but I’ve found the best way to help management understand technical debt is to present it in terms of risk management.</p>
<p>Every aspect of <a id="_idIndexMarker886"/>technical debt in your system has both a <strong class="bold">probability</strong> and an <strong class="bold">impact</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">probability</strong> of a piece of technical debt is the likelihood that the piece of technical debt will impact the development team during development or when the application is running in production.</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">impact</strong> is how much the technical debt will hurt things if it <em class="italic">does</em> impact the developers or deployed applications.</p>
<p>For example, code in a critical area with medium complexity that is lacking tests might have a low or medium<a id="_idIndexMarker887"/> probability of producing issues, but would have a critical impact if those issues arose. That is to say that the code isn’t currently causing issues, but we think there’s a medium probability that it may be changed in the future in such a way that introduces a bug we won’t catch due to the complexity of the system. If this does occur, we believe that the impact on end users will be severe.</p>
<p>When you can represent each risk in your codebase with an impact and probability, it allows management to start understanding the level of risk the current slate of technical debt represents.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-328"><a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>Creating a risk register</h2>
<p>These risk entries should be arranged into a spreadsheet or other series of tracked items (such as work items in the system) called a <strong class="bold">risk register</strong>. The risk register becomes a centralized place for<a id="_idIndexMarker888"/> management and development leaders to review the current risks present in software engineering projects.</p>
<p>Your risk register might benefit from including the following pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">ID</strong> – A unique identifier for the risk</li>
<li><code>FlightManager's </code><code>ScheduleFlight</code> method”</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Status</strong> – Whether the risk is open, in the process of being remediated, or closed</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Probability</strong> – The probability that the risk affects future development or users of the system</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Impact</strong> – The severity of the impact of the risk if it materializes</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Priority</strong> – A priority for the risk based on its probability and impact</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample risk register for Cloudy Skies Airlines would look like the following:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.2 – A sample risk register" src="img/B21324_15_2.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.2 – A sample risk register</p>
<p>Your register doesn’t have to be limited to these columns. The person the risk is assigned to, the area or component the risk is in, and the estimated effort to resolve it are all fields you might want to consider adding, depending on your needs.</p>
<p>When delays or production issues<a id="_idIndexMarker889"/> inevitably occur, you can point to existing risks in the risk register. This should help management understand that the risks have materialized into <strong class="bold">issues</strong>.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Risks versus issues</p>
<p class="callout">In risk management terminology, a risk is something that may occur while an issue is a risk that has materialized by actually occurring.</p>
<p>This helps resist the temptation to blame the engineers involved in the change and instead helps focus the conversation on the risks present in the existing technical debt.</p>
<p>By forming a shared risk register with management, you can actively involve them in the process of managing and resolving technical debt. This is an ongoing process involving regular risk review meetings, where the team must actively maintain the register as new risks are discovered or opinions on the potential impact or probability of existing risks change.</p>
<p>In these risk review meetings, the group should review the current risk register and discuss any changes that have occurred since the previous month.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-329"><a id="_idTextAnchor328"/>Alternatives to a risk register</h2>
<p>I understand that not <a id="_idIndexMarker890"/>every developer, engineering leader, or even member of upper management feels comfortable working with a formal risk register.</p>
<p>If you’d be more comfortable with a simpler process, you can achieve a similar amount of value by trying one of the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a simple bulleted list in a Word document – perhaps organized by major project or area</li>
<li>Creating a new <em class="italic">technical risk</em> type of item in work item tracking software, such as <strong class="bold">Jira</strong> or <strong class="bold">Azure DevOps</strong></li>
<li>Having a regular newsletter that goes out to developers and business stakeholders with the “top 10 most wanted” pieces of technical debt</li>
</ul>
<p>The format of the risk<a id="_idIndexMarker891"/> register isn’t the most important part of the process. The important part of the process is that your team is actively itemizing technical debt as it is detected and regularly reviewing it with management to involve them in the process of resolving it.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-330"><a id="_idTextAnchor329"/>Prioritizing technical debt</h1>
<p>Tracking and communicating <a id="_idIndexMarker892"/>technical debt is a critical part of the process of paying it down. However, it’s just one step in the process.</p>
<p>While refactoring code as related code is modified can be a viable strategy for paying down technical debt, this approach isn’t suitable for tackling large pieces of technical debt or debt that is related to the overall design of the software.</p>
<p>In <a href="B21324_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor354"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></a><em class="italic">, Agile Refactoring</em>, we’ll talk more about managing these larger pieces of work in an agile environment, but for now, let’s look at how you determine which pieces of technical debt should be prioritized.</p>
<p>You want to prioritize addressing the items that are most likely to occur and those that will hurt the most if they do occur. In other words, if you have a high probability risk, you should prioritize that. Additionally, you should prioritize your high-impact pieces of technical debt.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-331"><a id="_idTextAnchor330"/>Calculating risk priorities with a risk score</h2>
<p>I’ve seen some <a id="_idIndexMarker893"/>organizations create a <strong class="bold">risk score</strong> out of the<a id="_idIndexMarker894"/> impact and probability of each technical risk they track. This risk score is a math equation where the probability of occurrence of a piece of technical debt is written as a number from 0 to 1, with 1 being 100% certain to happen and 0 meaning it will never happen.</p>
<p>This results in a formula<a id="_idIndexMarker895"/> where you can calculate the priority of a piece of technical debt by multiplying its probability by its impact. This formula is as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
risk = impact * probability</pre>
<p>For example, a high-probability, low-impact piece of technical debt might have a 0.9 probability score and an impact <a id="_idIndexMarker896"/>of 3, resulting in a risk score of 2.7.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Units and risk scores</p>
<p class="callout">2.7 what, exactly? Well, we’re not really measuring anything tangible unless you choose to represent impact in hours or dollars, so I refer to this number as simply the “risk score” representing the overall expected negative impact the business expects by having the technical debt item present. This is useful for comparing two risks to each other.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a different scenario with a high-impact, low-probability tech debt item, scored at 0.15 probability and an impact of 21, resulting in a risk score of 3.15.</p>
<p>Here, the organization typically would focus on the second item because its overall risk score of 3.15 is higher than the 2.7 risk score of the first item, meaning it represents a larger threat to the organization.</p>
<p>Further refinements to this approach might also factor in the estimated hours needed to resolve a piece of technical debt, so items that can be resolved faster can be prioritized over equivalent items that would take longer.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-332"><a id="_idTextAnchor331"/>The “gut feeling” approach</h2>
<p>It can be hard to<a id="_idIndexMarker897"/> numerically quantify things with any precision and estimates can sometimes feel more like wishful thinking than scientifically accurate predictions. I do think there’s value in getting some rough numbers on risks, but typically, team members will have a deeper “gut feeling” about the magnitude of some items over others.</p>
<p>My stance is that numerical guides can be helpful, but your brain can point out other things that are important but hard to measure.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">My rule of thumb is that you should focus on fixing the things that scare you the most. If there’s an area of your code that keeps you up at night, it’s usually a good idea to start there.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that <a id="_idIndexMarker898"/>you should stop all new development until technical debt is resolved (though sometimes this is needed in severe scenarios). I’m saying that when you get to pick what should be resolved, you should pick the area your team believes is the largest threat to the organization’s success. Once you’re done with the biggest problem, move on to the next one and then the next after that, while continuing to support the needs of the business.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-333"><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/>Getting organizational buy-in</h1>
<p>We’ve seen how we can track and prioritize technical debt, and we’ve seen how involving management in the process of tracking technical risk can help build trust and understanding, but let’s talk about scenarios where development leadership must “pitch” a major refactoring effort to management.</p>
<p>These conversations can be stressful and represent a critical turning point in software projects. In these high-stakes<a id="_idIndexMarker899"/> conversations, your goal is to communicate the following things succinctly and respectfully:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem facing the team and its impact if it is not resolved</li>
<li>The proposed solution (or a set of proposed solutions to consider)</li>
<li>The cost of the refactoring effort in terms of developer hours</li>
<li>The timetable of the refactoring effort</li>
<li>What you’d like management to do</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that your goal here <em class="italic">isn’t</em> to get them to agree to what you are proposing. Your goal is to get them to understand the issue and work with you on determining when and how it should be resolved.</p>
<p>When your focus is on<a id="_idIndexMarker900"/> getting your way at all costs, this can result in a loss of trust, growing hostilities between development and management, and a feeling that developers cannot think in terms of business needs.</p>
<p>Instead, if you view your partners in management as having legitimate insights and value to add to the organization, the conversation can become something different – a partnership where engineering and management work together for both the long-term and short-term needs of the business.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-334"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>Setting up the conversation</h2>
<p>Before you can even have a conversation about the problem, you need to be able to effectively communicate the <a id="_idIndexMarker901"/>problem and the scope of its potential solutions.</p>
<p>This will take some consideration and planning. You don’t need to have a detailed project plan in place for this, but you do need to think through the scope of the project, the pieces that will need to change, and the people who will need to be involved.</p>
<p>You’ll also need to consider your team’s current projects and what the people you’re looking to involve are currently working on, or slated to be working on soon.</p>
<p>Remember that for your organization to say “yes” to your refactoring effort, they’ll need to say “no” to something else for the duration of your refactoring effort.</p>
<p>Once you have a sufficient understanding of the scope of the problem and its solution, you should bring it to management. This can be done either as part of a regular check-in meeting between engineering leadership and management or as its own meeting.</p>
<p>How you approach the meeting invite will depend on the individual you’re approaching.</p>
<p>Some leaders may be receptive to you stopping by their office or sending them a direct message and saying something to the effect of “I have some concerns about the project. Do you have 30 minutes sometime to talk about this in more detail?”</p>
<p>On the other hand, other leaders will want to have the conversation as soon as you broach the topic. For this reason, I recommend you prepare for the conversation and find a time when their calendar appears clear.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-335"><a id="_idTextAnchor334"/>Anticipating questions and objections</h2>
<p>As you present your concerns and options to management, you should keep in mind the types of questions or objections they might raise. Be prepared to drill into the technical details of the current<a id="_idIndexMarker902"/> problem as well as your proposed solutions.</p>
<p>It’s also typical for management to want details on project timelines. This can include not only how long you expect the refactoring effort to take, but also <em class="italic">how long the project can wait to </em><em class="italic">be started</em>.</p>
<p>Remember that most organizations have major projects tentatively scheduled for at least the next quarter. Taking on a refactoring effort typically requires rearranging current and planned work in other areas. As an example, look at <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.3</em> for a sample breakdown of major initiatives by quarter for the web, services, and integration teams:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.3 – A project roadmap broken down by team and quarter" src="img/B21324_15_3.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.3 – A project roadmap broken down by team and quarter</p>
<p>While the integration team may want to spend time in Q2 working on a piece of technical debt, doing so would risk the services team’s planned work on connecting to a new vendor and potentially delay the integration team’s own planned paid services work, both slated to begin in Q3.</p>
<p>Be honest about the urgency of the issues your team is facing. Sometimes the answer is that it can wait, but the longer it is delayed the greater the penalty the team faces. At other times, refactoring efforts are needed to resolve urgent and already pressing issues the team is encountering with the current system.</p>
<p>Additionally, keep in mind the background of the person you’re talking to and the people they talk to. If you’re talking to a very security-oriented person and you haven’t thought through the security ramifications of your change, that conversation is likely not going to go well.</p>
<p>You don’t need to have an answer for every question you are asked, and it is acceptable to say “I don’t know; let me look into that and get back to you.”</p>
<p>The bottom line is that changes to project schedules are serious matters and if you appear to have not taken the time to think about the most obvious concerns, it will not inspire confidence <a id="_idIndexMarker903"/>among management.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-336"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"/>Different approaches for different leaders</h2>
<p>I’ve met a lot of different people in management and it’s amazing how different two skilled leaders can be from one another.</p>
<p>Some leaders are extremely <a id="_idIndexMarker904"/>analytical and incredibly data-driven, wanting to pore over reports and spreadsheets. Others are people-oriented and driven not as much by raw numbers as they are by <em class="italic">specific stories</em> of how something affects specific individuals.</p>
<p>For leaders focused on the overall data, I usually present key metrics and highlight interesting findings. I often provide all relevant data to them for further analysis, either preemptively or upon request.</p>
<p>An example metric might be that we spent 15 hours over the last 3 sprints dealing with this problem, or that 15% of the bugs from the last quarter could be traced back to this area.</p>
<p>As far as sharing specific stories goes, I usually come prepared with two or three examples of how a problem impacts developers, end users, or other relevant stakeholders. This might be something such as “Last sprint, Priya tried to work on a new feature we thought would only take a few hours, but because of how this is architected, it actually took her 3 days,” or “Garret is a very competent developer, but he tried to modify this area of code and it wound up causing this critical production bug due to the code’s lack of maintainability.”</p>
<p>An approach that works well with one individual may have very little impact on a different person. As a result, I find it best to have a few interesting metrics and a few relevant scenarios whenever I have these critical conversations on major refactoring efforts.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-337"><a id="_idTextAnchor336"/>The importance of communication</h2>
<p>One thing I hope you’ve picked up on in this chapter is that while you want to resolve technical debt, your goal is the short-term and long-term success of the organization.</p>
<p>This means that any conversation about technical debt should be a two-way conversation where both parties listen to each other and can have their voices heard.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the legitimate <a id="_idIndexMarker905"/>short-term needs of a business are to ship something as fast as possible or to meet a deadline with an external partner or agency.</p>
<p>As an engineering leader, your goal is to ensure management understands the impact, urgency, and risk that technical debt represents and the importance of both small and large refactoring efforts. However, your focus is typically on the code, while management’s focus is centered on strategic initiatives or even simply keeping the business afloat and the lights on. Both roles and their perspectives are critically important to a healthy organization.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, what you’re really after is open and honest communication between engineering and management where management can appreciate the risk and impact of technical debt and engineering can understand the pressures facing the organization.</p>
<p>This communication starts with trust and respecting the contributions that management brings to the table in terms of steering the overall organization toward its goals and balancing priorities and needs that often compete with one another.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-338"><a id="_idTextAnchor337"/>Case study – Cloudy Skies Airlines</h1>
<p>As we close the chapter, let’s look at our case study from Cloudy Skies Airlines.</p>
<p>Brian, a lead developer, has been investigating a growing number of problems with the reservation and payment <a id="_idIndexMarker906"/>processing part of the application.</p>
<p>These issues, initially thought to be isolated, seem to occur during peak usage times when many customers are trying to book flights or modify their existing flight reservations.</p>
<p>After investigating, Brian and his team discover that the problems are related to the current design and architecture of the system. While the system could handle the old number of users, it is simply not able to adequately scale to handle peak workloads given its current inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, such a system could be scaled out to have multiple servers running in parallel with a load balancer distributing traffic between them (see <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.4</em>):</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.4 – A load balancer distributing requests to different application servers</p>
<p>However, the system<a id="_idIndexMarker907"/> was not designed to support multiple copies of the application running at once without significant rework.</p>
<p>While the team is able to make some short-term performance and stability improvements to resolve the current issues, they understand that as the business grows, these problems will just resurface – particularly in peak travel seasons.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, the team comes up with a plan that would allow the system to run multiple copies in parallel but would require a significant amount of rework.</p>
<p>One of the engineers also suggests potentially moving from a model where the server does all the work and returns a successful response to the user to a model where the request is quickly validated and then put in a queue for processing. This approach would handle spikes in incoming requests but would require changes to how request processing currently works.</p>
<p>Armed with these ideas and knowledge of the scope of the current problem and possible fixes, Brian schedules a meeting with Maddie, the Chief Technology Officer.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Brian lays out the performance problem, the recent steps the team has taken to restore service, and the likelihood that it will occur again as the business grows and peak seasons approach.</p>
<p>Once Brian is sure Maddie understands the basics of the problem, he gives an overview of the two possible remediation plans, as well as his personal recommendation to stick with the relatively simpler change of working to allow the application server to support multiple copies in parallel.</p>
<p>Maddie asks several technical questions about scalability, particularly around why the current system is unable to have multiple copies running at once. After Brian explains the problems that would cause, Maddie understands the reasoning and the need for remediation and the conversation shifts toward<a id="_idIndexMarker908"/> scheduling.</p>
<p>The next focus for the team was going to be integrating a newly acquired subsidiary airline into Cloudy Skies systems, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.5</em>:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.5 – The planned schedule showing major projects by quarter and the current date</p>
<p>Upon reviewing the problem, Maddie and Brian both agree that having a long-term solution in place for the scalability problems is more important, particularly with some peak travel seasons approaching.</p>
<p>Maddie brings other executives into the conversation on the specifics of the plan and Brian answers their questions, while the team begins planning the architectural changes needed and the technical details of how the application could be scaled out as needed to handle additional traffic loads.</p>
<p>After a short delay, the project is approved and the majority of Brian’s team is assigned to the effort, with the understanding that the previously planned work would begin later than originally scheduled to make room for the new scalability project, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.6</em>:</p>

<p>Brian and Maddie continue to check in on the progress of the work, and the scalability concerns are addressed before the peak travel times arrive.</p>
<p>In the meantime, some team members are able to make progress in integrating the new subsidiary into the Cloudy Skies systems. As engineers finish their work on the scalability concerns, they transition over to that project, resulting in only a minor delay to that project’s initially planned delivery date.</p>
<p>In the end, the business gets a more stable and <a id="_idIndexMarker909"/>scalable system as well as their planned integration of the new subsidiary, in addition to an improved communication channel between management and the software engineering team.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-339"><a id="_idTextAnchor338"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we explored common objections to refactoring code and paying down technical debt and some reasons and remedies for them.</p>
<p>We also talked about communicating technical debt to management, particularly the idea of technical debt being viewed as a risk to the organization’s systems and productivity. We also introduced the idea of using a risk register to track technical debt over time and improve the visibility of technical debt to non-developers.</p>
<p>We closed with a discussion about prioritizing technical debt, getting permission from management for larger refactoring projects, and the importance of trust, communication, and establishing a partnership with management in the remediation effort.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll explore the value of code standards in terms of minimizing technical debt over time and how to choose an existing standard or build your own.</p>
