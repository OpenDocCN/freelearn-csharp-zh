- en: We have a skeletal structure of an enterprise application at the moment. While
    filling this skeleton with business and technical functionality, we will come
    across a lot of code and constructs that will be used across the layers. These
    are sometimes referred to as cross-cutting concerns. Examples of cross-cutting
    concerns include threading, collections, logging, caching, configuration, networking,
    and dependency injection. In this part, we will quickly recap these fundamentals
    from the point of view of .NET 6 and enterprise applications. In each of these
    chapters, we will be developing a class library for one of the cross-cutting concerns
    that will be integrated with the UI and service layer.
