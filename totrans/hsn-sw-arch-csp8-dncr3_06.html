<p>To design your application so that it's cloud-based, you have to understand different architectural designs—from the simplest to the most sophisticated. This chapter discusses different software architecture models and teaches you how to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the cloud in your solutions. This chapter will also discuss the different types of cloud service that we can consider while developing our infrastructure, what the ideal scenarios are, and where we can use each of them.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure as a Service solutions</li>
<li>Platform as a Service solutions</li>
<li>Software as a Service solutions</li>
<li>Serverless solutions</li>
<li>How to use hybrid solutions and why they are so useful</li>
</ul>

<p>For the practical content in this chapter, you have to create or use an Azure account. I've explained the account creation process in <span><a href="14b5c5da-4042-439e-9e5a-2e19ba4c4930.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture</em>, in the <em>Creating an Azure account</em> section.</span></p>

<p>Cloud solutions can be deployed with different models. The way you decide to deploy your applications depends on the kind of team you work with. In companies where you have infrastructure engineers, you will probably find more people working with <strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong>IaaS</strong>). On the other hand, in companies where IT is not the core business, you will find a bunch of <strong>Software as a Service</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>) systems. It is really common for developers to decide to use the <strong>Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong>PaaS</strong>) option, or go serverless, as they have no need to deliver infrastructures in this scenario.</p>
<p>As a software architect, you have to cope with this environment and be sure that you are optimizing the cost and work factors, not only during the initial development of the solution but also during its maintenance. Also, as an architect, you have to understand the needs of your system and work hard to connect those needs to best-in-class peripheral solutions to speed up delivery and keep the solution as close as possible to the customer's specifications.</p>

<p>IaaS was the first generation of cloud services provided by many different cloud players. Its definition is easily found in many places, but we can summarize it as "your computing infrastructure delivered on the internet". In the same way that we have virtualization of services in a local data center, IaaS will also give you virtualized components, such as servers, storage, and firewalls in the cloud.</p>
<p>In Azure, several services are provided with an IaaS model. Most of them are paid for and you should pay attention to this when it comes to testing. It is worth mentioning that this book does not set out to describe all of the IaaS services that Azure provides in <span>detail</span>. However, as a software architect, you just need to understand that you will find services such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtual machines</strong>: Windows Server, Linux, Oracle, and Data Science - Machine Learning</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong>: Virtual networks, load balancers, and DNS zones.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Files, tables, databases, and Redis.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Perform the following steps to create any service in Azure:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have to find the service that best fits your needs and then create a resource. The following screenshot shows a Windows Server virtual machine being configured:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3ae11954-4d10-4cb6-a375-273a4b5ea36b.png"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Follow the wizard provided by Azure to set up your virtual machine and then connect to it using <strong>Remote Desktop Protocol</strong> (<strong>RDP</strong>). A great curiosity from this kind of subscription is related to the capacity of hardware that you can have in some minutes. The following screenshot exemplifies this:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b87dda8f-ef3a-4892-a2dd-63851aaaed3e.png"/></p>
<p>If you compare the on-premise velocity to deliver hardware and cloud velocity, you will realize that there is nothing better than the cloud when it comes to time-to-market. For instance, the <span class="packt_screen">D64s_v3</span> machine presented at the bottom of the screenshot with 64 CPUs, 256 GB of RAM, and temporary storage of 512 GB is something you probably will not find in an on-premise data center. Besides, in some use cases, this machine will just be used for some hours during the month so it will be impossible to justify its purchase in an on-premise scenario. This is why cloud computing is so amazing!</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Security responsibility in IaaS</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Security responsibility is a<span>nother important thing to know about </span>an IaaS platform. Many people think that once you decide to go on the cloud, all of the security is done by the provider. However, this is not true as you can see in the following screenshot: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b4872c47-694e-4d86-9493-dde523d779ce.png"/></p>
<p>IaaS will force you to take care of security from the operating system to the application. In some cases, this is inevitable, but you have to understand that this will increase <span>your system cost</span>.</p>
<p>IaaS can be a good option if you just want to move an already existing o<span>n-premise </span>structure to the cloud. This enables scalability, due to the tools that Azure gives you along with all of the other services. However, if you are planning to develop an application from scratch, you should also consider other options available on Azure.</p>
<p>Let's check one of the fastest systems in the next section, that is, PaaS.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">PaaS – a world of opportunities for developers</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>If you are studying or have studied software architectures, you will probably understand perfectly the meaning of the next sentence: the World demands high speed when it comes to software development! If you agree with this, you will love PaaS.</p>
<p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, PaaS allows you to worry about security only in terms of aspects that are closer to your business: your data and applications. As a developer, this represents freedom from having to implement a bunch of configurations that make your solution work safely. </p>
<p>Besides, security handling is not the only advantage of PaaS. As a software architect, you can introduce these services as an opportunity to deliver <span>richer solutions </span>faster. Time-to-market can surely justify the cost of many applications that run on a PaaS basis.</p>
<p>There are lots of services delivered as PaaS nowadays in Azure and, again, it is not the purpose of this book to list all of them. <span>However, some of them do need to be mentioned. </span>The list keeps growing and the recommendation here is: use and test services as much as you can! Make sure that you will deliver better-designed solutions with this thought in mind. </p>
<p>On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that, with PaaS solutions, you will not have full control of the operating system. In fact, in many situations, you do not even have a way to connect to it. This is good most of the time, but in some debugging situations, you may miss this feature. The good thing is that PaaS components are evolving every single day and one of the biggest concerns from Microsoft is making them widely visible.</p>
<p>The following sections present the most common PaaS components delivered by Microsoft for .NET Core web apps such as Azure web apps and Azure SQL Server. We also <span>describe</span> Azure Cognitive Services, a very powerful PaaS platform that demonstrates how wonderful development <span>is</span><span> </span><span>in the PaaS world. We will explore some of them on greater depth in the remainder of this book.</span></p>

<p>A web app is a PaaS option you can use to deploy your web app. You can deploy different types of application, such as .NET, .NET Core, Java, PHP, Node JS, and Python. A sample of this was presented in <a href="14b5c5da-4042-439e-9e5a-2e19ba4c4930.xhtml">Chapter 1</a><span>, </span><em>Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture</em>.</p>
<p>The good thing is that creating a web app doesn't require any structure and/or <span>IIS web server </span>setup. In some cases, where you are using Linux to host your .NET Core application, you do not have IIS at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, web apps have a plan option where you don't need to pay for usage. Of course, there are limitations, such as only running 32-bit apps and failing to enable scalability, but this can be a wonderful scenario for prototyping.</p>

<p>Imagine how fast you can deploy a solution if you have all of the power of an SQL Server without needing to pay for a big server to deploy this database. This applies to Azure SQL Server. With Azure SQL Server, you have the opportunity to use Microsoft SQL Server to perform what you need the most—storage and data processing. In this scenario, Azure assumes responsibility for backing up the database.</p>
<p>Azure SQL Server even gives you the option to manage performance by itself. This is called automatic tuning. Again, with PaaS components, you will be able to focus on what is really important to your business: a very fast time-to-market.</p>
<p>The steps for creating an Azure SQL Server database are quite simple, like what we checked before for other components. However, there are two things you need to pay attention to: the creation of the server itself and how you will be charged.</p>
<p>When you search Azure SQL Server about creating a database, you will find this wizard to help you: </p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d992dedc-f3ff-4a5d-a998-e2a7c1bb1039.png"/></p>
<p>As you can see, you have to create (at least for the first database) a <kbd>database.windows.net</kbd> server, where your databases will be hosted. This server will provide all of the parameters you need to access the SQL Server database using current tools such as Visual Studio or SQL Server Management Studio. It is worth mentioning that you have a bunch of features regarding security, such as transparency encryption and IP firewall. </p>
<p>As soon as you decide on the name of your database server, you will be able to choose the pricing tier on which your system will be charged. Especially in Azure SQL Server databases, there are several different pricing options, as you can see in the following screenshot. You should study each of them <span>carefully</span> because, depending on your scenario, you may save money by optimizing a pricing tier:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e4bbf53a-ef63-40bd-92d4-3424bb4c84dd.png"/></p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>For more information about SQL configuration, you can check this link: </span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/</a>.</div>
<p>Once you have the configuration done, you will be able to connect to this <span>server </span>database in the same way you do when your SQL Server is installed on-premise. The only detail that you have to pay attention to is the configuration of the Azure SQL Server firewall, but this is quite simple to set up and a good demonstration of how safe the PaaS service<span> </span><span>is</span><span>.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Azure Cognitive Services</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) is one of the most frequently <span>discussed </span>topics in software architecture. We are a step away from a really great world where AI will be everywhere. To make this last sentence come true, as a software architect you cannot think about AI as software you need to reinvent every time from scratch.</p>
<p>Azure Cognitive Services can help you with this. In this set of APIs, you will find various ways to develop vision, knowledge, speech, searches, and language solutions. Some of them need to be trained to make things happen, but these services provide APIs for that too.</p>
<p>The great thing about PaaS is evident from this scenario. The number of jobs you will have to perform to prepare your application in an on-premise or IaaS <span>environment is enormous. In PaaS, you just do not need to worry about this. You're totally focused on what really matters to you as a software architect: the solution to your business problem.</span></p>
<p>Setting up Azure Cognitive Services in your Azure account is also quite simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, will need to add Cognitive Services like any other Azure component, as you can see in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/89012b31-4bda-4d49-9eb6-d88a20863f89.png" style="width:33.17em;height:44.00em;"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>As soon as you have done this, you will be able to use the APIs provided by the server. You will find two important features in the service you've created: endpoints and access keys. They are going to be used in your code to access APIs:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d3936856-0ab7-4e8a-9c7e-84dc35ca7937.png"/></p>
<p><span>The following code sample shows how you can use Cognitive Services to translate sentences. The main concept underlying this translation service is that you can post the sentence you want to translate, according to the key and region where the service was set. The following code enables you to post a request to the service API:</span></p>
<pre>private static async Task&lt;string&gt; PostAPI(string api, string key, string region,<br/>    string textToTranslate)<br/>{<br/>    string result = String.Empty;<br/>    using (var client = new HttpClient())<br/>    {<br/>      using (var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, api))<br/>      {<br/>        request.Headers.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", key);<br/>        request.Headers.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region", region);<br/><br/>        // five seconds for timeout<br/>        client.Timeout = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 5);<br/>        var body = new object[] { new { Text = textToTranslate } };<br/>        var requestBody = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(body); <br/><br/>        request.Content = new StringContent(requestBody, Encoding.UTF8,<br/>          "application/json");<br/><br/>        var response = await client.SendAsync(request);<br/><br/>        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)<br/>          result = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();<br/>      }<br/>    }<br/>    return result;<br/>}</pre>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the preceding code will allow you to post requests to translate any text into any language provided you define it in the parameters. The following is the main program that calls the previous method:</p>
<pre>/// &lt;summary&gt;<br/>/// Check this content at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive<br/>/// services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference<br/>/// &lt;/summary&gt;<br/>static void Main()<br/>{<br/>    var host = "https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com";<br/>    var route = "/translate?api-version=3.0&amp;to=es";<br/>    var subscriptionKey = "[YOUR KEY HERE]";<br/>    var region = "[YOUR REGION HERE]";<br/><br/>    var translatedSentence = PostAPI(host + route, subscriptionKey, region, <br/>      "Hello World!").Result;<br/>    Console.WriteLine(translatedSentence);<br/>}</pre>
<p><span>This is a perfect example of how easily and quickly you can use services such as this to architect your projects. Also, this kind of approach to development is really good, since you are using a piece of code already tested and used by other solutions.</span></p>

<p>Software as a Service is probably the easiest way to use cloud-based services. <span>Cloud players </span>provide many good options that solve common problems in a company <span>for their end users</span>.</p>
<p>A good example of this type of service is Office 365. The key point with these platforms is that you don't need to worry about application maintenance. This is particularly convenient in scenarios where your team is totally focused on developing the core business of the application. For example, if your solution needs to deliver good reports, maybe you can design them using Power BI (which is included in Office 365). </p>
<p>Another pretty good example of an SaaS platform is Azure DevOps. As a software architect, before Azure DevOps or <strong>Visual Studio Team Services</strong> (<strong>VSTS</strong>), you needed to install and configure Team Foundation Server (or even older tools like this one) to make your team work with a common repository and an application life cycle management tool. </p>
<p><span>We used to spend a lot of time just working either on preparing the server for <strong>Team Foundation Server</strong> (<strong>TFS</strong>) installation or on upgrading and continuously maintaining the TFS already installed. This is no longer needed due to the simplicity of SaaS Azure DevOps.</span></p>

<p>The word explains itself: a serverless solution means a solution without a server. But how can this be possible in a cloud architecture? It is pretty simple. You do not have to worry about anything related to the server in such a solution. </p>
<p>You may now be thinking that serverless is just another option—of course, this is true as this architecture does not deliver a complete solution. But the key point here is that, in a serverless solution, you have a very fast, simple, and agile application <span>life cycle</span> since all serverless code is stateless and loosely coupled with the remainder of the system. Some authors refer to this as <strong>Function as a Service</strong> (<span><strong>FaaS</strong>)</span>. </p>
<p>Of course, the server runs somewhere. The key point here is that you don't need to<span> worry about this, or even scalability. This will enable you to focus completely on your app business logic. Again, the World needs fast development and good customer experiences at the same time. The more you focus on customer needs, the better!</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Why are hybrid applications so useful in many cases?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Hybrid solutions are solutions whose parts do not share a uniform architectural choice; each part makes a different architectural choice. In the cloud, the word hybrid refers mainly to solutions that mix cloud subsystems with on-premise subsystems. However, it can refer also to mixing web subsystems with device-specific subsystems.</p>
<p>Due to the number of services Azure can provide and the number of design architectures that can be implemented, hybrid applications are probably the best answer to the main question addressed in this chapter, that is, how to use the opportunities offered by the cloud in your projects. Nowadays, many current projects are moving from an on-premise solution to a cloud architecture and, depending on where you are going to deliver these projects, you will still find many bad preconceptions regarding moving to the cloud. Most of them are related to cost, security, and service availability.</p>
<p>You need to understand that there is some truth in these preconceptions, but not in the way people think. For sure, you as a software architect cannot ignore them. Especially when you develop a critical system, you have to decide whether everything can go on the cloud or whether it is better to deliver part of the system on the edge.</p>
<p>Mobile solutions can be considered a classic example of hybrid applications since they mix a web-based architecture with a device-based architecture to offer a better user experience. There are lots of scenarios where you can replace a mobile application with a responsive website. However, when it comes to interface quality and performance, maybe a responsive web site will not give the end user what they really need.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will discuss the practical example of the book use case. </p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>If you go back to <a href="14b5c5da-4042-439e-9e5a-2e19ba4c4930.xhtml">Chapter 1</a><span>, </span><em>Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture</em><span>,</span> you will find a system requirement that describes the system environments where our WWTravelClub example application is supposed to run:</p>
<div class="packt_quote">SR_003: The system shall run in Windows, Linux, iOS and Android platforms.</div>
<p><span>At first sight,</span> any developer would respond by saying: web apps. However, the iOS and Android platforms will <span>also </span>need your attention as a software architect. I<span>n this scenario, as in several situations, user </span>experience is the key to the success of the project. The decision needs to be driven not only by development speed but again by the benefits gained by delivering a great user experience.</p>
<p>Another decision that the software architect must make in this project is related to the technology for the mobile application if they decide to develop one. Again, this is going to be a choice between hybrid and native apps since, in this case, a hybrid solution such as Xamarin can be used. So, with mobile applications, you <span>also </span>have the option to keep writing the code in C#.</p>
<p>The following screenshot represents our first choice for the WWTravelClub architecture. The decision to rely on Azure components is related to cost and maintenance considerations. Each of the following items will be discussed later on in this book, in <a href="8c8a9dbc-3bfc-4291-866f-fdd1a62c16ef.xhtml">Chapter 6</a><span>,</span> <em>Interacting with Data in C# - Entity Framework Core</em>, <a href="77cdecb5-cef4-4b02-80a1-052ad366b9f3.xhtml">Chapter 7</a><span>, </span><em>How to Choose Your Data Storage in the Cloud</em>, and <a href="2b061d97-54d8-4a0b-b325-95c056c0348a.xhtml">Chapter 8</a><span>, </span><em>Working with Azure Functions</em>, together with the reasons for the choice. For now, it is enough to know that WWTravelClub is a hybrid application, running Xamarin Apps on mobiles and a .NET Core web app on the server side:</p>

<p><span>There will be an Azure SQL Server database connected from the web app by Entity Framework Core, which will be discussed in <a href="8c8a9dbc-3bfc-4291-866f-fdd1a62c16ef.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Interacting with Data in C# - Entity Framework Core</em>. Later on, in <a href="77cdecb5-cef4-4b02-80a1-052ad366b9f3.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>How to Choose Your Data Storage in the Cloud</em>, we will also add NoSQL databases for performance and cost reasons. For picture storage, file storage is chosen. To finish, Xamarin Apps will get information from the system through Azure Functions.</span></p>

<p>As you can verify in the screenshot in the last section, the WWTravelClub architecture was designed mainly with Platform as a Service and serverless components provided by Azure. All of the development will be conducted inside the <span>Azure </span><span>DevOps </span>SaaS Microsoft Platform.</p>
<p>In the imaginary scenario we have in WWTravelClub, the sponsors have indicated that <span>no one in the WWTravelClub team specializes in infrastructure.</span> This is why the software architecture uses PaaS services. Considering this scenario and the required development speed, these components will surely perform well.</p>
<p>While we fly through the chapters and technologies discussed in this book, this architecture will change and evolve without being constrained by any earlier choices. This is a great opportunity offered by Azure and by modern architecture design. You can easily change components and structures as your solution evolves.</p>

<p>In this chapter, you learned how to take advantage of the services offered by the cloud in your solutions, and the various options you can choose from.</p>
<p>This chapter covered different ways to deliver the same application in a cloud-based structure. We also noted how rapidly Microsoft is delivering all of these options to its customers, because you can experience all of these options in actual applications and choose the one that best fits your needs since there is no <em>silver bullet</em> that works in all situations. As a software architect, you need to analyze your environment and your team, and then decide on the best cloud architecture to implement in your solution.</p>
<p>The next chapter is dedicated to how to build a flexible architecture made up of small scalable software modules called microservices.</p>
