- en: Hello there! We are here to explore design and development patterns that we
    can leverage when building a microservice application with .NET. Microservice
    architecture involves separating a potentially complex application into smaller,
    more maintainable services that must work together. Essentially, we take one big
    application and break it down into smaller parts.
  id: totrans-1
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This approach introduces a fresh crop of complexities in the application’s design
    since these now separate services need to collaborate to deliver a unified experience
    to the end user. As such, we need to understand the various drawbacks of this
    architectural approach and strategize on how we can address the various concerns.
