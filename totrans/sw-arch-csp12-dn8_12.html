<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-243">Choosing Your Data Storage in the Cloud</h1>
<p class="normal">Azure, like other clouds, offers a wide range of storage services. The first approach that we may consider is defining a scalable set of virtual machines hosted in the cloud where we can implement our custom solutions. For instance, we can create a SQL Server cluster on our cloud-hosted virtual machines to increase reliability and computational power. However, usually, custom architectures are not the optimal solution and do not take full advantage of the opportunities offered by cloud infrastructure. Scalability, fast setup, focus on the business, and security are some of the criteria that you might consider while deciding on your data storage on Azure. To help you with this, many of the <strong class="keyWord">platform-as-a-service</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">PaaS</strong>) options<a id="_idIndexMarker867"/> for storing data can be a great solution.</p>
<p class="normal">Therefore, this chapter will not discuss such custom architectures but will focus mainly on the various PaaS storage offerings that are available in the cloud and on Azure. These offerings include scalable solutions based on plain disk space, relational databases, NoSQL databases, and in-memory data stores such as Redis.</p>
<p class="normal">Choosing a more adequate storage type is based not only on the application’s functional requirements but also on performance and scaling-out requirements. In fact, while scaling out when processing resources causes a linear increase in performance, scaling out storage resources does not necessarily imply an acceptable increase in performance. In short, no matter how much you duplicate your data storage devices, if several requests affect the same chunk of data, they will always queue for the same amount of time to access it!</p>
<p class="normal">Scaling out data causes linear increases in read operation throughput since each copy can serve a different request, but it doesn’t imply the same increase in throughput for write operations since all copies of the same chunk of data must be updated! Accordingly, more sophisticated techniques are required to scale out storage devices, and not all storage engines scale equally well.</p>
<p class="normal">Relational databases do not scale well in all scenarios. Therefore, scaling needs and the need to distribute data geographically play a fundamental role in the choice of a storage engine, as well as in the choice of SaaS offering.</p>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-245">Understanding the different repositories for different purposes</h1>
<p class="normal">This section describes the functionalities that are offered by the most popular data storage techniques. We will mainly focus on the functional requirements they are able to satisfy. Performance and scaling-out features will be analyzed in the next section, which is dedicated to comparing relational and NoSQL databases.</p>
<p class="normal">In Azure, the various offerings can be found by typing product names into the search bar at the top of all Azure portal pages.</p>
<p class="normal">The following subsections describe the various kinds of databases that we can use in our C# projects.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-246">Relational databases</h2>
<p class="normal">These databases are<a id="_idIndexMarker868"/> the most common and studied type of storage. They guarantee a high level of service and store an immeasurable amount of data. Dozens of applications have been designed to store data in this kind of database, and we can find them in banks, stores, industries, and so on. When you store data in a relational database, the basic principle is to define the entities and properties you will save in each of them, defining the correct relationship between these entities.</p>
<p class="normal">For decades, relational databases were the only option imagined for designing great projects. Many big companies around the world have built their own database management system. Oracle, MySQL, and MS SQL Server would be listed by many as the ones you can trust to store your data.</p>
<p class="normal">Usually, clouds offer several database engines. Azure offers a variety of popular database engines, such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server (Azure SQL).</p>
<p class="normal">Regarding the Oracle database engine, Azure offers configurable virtual machines with various Oracle editions installed on them, which you can easily verify by the suggestions you get after typing <code class="inlineCode">Oracle</code> into the Azure portal search bar. Azure fees do not include Oracle licenses; they just include computation time, so you must bring your own license to Azure.</p>
<p class="normal">With MySQL on Azure, you pay to use a private server instance. The fees you incur depend on the number of cores you have, how much memory must be allocated, and backup retention time.</p>
<p class="normal">MySQL instances are redundant, and you can choose between local or geographically distributed redundancy:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_12_01.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.1: Creating a MySQL server on Azure</p>
<p class="normal">Azure SQL Database<a id="_idIndexMarker869"/> was one of the first PaaS options available on Azure, and for this reason, it has evolved a lot in recent years, which has made it one of the most flexible offers. Today, it also includes a serverless pricing model, where you are billed for the compute used per second. Here, you can configure resources that are used by every single database. When you create a database, you have the option to place it on an existing server instance or create a new instance. </p>
<p class="normal">There are several pricing options that you may choose while defining your solution, and Azure keeps incrementing them to make sure you will be able to handle your data in the cloud. Basically, they vary due to the computing capacity you need.</p>
<p class="normal">For instance, in the <strong class="keyWord">Database Transaction Units</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">DTUs</strong>) model, fees are based on the database storage<a id="_idIndexMarker870"/> capacity that has been reserved and a linear combination of I/O operations, CPU usage, and memory usage that is determined by a reference workload. Considering the difficulty of understanding exactly how DTUs are calculated, Azure also <a id="_idIndexMarker871"/>offers <strong class="keyWord">vCore-based</strong> models, where you have flexibility, control, and transparency of individual resource consumption.</p>
<p class="normal">Roughly, maximal <a id="_idIndexMarker872"/>database performance increases linearly when you increase the DTUs.</p>
<div><p class="normal">You can find detailed information about the options you have for purchasing Azure SQL<a id="_idIndexMarker873"/> Database at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/purchasing-models?view=azuresql">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/purchasing-models?view=azuresql</a>.</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.2: Creating an Azure SQL Database</p>
<p class="normal">You can also configure<a id="_idIndexMarker874"/> data replication by enabling read scale-out. This way, you can improve the performance of read operations. Backup retention is fixed for each offering level (basic, standard, and premium).</p>
<p class="normal">If you select <strong class="keyWord">Yes</strong> for <strong class="keyWord">Want to use SQL elastic pool?</strong>, the database will be added to an elastic pool. Databases that are added to the same elastic pool will share their resources, so resources that are not used by a database can be used during the usage CPU peaks of other databases. It is worth mentioning that elastic pools can only contain databases hosted on the same server instance. Elastic pools are an efficient way to optimize resource<a id="_idIndexMarker875"/> usage to reduce costs.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-247">NoSQL databases</h2>
<p class="normal">One of the biggest <a id="_idIndexMarker876"/>challenges that relational databases have caused software architects is related to how we deal with database structural schema changes. The agility of changes needed at the beginning of this century brought the opportunity to use a new database style called NoSQL. The next subtopics will present several types of NoSQL databases.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-248">Document-oriented database</h3>
<p class="normal">The most common <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>type of database, where you have the key and complex data, is called a document.</p>
<p class="normal">For instance, in NoSQL document-oriented databases, relational tables are replaced with more general collections that can contain heterogeneous JSON objects. That is, collections have no predefined structure and no predefined fields with length constraints (in the case of strings) but can contain any type of object. The only structural constraint associated with each collection is the name of the property that acts as a primary key.</p>
<p class="normal">More specifically, each collection entry can contain nested objects and object collections nested in object properties, that is, related entities that, in relational databases, are contained in different tables and connected through external keys. In NoSQL, databases can be nested in their parent entities. Since collection entries contain complex nested objects instead of simple property/value pairs, as is the case with relational databases, entries are not called tuples or rows but <em class="italic">documents</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">No relations and/or external key constraints can be defined between documents that belong to the same collection or to different collections. If a document contains the primary key of another document in one of its properties, it does so at its own risk. The developer is responsible for maintaining and keeping these coherent references. This is a tradeoff that you, as a software architect, must analyze. If you design a system that is generally dependent on relational databases, the gain of NoSQL will not be achieved, and you are at the same time sacrificing data integrity and redundancy. However, if you have a scenario where flexibility is needed, you must consider NoSQL as an option.</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, NoSQL storage is quite cheap. You can store a great amount of data as Base64 string properties. The developer can define rules to decide what properties to index in a collection. Since documents are nested objects, properties are tree paths. It is worth saying that you can specify which collection of paths and subpaths are indexed.</p>
<p class="normal">Almost all NoSQL databases are queried either with a subset of SQL or with a JSON-based language where queries are JSON objects whose paths represent the properties to query and whose values represent the query constraints that have been applied to them.</p>
<p class="normal">The possibility of nesting children objects inside documents can be simulated in relational databases with the help of one-to-many relationships. However, with relational databases, we are forced to redefine the exact structure of all the related tables, while NoSQL collections do not impose any predefined structure on the objects they contain. The only constraint is that each document must provide a unique value for the primary key property.</p>
<p class="normal">It is true that today, we have the possibility to define JSON columns in relational databases such as Azure SQL, so we can take a hybrid approach when defining our data model, having a schema for part of it but being flexible on other parts of it. However, NoSQL databases continue to be the best option when the structure of our objects is extremely variable, like social media and <strong class="keyWord">Internet of Things </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">IoT</strong>) solutions.</p>
<p class="normal">However, often, they are chosen for the way they scale out read and write operations and, more generally, for their performance advantages in distributed environments. Their performance <a id="_idIndexMarker878"/>features, which compare them to relational databases, will be discussed in the next section.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-249">Graph database</h3>
<p class="normal">Social media <a id="_idIndexMarker879"/>sites tend to use this kind of database since the data is stored as graphs.</p>
<p class="normal">The graph data model is an extreme case of a completely unstructured document. The whole database is a graph where queries can add, change, and delete graph documents.</p>
<p class="normal">In this case, we have two kinds of documents: nodes and relationships. While relationships have a well-defined structure (the primary key of the nodes connected by the relationship, plus the relationship’s name), nodes have no structure at all since properties and their values are added together during node update operations.</p>
<div><p class="normal">It is important to you, as a software architect, to decide if this kind of structure presented in graph databases is the best one for the use case for which you are designing the system, always remembering that such a decision can make the system more complicated than needed.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Graph data models were conceived to represent the features of people and the objects they manipulate (media, posts, and so on), along with their relationships in <em class="italic">social applications</em>. The Gremlin language was conceived specifically to query graph data models. We will not<a id="_idIndexMarker880"/> discuss this in this chapter, but references are available in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-250">Key-value database</h3>
<p class="normal">This is a useful <a id="_idIndexMarker881"/>database for implementing caches since you can store key-value pairs. Redis is a great example of it and it will be detailed soon in this chapter.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-251">Wide-column store database</h3>
<p class="normal">This is a type of database <a id="_idIndexMarker882"/>where the same column in each row can store different data.</p>
<p class="normal">NoSQL databases will be analyzed in detail in the remaining sections of this chapter, which are dedicated to describing Azure Cosmos DB and comparing it with relational databases.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-252">Redis</h2>
<p class="normal">Redis is a distributed <a id="_idIndexMarker883"/>in-memory storage based on key-value pairs and supports distributed queuing. It can be used as permanent in-memory storage and as a web application cache for database data. Alternatively, it can be used as a cache for pre-rendered content.</p>
<p class="normal">Redis can also be used to store a web application’s user session data. This was done originally with Microsoft SQL Server, but due to the performance provided by memory databases, Redis is the best alternative today.</p>
<p class="normal">In fact, ASP.NET Core supports session data to overcome the fact that the HTTP protocol is stateless. More specifically, user data that is kept between page changes is maintained in server-side stores such as Redis and indexed by a session key stored in cookies.</p>
<div><p class="normal">Interaction with the Redis server in the cloud is typically based on a client implementation that offers an easy-to-use interface. The client for .NET is available through the <code class="inlineCode">StackExchange.Redis</code> NuGet package. The basic operations of the <code class="inlineCode">StackExchange.Redis</code> clients have been documented in <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/Basics">https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/Basics</a>, while the full documentation can be found at <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis">https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">The user interface <a id="_idIndexMarker884"/>for defining a Redis server on Azure is quite simple:</p>

<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-253">Azure storage accounts</h2>
<p class="normal">All clouds offer <a id="_idIndexMarker887"/>scalable and redundant general-purpose disk memory that you can use as virtual disks in virtual machines and/or as external file storage. Azure <em class="italic">storage account</em> disk space can also be structured in <strong class="keyWord">tables</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">queues</strong>. Consider using this option if you need cheap blob storage. However, there are more sophisticated options, as we have mentioned before. Depending on the scenario you have, Azure NoSQL databases are a better option than tables, and Azure Redis is a better option than Azure storage queues.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_12_04.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.4: Creating a storage account</p>
<p class="normal">In the rest of this <a id="_idIndexMarker888"/>chapter, we will focus on NoSQL databases and how they differ from relational databases. Next, we will look at how to choose one over the other.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-254">Choosing between SQL and NoSQL document-oriented databases</h1>
<p class="normal">As a software<a id="_idIndexMarker889"/> architect, you may consider some aspects of SQL and NoSQL databases to decide the best storage option for you. In many cases, both will be needed. The key point here will surely be how organized your data is and how big the database will become.</p>
<p class="normal">In the previous section, we stated that NoSQL document-oriented databases should be preferred by you, as a software architect, when data has almost no predefined structure. They not only keep variable attributes close to their owners, but they also keep some related objects close since they allow related objects to be nested inside properties and collections.</p>
<p class="normal">Unstructured data can be represented in relational databases if variable properties of a tuple (<code class="inlineCode">t</code>) can be placed in a connected table containing the property name, property value, and the external key of <code class="inlineCode">t</code>. However, the problem in this scenario is performance. In fact, property values that belong to a single object would be spread all over the available memory space. In a small database, <em class="italic">all over the available memory space</em> means far away but on the same disk; in a bigger database, it means far away but in different disk units; in a distributed cloud environment, it means far away but in different – and possibly geographically distributed – servers.</p>
<p class="normal">On the other hand, in the NoSQL document-oriented database design, we always try to put all related objects that are likely to be processed together into a single entry. Related objects that are accessed less frequently are placed in different entries. Since external key constraints are not enforced automatically, and NoSQL transactions are very flexible, the developer can choose the best compromise between performance and coherence.</p>
<p class="normal">It is important to mention that today, we can store unstructured data as columns with JSON (or XML) types in relational databases. This approach allows the use of patterns typically implemented in document databases to also be achievable in relational databases, such as avoiding joins by inserting complete objects in a JSON column. However, the adoption of the NoSQL document-oriented database can be considered the best option since it was designed for this purpose.</p>
<p class="normal">Therefore, we can conclude that relational databases perform well when tables that are usually accessed together can be stored close together. NoSQL document-oriented databases, on the other hand, automatically ensure that related data is kept close together since each entry keeps most of the data it is related to inside it as nested objects. Therefore, NoSQL document-oriented databases perform better when they are distributed to a different memory and to different geographically distributed servers.</p>
<p class="normal">Unfortunately, the only way to scale out storage write operations is to split collection entries across several servers according to the values of <em class="italic">shard keys</em>. For instance, we can place all the records containing usernames that start with <strong class="keyWord">A</strong> on a server, the records containing usernames that start with <strong class="keyWord">B</strong> on another server, and so on. This way, write operations for usernames with different start letters may be executed in parallel, ensuring that the write throughput increases linearly with the number of servers.</p>
<p class="normal">However, if a <em class="italic">shard</em> collection is related to several other collections, there is no guarantee that related records will be placed on the same server. Also, putting different collections on different servers without using collection sharding increases write throughput linearly until we reach the limit of a single collection per server, but it doesn’t solve the issue of being forced to perform several operations on different servers to retrieve or update data that are usually processed together.</p>
<p class="normal">This issue becomes <a id="_idIndexMarker890"/>catastrophic for performance in relational databases if access to related distributed objects must be transactional and/or must ensure structural constraints (such as external key constraints) are not violated. In this case, all related objects must be blocked during the transaction, preventing other requests from accessing them during the whole lifetime of a time-consuming distributed operation.</p>
<p class="normal">NoSQL document-oriented databases do not suffer from this problem and perform better with sharding and, consequently, with write-scaled output. This is because they do not distribute related data to different storage units and instead store them as nested objects of the same database entry. On the other hand, they suffer from different problems, like not supporting transactions by default.</p>
<p class="normal">It is worth mentioning that there are situations where relational databases perform well with sharding. A typical instance is a multi-tenant application. In a multi-tenant application, all entry collections can be partitioned into non-overlapping sets called <strong class="keyWord">tenants</strong>. Only <a id="_idIndexMarker891"/>entries belonging to the same tenant can refer to each other, so if all the collections are sharded in the same way according to their object tenants, all related records end up in the same shard, that is, in the same server, and can be navigated efficiently.</p>
<div><p class="normal">In this chapter, we did not talk about how to define sharding with Azure SQL. Here is the link to the official documentation if you want to find out more: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-elastic-scale-introduction">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-elastic-scale-introduction</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Multi-tenant applications are not rare in the cloud since all applications that offer the same services to several different users are often implemented as multi-tenant applications, where each tenant corresponds to a user subscription. Accordingly, relational databases, such as Azure SQL Server, are conceived to work in the cloud and usually offer sharding options for multi-tenant applications. Typically, sharding is not a cloud service and must be defined with database engine commands. Here, we will not describe how to define shards with Azure SQL Server, but the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section contains a link to the official Microsoft documentation. The following table presents the pros and cons of<a id="_idIndexMarker892"/> each database approach:</p>

<p class="normal">In conclusion, relational databases offer a pure, logical view of data that is independent of the way they are stored and use declarative language to query and update them. This simplifies development and system maintenance, but it may cause performance issues in a distributed environment that requires write scale-out. It is also worth noting that tools like Entity Framework, presented in <em class="italic">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">Interacting with Data in C# – Entity Framework Core</em>, help in bridging the gap between objects and relational data, making development more intuitive for relational databases.</p>
<p class="normal">In NoSQL document-oriented databases, you must handle more details about how to store data, as well as some procedural details for all the update and query operations, manually, but this allows you to optimize performance in distributed environments that require both read and write scale-out. On the flip side, working with NoSQL data, especially when it involves deserializing formats like JSON or XML, can be tricky. It often requires careful <a id="_idIndexMarker893"/>mapping to ensure data integrity, which can be both challenging and error-prone. In the next section, we will look at Azure Cosmos DB, the main Azure NoSQL offering, which, fortunately, can be integrated with Entity Framework for a more streamlined development experience.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-255">Azure Cosmos DB – an opportunity to manage a multi-continental database</h1>
<p class="normal">Azure Cosmos DB is <a id="_idIndexMarker894"/>Azure’s main NoSQL offering. Azure Cosmos DB has its own interface that is a subset of SQL, but it can be configured with a MongoDB interface, a Table API, or a Cassandra API. It can also be configured as a graph data model that can be queried with Gremlin.</p>
<div><p class="normal">You can find further details about Cosmos DB in the official documentation: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Cosmos DB allows replication for fault tolerance and read scale-out, and replicas can be distributed geographically to optimize communication performance. Moreover, you can specify which data center all the replicas are placed in. The user also has the option to write-enable all the replicas so that writes are immediately available in the geographical area where they are done. Write scale-up is achieved with sharding, which the user can configure by<a id="_idIndexMarker895"/> defining which properties to use as shard keys.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-256">Creating an Azure Cosmos DB account</h2>
<p class="normal">You can define<a id="_idIndexMarker896"/> a Cosmos DB account by typing <code class="inlineCode">Cosmos DB</code> into the Azure portal search bar and clicking <strong class="keyWord">+ Create</strong>. The following page will appear:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Interface gráfica do usuário, Aplicativo  Descrição gerada automaticamente" src="img/B19820_12_05.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.5: Creating an Azure Cosmos DB account</p>
<p class="normal">For instance, if you select the <strong class="keyWord">Core (SQL)</strong> option, the account name you choose is used in the resource URI as <code class="inlineCode">{account_name}.documents.azure.com</code>. Then, you can decide which location the main database will be placed in and the capacity mode. You can check more information about the capacity modes available at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/throughput-serverless">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/throughput-serverless</a>.</p>
<p class="normal">Microsoft keeps improving many of its Azure services. The best way to keep updated about new features of any Azure component is by checking its documentation from time to time.</p>
<p class="normal">On the <strong class="keyWord">Global Distribution</strong> tab, the <strong class="keyWord">Multi-region Writes</strong> toggle lets you enable writes on geographically distributed replicas. If you do not do this, all write operations will be routed to the main location. Finally, you may also define network connectivity, backup policies, and encryption <a id="_idIndexMarker897"/>during the creation process.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-257">Creating an Azure Cosmos DB container</h2>
<p class="normal">Once you have <a id="_idIndexMarker898"/>created your Azure Cosmos DB – Core SQL account, select <strong class="keyWord">Data Explorer</strong> to create your databases and containers inside of them. A container is the unit of scalability both for provisioned throughput and storage, available when you decide by provisioned throughput capacity mode.</p>
<p class="normal">Since databases just have a name and no configuration, you can <strong class="keyWord">Add a container</strong> directly and then place the database where you wish:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Interface gráfica do usuário, Texto, Aplicativo, Email  Descrição gerada automaticamente" src="img/B19820_12_06.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.6: Adding a container in Azure Cosmos DB</p>
<p class="normal">Here, you can decide on database and container names and the property to use for sharding (the partition key). Since NoSQL entries are object trees, property names are specified as paths. You can also add properties whose values are required to be unique.</p>
<p class="normal">However, the uniqueness of IDs is checked inside each partition, so this option is only useful in certain situations, such as multi-tenant applications (where each tenant is included in a single shard). The fees depend on the collection throughput that you choose.</p>
<p class="normal">This is where you need to target all resource parameters to your needs. Throughput is expressed in request units per second, where request units per second are defined as the throughput we <a id="_idIndexMarker899"/>have when performing a read of 1 KB per second. Hence, if you check the <strong class="keyWord">Provision database throughput</strong> option, the chosen throughput is shared with the whole database instead of being reserved as a single collection.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-258">Accessing Azure Cosmos DB</h2>
<p class="normal">After creating the<a id="_idIndexMarker900"/> Azure Cosmos container, you will be able to access data. To get connection information, you can select the <strong class="keyWord">Keys</strong> menu. There, you will see all the information you need to connect with your Cosmos DB account from your application. The connection information page will provide you with the account URI and two connection keys, which can be used interchangeably to connect with the account.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Text  Description automatically generated with medium confidence" src="img/B19820_12_07.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.7: Connection information page</p>
<p class="normal">There are also keys with read-only privileges. Every key can be regenerated, and each account has two equivalent keys, like many other Azure components. This approach enables operations <a id="_idIndexMarker901"/>to be handled efficiently; that is, when a key is changed, the other one is kept. Therefore, existing applications can continue using the other key before upgrading to the new key.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-259">Defining database consistency</h2>
<p class="normal">Considering that you<a id="_idIndexMarker902"/> are in the context of a distributed database, Azure Cosmos DB enables you to define the default read consistency level you will have. By <a id="_idIndexMarker903"/>selecting <strong class="keyWord">Default consistency</strong> in the main menu of your Cosmos DB account, you can choose the default replication consistency that you wish to apply to all your containers.</p>
<p class="normal">This default can be overridden in each container, either from Data Explorer or programmatically. Consistency problems in read/write operations are a consequence of data replication. More specifically, the results of various read operations may be incoherent if the read operations are executed on different replicas that have received different partial updates.</p>
<p class="normal">The following are the available consistency levels. These have been ordered from the weakest to the strongest:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Eventual</strong>: After enough<a id="_idIndexMarker904"/> time has passed, if no further write operations are done, all the reads converge and apply all the writes. The order of writes is also not guaranteed, so while writes are being processed, you could also end up reading an earlier version than the one you have previously read.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Consistent prefix</strong>: All the writes are executed in the same order on all the replicas. So, if there are <code class="inlineCode">n</code> write operations, each read is consistent with the result of applying the first <code class="inlineCode">m</code> writes for some <code class="inlineCode">m</code> less than or equal to <code class="inlineCode">n</code>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Session</strong>: This is the same as the consistency prefix but also guarantees that each writer sees the result of its own writes in all subsequent read operations and that subsequent reads of each reader are coherent (either the same database or a more updated version of it).</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Bounded staleness</strong>: This is associated either with a delay time, <code class="inlineCode">Delta</code>, or with several operations, <code class="inlineCode">N</code>. Each read sees the results of all the write operations that were performed before a time <code class="inlineCode">Delta</code> (or before the last <code class="inlineCode">N</code> operations). That is, its reads converge with the result of all the writes with a maximum time delay of <code class="inlineCode">Delta</code> (or a maximum operations delay of <code class="inlineCode">N</code>).</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Strong</strong>: This is bounded staleness combined with <code class="inlineCode">Delta = 0</code>. Here, each read reflects the <a id="_idIndexMarker905"/>result of all previous write operations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The strongest consistency can be obtained to the detriment of performance. By default, the consistency is set to <strong class="keyWord">Session</strong>, which is a good compromise between coherence and performance. A lower level of consistency is difficult to handle in applications and is only usually acceptable if sessions are either read-only or write-only.</p>
<p class="normal">If you select the <strong class="keyWord">Settings</strong> option in the <strong class="keyWord">Data Explorer</strong> menu of the container of your database, you can configure which paths to index and which kind of indexing to apply to each data type of <a id="_idIndexMarker906"/>each path. The configuration consists of a JSON object. Let us analyze its various properties:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">{
"indexingMode": "consistent",
"automatic": true,
    ...
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">If you set <code class="inlineCode">indexingMode</code> to <code class="inlineCode">none</code> instead of <code class="inlineCode">consistent</code>, no index is generated, and the collection can be used as a key-value dictionary that is indexed by the collection’s primary key. In this scenario, no secondary indexes are generated, so the primary key cannot efficiently be searched.</p>
<p class="normal">When <code class="inlineCode">automatic</code> is set to <code class="inlineCode">true</code>, all document properties are automatically indexed:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">{
    ...
    "includedPaths": [
{
"path": "/*",
"indexes": [
{
"kind": "Range",
"dataType": "Number",
"precision": -1
},
{
"kind": "Range",
"dataType": "String",
"precision": -1
},
{
"kind": "Spatial",
"dataType": "Point"
}
]
}
]
},
...
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Each entry in <code class="inlineCode">includedPaths</code> specifies a path pattern such as <code class="inlineCode">/subpath1/subpath2/?</code> (settings apply just to the <code class="inlineCode">/subpath1/subpath2/property</code>) or <code class="inlineCode">/subpath1/subpath2/*</code> (settings apply to all the paths starting with <code class="inlineCode">/subpath1/subpath2/</code>).</p>
<p class="normal">Patterns contain the <code class="inlineCode">[]</code> symbol when settings must be applied to child objects contained in collection properties; for example, <code class="inlineCode">/subpath1/subpath2/[]/?</code>, <code class="inlineCode">/subpath1/subpath2/[]/childpath1/?</code>, and so on. Settings specify the index type to apply to each data type (string, number, geographic point, and so on). Range indexes are needed for comparison operations, while hash indices are more efficient if we need equality comparisons.</p>
<p class="normal">It is possible to <a id="_idIndexMarker907"/>specify a precision, that is, the maximum number of characters or digits to use in all the index keys. <code class="inlineCode">-1</code> means the maximum precision and is always recommended:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">    ...
    "excludedPaths": [
{
"path": "/\"_etag\"/?"
}
]
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Paths contained in <code class="inlineCode">excludedPaths</code> are not indexed at all. Index settings can also be specified programmatically.</p>
<p class="normal">Here, you have two options to connect to Cosmos DB: use a version of its official client for your preferred programming language or use Cosmos DB’s Entity Framework Core provider. In the following subsections, we will have a look at both options. Then, we will describe how to use Cosmos DB’s Entity Framework Core provider with a practical example.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-260">The Cosmos DB client</h2>
<p class="normal">The Cosmos DB client <a id="_idIndexMarker908"/>for .NET 8 is available through the <code class="inlineCode">Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos</code> NuGet package. It offers full control of all Cosmos DB features, while the Cosmos DB Entity Framework provider is easier to use but hides some Cosmos DB peculiarities. Follow these steps to interact with Cosmos DB through the official Cosmos DB client for .NET 8.</p>
<p class="normal">The following code sample shows the creation of a database and a container using the client component. Any operation requires the creation of a client object. Do not forget that the client must be disposed of by calling its <code class="inlineCode">Dispose</code> method (or by enclosing the code that references it in a <code class="inlineCode">using</code> statement) when you do not need it anymore:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">public static async Task CreateCosmosDB()
{
    using var cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(endpoint, key);
    Database database = await
        cosmosClient.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync(databaseId);
    ContainerProperties cp = new ContainerProperties(containerId,
        "/DestinationName");
    Container container = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(cp);
    await AddItemsToContainerAsync(container);
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">During collection creation, you can pass a <code class="inlineCode">ContainerProperties</code> object, where you can specify the consistency level, how to index properties, and all the other collection features.</p>
<p class="normal">Then, you must define the .NET classes that correspond to the structure of the JSON document you need to manipulate in your collections. You can also use the <code class="inlineCode">JsonProperty</code> attribute to map class property names to JSON names if they are not equal:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">public class Destination
{
    [JsonPropertyName("id")]
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string DestinationName { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public Package[] Packages { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>
<div><p class="normal">NoSQL means Not Only SQL, so it is also possible to map properties. The great thing about NoSQL is that you must map these properties without causing damage to other properties or information you have in the document you are connecting to.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Once you have all the necessary classes, you can use client methods to <code class="inlineCode">ReadItemAsync</code>, <code class="inlineCode">CreateItemAsync</code>, and <code class="inlineCode">DeleteItemAsync</code>. You can also query data using a <code class="inlineCode">QueryDefinition</code> object<a id="_idIndexMarker909"/> that accepts SQL commands. You can find a complete introduction to this library at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-get-started">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-get-started</a>.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-261">The Cosmos DB Entity Framework Core provider</h2>
<p class="normal">The Cosmos DB<a id="_idIndexMarker910"/> provider for Entity Framework <a id="_idIndexMarker911"/>Core is contained in the <code class="inlineCode">Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos</code> NuGet package. Once you’ve added this to your project, you can proceed in a similar way to when you used the SQL Server provider in <em class="italic">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">Interacting with Data in C# – Entity Framework Core</em>, but with a few differences. Let us take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">There are no migrations since Cosmos DB databases have no structure to update. Instead, they have a method that ensures that the database, along with all the necessary collections, is created:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">context.Database.EnsureCreated();
</code></pre>
</li>
<li class="bulletList">By default, the <code class="inlineCode">DbSet&lt;T&gt;</code> properties from <code class="inlineCode">DBContext</code> are mapped to a unique container since this is the cheapest option. You can override this default by explicitly specifying which container you want to map some entities to by using the following configuration instruction:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">builder.Entity&lt;MyEntity&gt;()
     .ToContainer("collection-name");
</code></pre>
</li>
<li class="bulletList">The only useful annotation on entity classes is the <code class="inlineCode">Key</code> attribute, which becomes obligatory when the primary keys are not called <code class="inlineCode">Id</code>.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Primary keys must be strings and cannot be auto-incremented to avoid synchronization issues in a distributed environment. The uniqueness of primary keys can be ensured by generating GUIDs and transforming them into strings.</li>
<li class="bulletList">When defining relationships between entities, you can specify that an entity or a collection of entities is owned by another entity, in which case it is stored together with the parent entity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">We will look at the <a id="_idIndexMarker912"/>usage of Cosmos DB’s Entity<a id="_idIndexMarker913"/> Framework provider in the <em class="italic">How to choose your data storage in the cloud</em> section of <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 21</em>, <em class="italic">Case Study</em>.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-262">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we looked at the main storage options available in Azure and learned when to use them. Then, we compared relational and NoSQL databases. We pointed out that relational databases offer automatic consistency checking and transaction isolation, but NoSQL databases are cheaper and offer better performance, especially when distributed writes form a high percentage of the average workload.</p>
<p class="normal">Then, we described Azure’s main NoSQL option, Cosmos DB, and explained how to configure it and how to connect with a client.</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, we learned how to interact with Cosmos DB with Entity Framework Core. Here, we learned how to decide whether to use relational or NoSQL databases for all families of data involved in an application. So, you can choose the kind of data storage that ensures the best compromise between data coherence, speed, and parallel access to data in each of your applications.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will learn all about how to interact with data in C#–Entity Framework Core.</p>
