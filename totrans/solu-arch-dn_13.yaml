    DevOps. A pipeline is an automated service that's used to verify a build and make
    it ready for deployment. The usage of the pipeline will reduce the manual work
    needed from the developer to merge the code, build it, and test the changes, along
    with the affected features. It is important to mention that the pipelines are
    used in continuous delivery and continuous deployment to automate their steps.

    about branching and pull requests. Later, we learned about the packages that are
    available in Azure Artifacts, along with CI/CD, which help automate the steps
    related to building, testing, and deploying our code.

    a lot of different ideas since you've dived deep into the everyday aspects of
    solution architecture. I suggest that you start by measuring where you are on
    your journey toward becoming an effective solution architecture. A good solution
    architect helps build high-quality products that fit the existing environment,
    along with the clients' requirements. To achieve this, a solution architect must
    learn about each part of the business model and how these parts work together.

    develop a learning mindset by frequently researching and getting to know new techniques
    and patterns in solution architectures, and also focus on the cloud services offered
    by Azure for building modern solutions. At the same time, it is essential to always
    improve our soft skills, especially if we want to become effective leaders. I
    hope that you have enjoyed reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it and
    sharing my thoughts and experiences. I wish you every success in all your .NET
    projects!
