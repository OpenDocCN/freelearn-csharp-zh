After that, the company has to charge for items delivered and has to pay for services received.</p><p>The management of advanced payments, cash payments, or deferred payments is of vital importance for the company. In this chapter, we will learn how to do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Manage different payment methods such as payment registrations</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Handle incoming and outgoing payments in NAV</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Import bank reconciliation</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Managing due dates"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec15"/>Managing due dates</h1></div></div></div><p>When you start working with a new customer or vendor, you reach an agreement with them on when are invoices due. On the <span class="strong"><strong>Payments</strong></span> tab of the customer and vendor card, you select the <span class="strong"><strong>Payment Term</strong></span> tab that suits the agreement. After that, the program will automatically calculate the due date when you create an invoice.</p><div class="section" title="Payment terms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec20"/>Payment terms</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Payment Terms</strong></span> page contains one line for each set of <span class="strong"><strong>Payment Terms</strong></span> the company uses. You can create as many payment terms as you need.</p><p>Every set of payment terms must contain a <span class="strong"><strong>Due Date Calculation</strong></span> formula that the program uses together with the document date of the invoice to calculate the due date. In addition, you can also specify a <span class="strong"><strong>Discount Date Calculation</strong></span> formula and a <span class="strong"><strong>Discount %</strong></span> that will be used to calculate discounts on the basis of early payments.</p><p>Navigate to <code class="literal">Departments/Financial Management/Receivables/Setup</code> to see the full list, which is shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_02_01.jpg" alt="Payment terms"/></div><p>
</p><p>The payment term code is assigned to each customer by filling in a field called <span class="strong"><strong>Payment Terms Code</strong></span>. When a customer uses an invoice, the payment term is copied to it and the due date gets calculated based on the document date of the invoice.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_02_02.jpg" alt="Payment terms"/></div><p>
</p><p>When the invoice is posted, a customer ledger entry is created with its corresponding <span class="strong"><strong>Due Date</strong></span>. You can see the flow of data in the following diagram:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_02_03.jpg" alt="Payment terms"/></div><p>
</p><p>You can change the payment term in a particular invoice if you have reached a different agreement with the customer for this sale. You can also change the due date on the ledger entry if needed. At the end of the process, the system checks for due dates of ledger entries to claim charges from customers and to propose payments to vendors.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>On Hold</strong></span> field in the <span class="strong"><strong>Customer Ledger Entries</strong></span> tab is used to indicate that the invoice should wait for approval before the payment can be reclaimed or interest added to it. You can fill the field with your initials or any other code. The same field can be found for vendor ledger entry, to indicate that an invoice cannot be paid yet. Actually, everything explained in this section also applies to vendors.</p></div><div class="section" title="Prepayments"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec21"/>Prepayments</h2></div></div></div><p>Prepayments are payments that are invoiced and posted to a sales or purchase prepayment order before final invoicing. As per the company and item specification, you may require to make the payment before you ship items to a customer or receive goods from a vendor.</p><p>You use the prepayments functionality in Microsoft Dynamics NAV to invoice and collect deposits that are required from customers or remit deposits to vendors.</p><p>Until the final invoice has been issued, we do not have a ledger entry to base the payments on. Prepayments can be set up for customers or vendors, regardless of the items or services included in the document. You can also specify different prepayments rates for certain items. Use a 100% rate if you need to pay it all in advance.</p><p>The following are some types of prepayments:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Customer and vendor prepayments</strong></span>: You can specify a prepayment percent on the customer or vendor card in a field called <span class="strong"><strong>Prepayment %</strong></span>, which will apply to all orders.

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Item prepayments</strong></span>: Similar to how you set up prices, you can specify prepayment rates for items.

</p><p>Note that both <span class="strong"><strong>CASH</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>CREDITCARD</strong></span> have a <span class="strong"><strong>Bal. Account No.</strong></span> defined. When you post an invoice with one of the payment methods selected, the system will create and post the payment against the invoice, so you don't have to manually do it later on. This is useful when the payment is done at the same time the invoice is raised.</p><p>When you use the credit card payment method in a sales order or invoice, you have to specify which credit card will be used. Credit cards are created on the customer card, through the <span class="strong"><strong>Credit Cards - Credit Cards</strong></span> action found on the ribbon. Information commonly required for credit cards has to be filled in, such as the card type, the holder's name, the card number, and the expiry date. Once the credit card is selected, an authorization against the total invoice amount is required. This can either occur manually or automatically. When the invoice is posted, the actual payment is sent to the payment service. The payment is then captured and posted in Dynamics NAV. If it cannot be processed, an error message is displayed. In this case, the invoice is posted anyway, but the payment is not posted. It can be captured and posted later on using the <span class="strong"><strong>Cash Receipt Journal</strong></span> window.</p></div>

To do so, you use the <span class="strong"><strong>Cash Receipt Journal</strong></span> window or the <span class="strong"><strong>Payment Journal</strong></span> window. Both work the same way, but the <span class="strong"><strong>Payment Journal</strong></span> can also be used to print checks.

<div class="section" title="Bank reconciliation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec24"/>Bank reconciliation</h1></div></div></div><p>The purpose of the bank reconciliation feature is to check whether the statements your bank provides you with agree with the bank account ledger entries that you have been creating while posting payments. It helps you check whether there is any cash movement that you have not posted into the system yet. At the end of a given period, the statement ending balance must equal the balance of the bank account in Dynamics NAV.</p><p>To create a new bank account reconciliation, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <code class="literal">Departments/Financial Management/Cash Management/Bank Account Reconciliations</code> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Select the <code class="literal">WWB-OPERATING</code> code in the <span class="strong"><strong>Bank Account No.</strong></span> field.</li><li class="listitem">Select <code class="literal">03/31/2017</code> as the statement date and write <code class="literal">-600000</code> as the <span class="strong"><strong>Statement Ending Balance</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Suggest Lines...</strong></span> option from the ribbon bar and click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">New reconciliation lines are created as copies of open bank ledger entries.</li><li class="listitem">Check the reconciliation lines against the bank statement lines.</li><li class="listitem">Post the lines.<p>

</p></li></ol></div><p>In the preceding screenshot, most of the bank statement entries have been posted in the system, but the first and the last ones are missing. You can manually create them in the bank reconciliation and use the <span class="strong"><strong>Transfer to General Journal...</strong></span> action to transfer them to the corresponding journal, complete the transaction there, and post them.</p><p>Once the missing statement lines are posted, from the bank reconciliation page use the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply Entries</strong></span> actions to select new bank ledger entries to be applied against the manually created bank reconciliation lines.</p><p>And finally, post the bank reconciliation using the <span class="strong"><strong>Post</strong></span> action found on the ribbon. Once a reconciliation is posted, its ending balance will become the initial balance of the next statement.</p></div>
