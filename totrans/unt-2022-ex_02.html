<h1 id="_idParaDest-17" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor016" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Foundational Knowledge of Unity 2022</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Getting started in Unity 2022 is easy with <strong class="bold">Unity Hub</strong>. Unity Hub serves a few very useful purposes, and we’ll be going through installing it and learning about its features. In this chapter, we’ll not only install Unity Hub and the <strong class="bold">Unity Editor</strong>, but we’ll also break down the different templates that are available to kickstart your game and <span>AR/VR projects.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In addition to templates that provide a starting foundation for your new project, Unity also provides added functionality through the Package Manager. The Package Manager allows Unity to give a small project size footprint and not bloat the Editor with a default installation of unneeded or unwanted tooling (referring to relatively simple add-on programs that combine to accomplish a task). Being familiar with and understanding what packages are available will surely help save time and increase the quality of <span>your project.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Finding your way around the Unity Editor is only half an introduction. The second half of this chapter teaches you how to create content and make things interactable. We’ll do this by first creating a simple 2D character right in the Editor using built-in tooling. This all starts with the <strong class="bold">GameObject</strong> – Unity’s <span>building block.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The book takes a project-based approach to learning, so we’ll walk through designing a game, creating a game, and solving problems along <span>the way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following <span>main topics.</span></p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><a id="_idTextAnchor017" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Unity Hub – choosing the <strong class="bold">2D Universal Render Pipeline (</strong><span><strong class="bold">URP) template</strong></span></li>
<li class="calibre15">Getting to know the Unity Editor and <span>installing packages</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">Introducing the GameObject! All about the <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> <span>and </span><span><strong class="bold">components</strong></span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">2D Sprites</strong> with <strong class="bold">Sprite Creator</strong> – understanding the <strong class="bold">Sprite Renderer</strong> and <span>draw ordering</span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Game Design Document</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDD</strong>) – introducing the 2D <span>collection game</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to create a new Unity project, be comfortable finding your way around the Unity Editor, understand the initial criteria for a game design document, and be prepared to create the <strong class="bold">2D Sprite</strong>-based character that is the first element of <span>our game.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-18" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor018" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="calibre3">To follow along in this chapter, you’ll need a computer with Windows 7+ 64-bit, Mac OS X 10.12+, or Linux (Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, and CentOS 7) running. You’ll need sufficient free hard drive space for not only the Unity Editor installation but also the project files. We recommend 25 GB for the Unity install folder, with 3 GB of free space for the installation temp files (the temp files are usually located on your OS installation drive), and 10 GB should be sufficient for the <span>project files.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-19" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor019" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Unity Hub – Choosing the 2D URP template</h1>
<p class="calibre3">The Unity Hub <a id="_idIndexMarker000" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>makes it simple<a id="_idIndexMarker001" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> to manage the installed Unity Editor versions and add or remove modules for installed Editors, and it helps manage your different projects. If you’re entirely new to Unity, then that previous sentence might be a bit confusing. Why would we have to manage different installed Editors? Simply put, software changes. As the Unity Editor evolves, it introduces new features and changes to its <span>scripting API.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">As a general rule of thumb, you should not upgrade the Unity Editor version for your project once you’ve started production. Doing so can have undesirable effects, such as broken renderings or code that no longer compiles. We’ll discuss this more in the following sections when installing the Unity Editor and selecting our <span>project template.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor020" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Installing Unity Hub</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s get started on<a id="_idIndexMarker002" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> our journey by first getting Unity Hub installed. We’ll be<a id="_idIndexMarker003" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> using the <strong class="bold">Unity Personal</strong> license throughout this book, which is the free version of Unity. Free here doesn’t mean we will be limited in features or capabilities in building our games. It just means you are only allowed to use this version for free if you fall under the criteria for requiring a paid license (if you earned less than $100K of revenue or funds raised in the last <span>12 months).</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">If you are an eligible student, you may want to check<a id="_idIndexMarker004" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> out the <strong class="bold">Unity Student plan</strong> at <a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-student" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://unity.com/products/unity-student</a>. It provides access to <strong class="bold">Unity Pro</strong>, a <a id="_idIndexMarker005" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>selection <a id="_idIndexMarker006" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>of quality assets, and <strong class="bold">Unity Gaming Services</strong>, such<a id="_idIndexMarker007" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> as <strong class="bold">Cloud Build</strong>, that professionals and studios building games use <span>on Unity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Okay, let’s do this. Perform the following steps to install the <span>Unity Hub:</span></p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">Go to <a href="https://unity.com/download" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6">https://unity.com/download</a> and select the download link for your OS. This will download <strong class="source-inline">UnityHubSetup.exe</strong> to your <span><strong class="source-inline">Downloads</strong></span><span> folder.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">Click on the executable from your web browser, navigate to your <strong class="source-inline">Downloads</strong> folder, and double-click the executable to launch <span>the installation.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">Keep the defaults or change the installation path if you want to install to a different hard drive location (only use local drives and not network drives, as this could <span>cause problems).</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">After clicking <strong class="bold">Install</strong> and letting the installation process complete, click <strong class="bold">Finish</strong> to run <span>Unity Hub.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">When opening Unity Hub for the first time, you will be prompted to <strong class="bold">Sign in</strong> or <strong class="bold">Create account</strong> if you have not created one already. Your Unity account, known <a id="_idIndexMarker008" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>as <strong class="bold">Unity ID</strong>, will be used for licensing. Unity requires an active license to install the Unity Editor. The Personal Edition license is free, and Unity Hub will generate one <span>for you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">With Unity Hub now installed, let’s continue installing the <span>Unity Editor.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-21" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor021" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Installing the Unity Editor – What version?</h2>
<p class="calibre3">We have a <a id="_idIndexMarker009" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>new installation of Unity Hub and are now<a id="_idIndexMarker010" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> ready to install a Unity Editor version. As previously mentioned, Unity Hub allows you to have multiple versions of the Unity Editor installed to manage the different projects you’ll create over time. Opening Unity Hub without any Editor version installed will default to prompting<a id="_idIndexMarker011" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> the latest Unity Editor version in the <strong class="bold">LTS</strong> stream to be installed. LTS simply means <strong class="bold">long-term support</strong>. This is usually the best version choice to lock in and base a new project on because it will be the most stable version available and is guaranteed to be supported for the next two years. To ensure stability with the LTS version, no new features are added to the tooling or scripting API. If you want to create with the latest engine features, you’ll have to choose one of the <a id="_idIndexMarker012" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>newer <strong class="bold">tech streams</strong> since no additional tools or technologies will be introduced in the <span>LTS stream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Okay, simply stated, what does <span>this mean?</span></p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15">If you’re starting production today or about to ship, and you desire stability and support over the lifetime of your development and release cycle, choose the LTS stream. At the time of writing, this is <span>2020.3 LTS.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">If you’re starting production today but want to leverage newer tools and technology, and the latest official release version is close to becoming the new LTS stream, choose the latest official release version. At the time of writing, this is 2021.2 (becoming the latest LTS stream when 2021.3 is <span>officially released).</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">If you want to create on the cutting edge of the tools and technology available and don’t mind managing potential crashes and bugs, then choose the latest pre-release (<span>beta) version.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">This book is written specifically for Unity 2022. If you have an earlier version of Unity already installed, then the instructions or features may differ, so it may be difficult – or impossible – to follow along. We recommend installing the latest version of Unity 2022 to complete the projects we’ll create in the <span>following chapters.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">To gauge your production schedule against the Unity LTS releases, refer to the <span>following timeline:</span></p>
<div class="calibre2">
<div class="img---figure" id="_idContainer009">
<img alt="Figure 1.1 – Unity platform release timeline" src="image/B18347_01_01.jpg" class="calibre18"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – Unity platform release timeline</p>
<p class="calibre3">Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker013" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>provides <a id="_idIndexMarker014" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>detailed LTS release information on <a id="_idIndexMarker015" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>the <strong class="bold">Unity QA</strong> resources page <span>at </span><a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"><span>https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Proceed to install the Unity 2022 Editor with the <span>following steps:</span></p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">If you’ve just finished installing Unity Hub, you’ll be prompted to install the latest LTS version of the Unity Editor. We want to install a Unity 2022 release specifically, so proceed by clicking <strong class="bold">Skip installation</strong> in the lower-right corner of the dialog, unless, at the time you’re reading this, the 2022 LTS version has been released, in which case you can just install it and skip the <span>remaining steps!</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">In the main Unity Hub window, select <strong class="bold">Installs</strong> in the <span>left-side pane.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">Click the <strong class="bold">Install Editor</strong> button in the window’s <span>top-right corner.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">The <strong class="bold">Official releases</strong> tab should be selected by default (the latest beta versions can be found under the <span><strong class="bold">Pre-releases</strong></span><span> tab).</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">In the <strong class="bold">OTHER VERSIONS</strong> section below the <strong class="bold">LONG TERM SUPPORT (LTS)</strong> section, find the latest 2022 release version listed and <span>click </span><span><strong class="bold">Install</strong></span><span>.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">The next screen you’ll be presented with is selecting the dev tools, platforms, and documentation modules. Since we’re assuming you’re installing Unity for the first time, and we don’t currently have any specific requirements for our first project, we’ll just keep the defaults. Click <span>on </span><span><strong class="bold">Continue</strong></span><span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Unity Hub will now download and install the selected version. Depending on your internet connection and hard drive speed, this will take a bit of time – an average base installation requires roughly 3 GB of downloads (temporary files) and approximately 7 GB of free hard drive space <span>for installation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In this<a id="_idIndexMarker016" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> section, we learned about the different Unity<a id="_idIndexMarker017" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> Editor versions available and how to install them. In the next section, we’ll learn about render pipelines to determine how to proceed with a <span>new project.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-22" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor022" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>What is a render pipeline?</h2>
<p class="calibre3">In the next <a id="_idIndexMarker018" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>section, when<a id="_idIndexMarker019" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> we create our project, we’ll select a template to base our project on. This requires a bit of explanation to understand the templates’ options fully. We’ll create a 2D game (a two-dimensional game represented by planar images), so selecting a 2D template makes sense, but these are the available template names for 2D: <strong class="bold">2D</strong>, <strong class="bold">2D (URP)</strong>, and <strong class="bold">2D Mobile</strong>. We won’t be creating a mobile game, so we can rule out <strong class="bold">2D Mobile</strong>, but what does <strong class="bold">(</strong><span><strong class="bold">URP)</strong></span><span> mean?</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">If you’re unfamiliar with how video games work under the hood, <strong class="bold">rendering</strong> refers to how the 2D graphics or 3D models are drawn to the screen to generate an image. Over time, as Unity evolved its rendering technology to better suit the types of games creators were making, they understood the need to make changes and improve the rendering technology. A performant and customizable render pipeline architecture was introduced to serve creators best<a id="_idIndexMarker020" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> called a <strong class="bold">Scriptable Render Pipeline</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRP</strong>). The template named <strong class="bold">2D</strong> will use Unity’s <strong class="bold">built-in renderer</strong>, whereas <strong class="bold">2D (URP)</strong> will <a id="_idIndexMarker021" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>use the <strong class="bold">Universal Render Pipeline</strong> (<strong class="bold">Universal RP</strong>, or <strong class="bold">URP</strong>). The<a id="_idIndexMarker022" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> Universal RP is a default SRP Unity provides as a starting basis for making performant games on the broadest device platforms – this will eventually replace the built-in legacy renderer as <span>the default.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">We’ll discuss the URP feature set relevant to adding renderer features to the projects throughout the book but not compare it directly with the built-in renderer features. A feature comparison table between URP and the built-in renderer can be found at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal%407.1/manual/universalrp-builtin-feature-comparison.xhtml" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"><span>https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal%407.1/manual/universalrp-builtin-feature-comparison.xhtml</span></a></p>
<p class="calibre3">This section<a id="_idIndexMarker023" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> taught you what a render pipeline is and how to select the correct 2D project<a id="_idIndexMarker024" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> template. Now you’ll use what you learned to create our <span>first project!</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-23" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor023" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Creating a project</h2>
<p class="calibre3">We’ll be <a id="_idIndexMarker025" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>creating our project from scratch using one of the templates Unity Hub provides to make sure everything is set up correctly for our game’s rendering requirements. Since we’ll start by creating a 2D game, we’ll select the <strong class="bold">2D (URP) Core</strong> template. Core means that the template won’t provide any example assets, samples, or learning content in this context. It will give an empty 2D project with a pre-configured URP 2D renderer setup – perfect, just what <span>we need!</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Proceed with the following steps to create a new 2D URP project in <span>Unity Hub:</span></p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">With <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> selected in the left-side pane, click the <strong class="bold">New project</strong> button in the window’s <span>top-right corner.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">Verify that the Editor version at the top of the window is set to the installed <span>2022 version.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">Find the <strong class="bold">2D (URP)</strong> template in the list and click to <span>select it.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">Next, in the right-side pane, give your project a name by entering it in the <strong class="bold">Project </strong><span><strong class="bold">name</strong></span><span> field.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">And finally, verify the installation path in the <strong class="bold">Location</strong> field, then click on <span><strong class="bold">Create project</strong></span><span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Now you can create your project with the preceding steps while referring to the following screenshot (making sure to have the correct <strong class="bold">Editor version</strong> selected at the top in case you have multiple versions <span>installed already):</span></p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2 – Unity Hub project templates</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, you<a id="_idIndexMarker026" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> learned how to install the Unity Hub and installed a specific version of the Unity Editor. Then, you learned what a render pipeline is and how that relates to creating a new project. We’ll continue discussing the Unity Editor now by introducing its <span>main features.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-24" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor024" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Getting to know the Unity Editor and installing packages</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Having just created a<a id="_idIndexMarker027" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> new 2D URP project and opened up the Editor, let’s take a tour of<a id="_idIndexMarker028" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> the Unity 2022 interface! We’ll cover only the most common features in this section and dig deeper into the features of the specific windows and toolbars as we work through our projects in the later chapters, providing the information in the context of the <span>required task.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">When we open the Unity Editor for the first time, it will use the default Windows layout, as shown in the <span>following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="calibre2">
<div class="img---figure" id="_idContainer011">
<img alt="Figure 1.3 – The Unity 2022 Editor default layout" src="image/B18347_01_03.jpg" class="calibre20"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3 – The Unity 2022 Editor default layout</p>
<p class="calibre3">The common Editor windows that you’ll be using most of the time are <span>the following:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Scene</strong> – this is the window where we build our content visually. Objects added to the <strong class="bold">Scene Hierarchy</strong> with renderer components will be visible in the scene and <span>game views.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Game</strong> – the simulation you see in the game view represents what players will see rendered in your final playable distribution builds. You will also playtest your game in this window when <a id="_idIndexMarker029" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>entering <span><strong class="bold">Play Mode</strong></span><span>.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Project</strong> – the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window is comparable to your OS’s file manager. It’s where you’ll import and organize the files that make up the <strong class="bold">Assets</strong> for the project you’re creating (such as 3D models, 2D images, sounds &amp; music, plugins, and <span>so on).</span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> – this is the scene’s <strong class="bold">GameObject Hierarchy</strong> (more on GameObjects in the next section). Understanding how to organize your scene’s objects in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window (as in parent-child relationships) will be essential to work on your projects effectively, so this will be a topic of discussion in the <span>coming chapters.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> – in the natural order of things in Unity, the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window comes next as it’s tied directly to the GameObjects’ in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window. When an object is selected in the <strong class="bold">Scene Hierarchy</strong>, the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> shows all its details (<strong class="bold">Transform</strong> <span>and components).</span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Console</strong> – information, warnings, errors, and any relevant trace information are displayed in a list view that can be sorted and filtered. Debugging any problems occurring in your project will be performed from the <strong class="bold">Console</strong> <span>information displayed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Note that in the <a id="_idIndexMarker030" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>default <a id="_idIndexMarker031" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>layout, clicking on a tab, such as <strong class="bold">Game</strong> or <strong class="bold">Console</strong> in <span><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em>, will bring it to the “front” for interaction. Tabs can also be dragged and docked to other windows to provide a fully <span>customized layout.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In addition to these windows, Unity also has some toolbars, such as <span>the following:</span></p>
<div class="calibre2">
<div class="img---figure" id="_idContainer012">
<img alt="Figure 1.4 – The Unity 2022 Editor toolbars" src="image/B18347_01_04.jpg" class="calibre21"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4 – The Unity 2022 Editor toolbars</p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Main Toolbar</strong> (<em class="italic">A</em>) – the buttons on the upper left provide access to your <strong class="bold">Unity Account</strong> (Unity ID), <strong class="bold">Unity Cloud Services</strong>, and<a id="_idIndexMarker032" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> the current <strong class="bold">version control system</strong> (<strong class="bold">VCS</strong>) (we’ll tackle <a id="_idIndexMarker033" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>version control in a later chapter). The centered buttons are the play (for entering <strong class="bold">Play Mode</strong>), pause, and step controls. On the right side, the buttons are <strong class="bold">Undo History</strong>, <strong class="bold">Global Search</strong>, the <strong class="bold">Layers Visibility</strong> dropdown, and finally, the <strong class="bold">Editor Layout</strong> dropdown (as noted earlier, we’re looking at the default window layout; you can change the layout using one of the presets or save <span>your own).</span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Scene Toolbar</strong> (<em class="italic">B</em>) – the tools, starting on the left <span>side, are:</span><ul class="calibre22"><li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Tool Handle Position</strong> (Center, Pivot) – when moving objects in the scene, the action will<a id="_idIndexMarker034" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> be <a id="_idIndexMarker035" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>based on this position, either the Center of the object or the <span>object’s Pivot.</span></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">If the <strong class="bold">Anchor</strong> position<a id="_idIndexMarker036" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> of your GameObject in the scene View doesn’t look correct, don’t forget to check <span>this setting!</span></p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Tool Handle Rotation</strong> (Global, Local) – when rotating objects in the scene, they rotate relative to their Transform in <strong class="bold">Global</strong> or <span><strong class="bold">Local</strong></span><span> space.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">You may need to change between Global or Local space settings to rotate an object correctly. If your rotations don’t look correct, don’t forget to check <span>this setting!</span></p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15">The remainder of the tools include grid visibility and snapping settings, <strong class="bold">Draw Mode</strong>, 2D or <a id="_idIndexMarker037" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>3D scene View (we are currently in 2D), toggles for scene lighting, audio, effects, hidden objects, scene View camera settings, and Gizmos. There’s a lot to unpack here, but don’t worry, we’ll touch on these as we work through the projects we’ll be creating in the <span>coming chapters.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Manipulation Tools Toolbar</strong> (<em class="italic">C</em>) – a floating toolbar, also known as <strong class="bold">Overlays</strong>, within the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> window. This toolbar provides the essential tools for working with GameObjects within the scene View. The tools include View, Move, Rotate, Scale, Rect, <span>and Transform.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">One more “toolbar” along the bottom of the Editor window is called<a id="_idIndexMarker038" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> the <strong class="bold">Status bar</strong> (not pictured). The Status bar mostly provides the current status of specific processes, such as the last <strong class="bold">Console</strong> warning or error message (left-side), the progress of lighting generation (right-side), and the code compilation <span>spinner (right-corner).</span></p>

<p class="callout">You can find more information on Unity’s interface <span>at </span><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheEditor.xhtml" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"><span>https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheEditor.xhtml</span></a></p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, you learned about the familiar Editor windows and toolbars and how they can<a id="_idIndexMarker039" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> manipulate<a id="_idIndexMarker040" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> objects in the scene View. Let’s see how we can extend the features and tooling in the Editor now <span>with Packages.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-25" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor025" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>The Unity Package Manager</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Without<a id="_idIndexMarker041" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> knowing, you were already introduced to packages earlier when we discussed the Universal RP. Since we started with a URP template, we didn’t have to do anything special, but Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker042" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>provides <strong class="bold">Scriptable Render Pipeline</strong> support through packages! Packages provide a way for Unity to offer multiple versions of an engine feature or service without requiring a new installation of the Editor. You can even try out the latest pre-release version of a package to stay on the cutting edge of the technology and quickly revert to a stable or alternate version should you encounter any problems. The Package Manager is accessible from the top menu: <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <span><strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong></span><span>.</span></p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.5 – The Unity Package Manager</p>
<p class="calibre3">Feature sets in the <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong> are bundles of common tooling that provide a simpler and more<a id="_idIndexMarker043" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> streamlined install experience. The <strong class="bold">2D</strong> feature set (selected in <span><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em>) is for creators working with 2D projects. In our case, again, having started from the <strong class="bold">2D URP</strong> template, the <strong class="bold">2D</strong> feature set has already been imported to our project (indicated by the green checkmark). We’re good <span>to go!</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Should you need to make any changes to the packages in your project, from the dropdown in the <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong> top menu, you can see what packages are available from what is already in your project via <strong class="bold">In Project</strong>, or either the <strong class="bold">Unity Registry</strong> or <strong class="bold">My Assets</strong> (which are assets you’ve purchased in the Unity Asset Store) selections. Managing a package is as simple as selecting it in the list and choosing an available function from the buttons displayed in the bottom-right window. For example, <strong class="bold">Download</strong>, <strong class="bold">Install</strong>, <strong class="bold">Remove</strong>, <span>or </span><span><strong class="bold">Update</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">Packages are project-specific, so you will need to ensure you have the desired packages installed for each new project <span>you create!</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">New to Unity 2022</p>
<p class="callout">In the <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong> window, you can now multi-select packages in the list for adding, updating, or removing in a <span>single operation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, you learned about the Editor windows and toolbars and how to add/remove features <a id="_idIndexMarker044" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>and tooling with packages that extend the Editor’s capabilities. Next, we’ll start learning about <span>the GameObject.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-26" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor026" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Introducing the GameObject – All about Transform and components</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Simply put, anything<a id="_idIndexMarker045" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> you want to add to your scene will be added as a GameObject. The GameObject is the base building block for everything that exists in a scene. It also acts as a container for adding functionality with components. When a GameObject is added to the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong>, is it active by default but can be deactivated – “turning off” all components added to it – with the checkbox to the left of the name field (to the left of <strong class="bold">Main Camera</strong> in <span><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em>). A component can be for either visual or functional purposes, or in some cases, both! Functional components implement Unity’s scripting API, and Unity provides components for supporting the engine’s many features. You’ll create custom component scripts using the C# language, which will be covered in <a href="B18347_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, you will learn how GameObjects are added to a scene, then you’ll be introduced to the Transform component, and you’ll learn how to work <span>with components.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-27" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor027" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Adding GameObjects to the scene</h2>
<p class="calibre3">New empty GameObjects<a id="_idIndexMarker046" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> and objects of a specific type are easily added to the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> with the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> menu. The <strong class="bold">Create</strong> menu is easily accessible from Unity’s top menu under GameObject, from the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window directly with the <strong class="bold">+</strong> (plus sign) icon dropdown menu at the top, or by right-clicking anywhere in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window. GameObjects in the form of <strong class="bold">Prefabs</strong> and other supported types can be added to the scene View directly by dragging and dropping from the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window – this is often the quickest way to accomplish some tasks, and we’ll be exploiting this <a id="_idIndexMarker047" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>feature while building the <span>book’s projects.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-28" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor028" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>The Transform component</h2>
<p class="calibre3">GameObjects added <a id="_idIndexMarker048" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>to the scene have a default Transform component that dictates its <strong class="bold">Position</strong>, <strong class="bold">Rotation</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> in 3D space – a Cartesian coordinate system using three mutually perpendicular coordinate axes with Y-Up, namely X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis. Positioning graphics in the scene can be performed by either manipulating the Transform manually (by typing in values), with the <strong class="bold">Manipulation Tools</strong> (clicking and dragging in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> window), or through code by using the Unity scripting API to access the GameObject’s <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> properties <span>and methods.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In the following screenshot, we can see the <strong class="bold">Main Camera</strong> GameObject’s <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> and how the <strong class="bold">Position</strong> value (<strong class="source-inline">Vector3</strong>) is represented in <span>3D space:</span></p>
<div class="calibre2">
<div class="img---figure" id="_idContainer014">
<img alt="Figure 1.6 – Inspector Transform and related 3D coordinate system" src="image/B18347_01_06.jpg" class="calibre24"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.6 – Inspector Transform and related 3D coordinate system</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the preceding figure, we can see that the <strong class="bold">Main Camera</strong> (a GameObject) in the scene was selected in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> because its name is stated at the top of the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window. The following section under that is the GameObject’s <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> values indicating that <strong class="bold">Main Camera</strong> is sitting -10 units on the Z-axis from the origin (<strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> where all axes intersect). The <strong class="bold">Rotation</strong> values on all axes are at 0, meaning no rotation is applied to this GameObject. Similarly, the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> value on all axes is at 1, meaning no scaling is applied to the default scale of this GameObject. We’ll modify these values in context while creating our player character graphics in the <em class="italic">2D sprites with Sprite Creator – Understanding the Sprite Renderer and draw </em><span><em class="italic">ordering</em></span><span> section.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Before creating<a id="_idIndexMarker049" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> our player, let’s discuss components in more detail since we’ll be directly working <span>with them.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-29" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor029" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Components</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Below the <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> section, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker050" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>see several components already added that provide functionality for the GameObject’s purpose as our scene’s main camera (cameras in our <strong class="bold">Scene Hierarchy</strong> determine what the player sees rendered in the game view). To add more functionality to this camera, click the <strong class="bold">Add Component</strong> button at the bottom of the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window. You’ll be presented with a filtered and searchable list of available components to add. The components will include not only the ones provided by Unity, such as the <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> component in <span><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em>, but also any scripts you’ve already created and added to the project. In the next chapter, we’ll tackle creating our scripts and adding them <span>as components.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Components can be added, removed, and copied/pasted, and their values can be copied/pasted and even saved as presets! This is all accomplished via the <strong class="bold">Component</strong> header section. Click and hold the header to manually reposition a component up/down in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window or right-click for moving and other functions. All of the aforementioned functions are accessible either through the right-click dialog popup or the icons on the right side of the component header; those are <strong class="bold">Reference</strong>, <strong class="bold">Presets</strong>, and a vertical ellipsis equivalent to right-clicking in <span>the title.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Components add powerful features to your projects, but things come together even more when components combine and work together with other components. Unity is based <a id="_idIndexMarker051" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>on this <strong class="bold">component architecture</strong>. We will be diving into how to structure your projects best to leverage Unity components in a well-structured single-responsibility design pattern that is easy to work with and friendly for both designers and developers <span>to use.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, you learned about the importance of components and how to work with them in <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>. We’ll be<a id="_idIndexMarker052" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> working with components throughout the book, starting with the <strong class="bold">Sprite Renderer</strong> in the <span>next section.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-30" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor030" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>2D sprites with Sprite Creator – Understanding the Sprite Renderer and draw ordering</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s dig right in<a id="_idIndexMarker053" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> and <a id="_idIndexMarker054" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>put into practice what we just learned about GameObjects by creating a simple sprite-based character we’ll be using as the player in a collection game. This will be our first project in the book! We’ll make the<a id="_idIndexMarker055" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> player character from scratch using Unity’s built-in <strong class="bold">Sprite </strong><span><strong class="bold">Creator</strong></span><span> graphics.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, we’ll create a new scene, add sprites, and learn how to manipulate and layer sprites together to make our <span>player character.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-31" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor031" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Creating a new scene</h2>
<p class="calibre3">First, let’s create a<a id="_idIndexMarker056" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> new scene by going to <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Scene</strong> (or using the <em class="italic">Ctrl/Cmd + N</em> shortcut). This will open the <strong class="bold">New Scene</strong> dialog and prompt us to select a <strong class="bold">Scene Template</strong>. We’re going to be using the <strong class="bold">Lit 2D (URP)</strong> template since we’ll be working with 2D while also using the Universal RP, and we want to take advantage of all the advanced lighting features <span>URP offers.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">When the scene opens, it’s good practice to save it immediately! Save it now by going to <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Save</strong> (or by pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl/Cmd + S</em>), selecting a folder in your project (usually <strong class="source-inline1">Assets/Scenes</strong>), and giving it a descriptive name. Now, anytime you make changes and want to save your progress, simply use the <em class="italic">Ctrl/Cmd + S</em> shortcut to save. You’ll want to do this regularly and make it a habit – crashes occur when you least expect it, and you don’t want to lose any significant progress that will have to <span>be recreated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">With our new scene being created, let’s add <span>some sprites!</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-32" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor032" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Creating a sprite using Sprite Creator</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Next, create a<a id="_idIndexMarker057" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> sprite in our scene using the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> menu by right-clicking within the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window (or using the <strong class="bold">+</strong> dropdown at the top of the window) and then going to <strong class="bold">2D Objects</strong> | <strong class="bold">Sprites</strong> | <strong class="bold">Circle</strong>. You should now have a circle visible in your scene View placed at the origin position of <strong class="source-inline">(0</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, <span><strong class="source-inline">0</strong></span><span>). Yay!</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s parent this to a new empty GameObject to create our player object with a good structure – separating the graphics from the functionality we’ll add as components to the root GameObject. We’ll do this by performing the <span>following steps:</span></p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li class="calibre15">Create a new empty GameObject by, again, right-clicking within the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window (or using the <strong class="bold">+</strong> dropdown at the top of the window) and then selecting <strong class="bold">Create Empty</strong>. Newly created GameObjects will be positioned at the origin position of <strong class="source-inline">(0</strong>, <span><strong class="source-inline">0</strong></span><span>, </span><span><strong class="source-inline">0</strong></span><span>).</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">The default name of a new GameObject, as you guessed it, is<strong class="bold"> GameObject</strong>. It is highlighted for editing by default, so you can easily rename it without additional steps. We’ll use the default name for now, so hit the <span><em class="italic">Enter</em></span><span> key.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">Create another new GameObject, but this time name <span>it </span><span><strong class="source-inline">Graphics</strong></span><span>.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">Now, we’ll set up the player character’s GameObject structure by drag and drop. First, click and drag the <strong class="bold">Circle</strong> object to <strong class="bold">Graphics</strong>, then click and drag the <strong class="bold">Graphics</strong> object <span>to </span><span><strong class="bold">GameObject</strong></span><span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">We could have saved a few steps by first selecting the <strong class="bold">Circle</strong> GameObject in the <strong class="bold">Scene Hierarchy</strong>, right-clicking on it to open the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> menu, then selecting <strong class="bold">Create Empty Parent</strong>. The previous process was essential to demonstrate how GameObjects in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window can be parented and moved to other positions in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong>. To give this a try now, undo the parenting by going to <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> | <strong class="bold">Undo</strong> (or <em class="italic">Ctrl/Cmd + Z</em>) and then redo the parenting of <span>the GameObjects.</span></p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="5" class="calibre15">Finally, rename the root object from <strong class="source-inline">GameObject</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">Player</strong>. First, select it in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window and press the <em class="italic">F2</em> (Windows) or <em class="italic">Enter</em> (Mac) key. Alternatively, with the chosen item in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong>, use the name field at the top of the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window to rename it. You should end up with the following sprite and GameObject setup in <span>your scene:</span></li>

<p class="calibre3">You learned how to <a id="_idIndexMarker058" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>add a sprite shape to your scene and understand the parenting of GameObjects to create a good structure. Before tapping fully into your arcane artistic talents to create our player character, knowing how to get around in the scene View first will surely <span>be beneficial.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-33" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor033" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Navigating the scene View</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Moving around in<a id="_idIndexMarker059" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> the scene <strong class="bold">View</strong> will help your drawing efforts by zooming in/out on details and focusing on the part you’re working on. While in <strong class="bold">2D Mode</strong>, you’ll exclusively be using both panning <span>and zooming:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Pan</strong> the scene View around by pressing the right-mouse button, using the <strong class="bold">View Tool</strong> (“hand” icon in the <strong class="bold">Toolbar Overlay</strong>) by clicking and dragging, or you can also use the keyboard by pressing the <span>arrow keys.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15"><strong class="bold">Zoom</strong> in/out of the scene View by scrolling the <span>mouse wheel.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">Additionally, you can bring focus on an object in the scene View by double-clicking it in the <span><strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong></span><span> window.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre3">We’re all set to<a id="_idIndexMarker060" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> start building our character in the <span>next section.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-34" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor034" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Creating our player character</h2>
<p class="calibre3">We will create a ladybug <a id="_idIndexMarker061" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>for the player character in our collection game project. We’ll use <strong class="bold">Sprite Creator</strong> sprites to design our character right inside the Unity Editor! In a later chapter, we’ll be importing original art assets to use as the different sprites in the game. For now, we’ll be limited to using some basic shapes to build out our character design, but with some creativity, the results can look quite lovely. The Transform values for <strong class="bold">Position</strong>, <strong class="bold">Rotation</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> and their corresponding <strong class="bold">Manipulation Tools</strong> (<strong class="bold">Toolbar Overlay</strong>) will be used extensively to draw <span>our character.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">Placeholder graphics created by a programmer during early development – and in some cases, before an artist has finalized artwork – are commonly referred to as “programmer art.” This term is sometimes used negatively to indicate mediocre artwork, but don’t let that stop you from being creative! Games such as Geometry Dash, 140, and VVVVVV all use simple graphics to <span>great effect.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s start by selecting the <strong class="bold">Circle</strong> object (that we previously created) in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window (or double-clicking to bring it into focus in the scene View) – note that we’ll want to keep all our new sprites as children of the <strong class="bold">Graphics</strong> object in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> (as seen in <span><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.8</em>). This will be the ladybug’s body, so let’s give it a nice <span>red color.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The <strong class="bold">Sprite Renderer</strong> component <a id="_idIndexMarker062" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>has a field for color just below the <strong class="bold">Sprite</strong> field that indicates we’re using the <strong class="bold">Circle</strong> sprite shape. Clicking the color will pop up the <strong class="bold">Color Picker</strong> dialog (see <span><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.8</em>). When you have a nice shade of red selected – as indicated in the top-right corner of the dialog – simply click the close button in the dialog’s title bar (<span>the </span><span><strong class="bold">x</strong></span><span>).</span></p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.8 – The Ladybug Sprite Renderer component and the Color Picker dialog</p>
<p class="calibre3">With our body sprite<a id="_idIndexMarker063" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> having a nice shade of red, we can now shape it by manipulating its <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> in the <span>next section.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-35" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor035" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Using Manipulation Tools</h2>
<p class="calibre3">In <span><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.8</em>, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker064" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> see that we’ve already <a id="_idIndexMarker065" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>gone ahead and finished our ladybug character design. Let’s walk through the process of creating it now. You should have a red circle in your scene View, but it needs to be… less circular. Let’s turn it into an ellipse by scaling it on its Y-axis. This can be accomplished by either typing in a value in the <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> | <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> | <strong class="bold">Y</strong> field or adjusting manually using the <strong class="bold">Rect Tool</strong> (selected in the <strong class="bold">Toolbar Overlay</strong> in <span><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.8</em>, and <strong class="bold">Scale Tool</strong> may also <span>be used).</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">The 2D scene View is represented by the X and Y axes for horizontal and vertical values, respectively. The Z-axis would represent <a id="_idIndexMarker066" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>depth, but in <strong class="bold">2D Mode</strong>, we won’t be manipulating the Z-axis value and <a id="_idIndexMarker067" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>will be<a id="_idIndexMarker068" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> using <strong class="bold">Sprite Sorting</strong> and <strong class="bold">Ordering </strong><span><strong class="bold">in Layers</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">While manipulating manually with the <strong class="bold">Rect Tool</strong>, click and drag on the edge (1 axis) or corner (2 axes) of the box surrounding the <strong class="bold">Circle</strong> object to <span>resize it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Two modifier keys that can help create shapes more easily are the <em class="italic">Shift</em> and <em class="italic">Alt</em> keys – but keep the keys pressed while dragging, do not press them before <span>doing so.</span></p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15">To maintain the current aspect ratio while scaling, hold down the <em class="italic">Shift</em> key <span>while dragging.</span></li>
<li class="calibre15">To scale an object equally on both sides from the center pivot, hold down the <em class="italic">Alt</em> key <span>while dragging.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">You can hold both the <em class="italic">Shift</em> and <em class="italic">Alt</em> keys down while manipulating <span>an object.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">When you have a body shape that looks good, let’s move on by creating an outline for it. An outline will help provide a good separation of our player character from the background environment. With the <strong class="bold">Circle</strong> object still selected (you can simply click on shapes in the scene View to select them), press <em class="italic">Ctrl/Cmd + D</em> to duplicate it. This will create a copy of the <strong class="bold">Circle</strong> sprite and append a number incrementally to the name for every duplicate<a id="_idIndexMarker069" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> made. Set the new shape’s <a id="_idIndexMarker070" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>color to black and scale it up uniformly to be slightly larger than the red circle. While performing this action, you’ll likely realize that we now have a problem – the black shape hides the red body. Let’s <span>fix it.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-36" class="calibre8"><a id="_idTextAnchor036" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Sprite Layers and Ordering</h2>
<p class="calibre3">In <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>, <strong class="bold">Additional Settings</strong> is a section within the <strong class="bold">Sprite Renderer</strong> component. If <a id="_idIndexMarker071" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>the <strong class="bold">Sorting Layer</strong> and <strong class="bold">Order in Layer</strong> fields are not visible directly underneath it, click on <strong class="bold">Additional Settings</strong> to expand it (refer to the bottom of the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window in <span><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em>). We can change the drawing order of sprites in two ways: 1) by specifying <strong class="bold">Sorting Layer</strong> or 2) by a value specified in the <strong class="bold">Order in </strong><span><strong class="bold">Layer</strong></span><span> field.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Sorting Layers is a topic we’ll be diving into in the coming chapters since we only need a single Layer for our current purpose – think of Layers as pages in a book where the order in which they are read front to back can be rearranged. Now, working with the <strong class="bold">Order in Layer</strong> field, we enter positive and negative integer values to set the sprites drawing order front to back on its <strong class="bold">Sorting Layer</strong> (currently Default). The default value is <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, putting every shape at the same depth. Since we want the black shape to be in the back of the red shape, set its <strong class="bold">Order in Layer</strong> value to <strong class="source-inline">-1</strong>. You can now readjust its size to give a nice outline thickness to the <span>red shape.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">You can select multiple shapes and change the <strong class="bold">Order in Layer</strong> value for all at once by holding the <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> or <em class="italic">Shift</em> key <span>when selecting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Creating the rest of the ladybug character is just a matter of duplicating a sprite shape already in the scene or creating a new one. The <strong class="bold">Sprite Creator</strong> shapes available are <strong class="bold">square</strong>, <strong class="bold">circle</strong>, <strong class="bold">capsule</strong>, <strong class="bold">diamond</strong>, <span>and </span><span><strong class="bold">hexagon</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Move the shapes into<a id="_idIndexMarker072" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> position by simply clicking and dragging on the sprite in the scene View and placing it in position. Hovering the mouse pointer near the corner point (blue dot) will show the rotation cursor. While this cursor is showing, clicking and dragging will <span>rotate it.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Additional reading | Unity documentation</p>
<p class="callout">You can read more about positioning GameObjects <span>at </span><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/PositioningGameObjects.xhtml" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"><span>https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/PositioningGameObjects.xhtml</span></a></p>
<p class="calibre3">Go ahead and create your own ladybug player character now. Use all of the <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> fields, <strong class="bold">Rect Tool</strong> with the modifier keys, and the <strong class="bold">Order in Layer</strong> field to draw. You will perform these actions repeatedly throughout creating the projects in the book for not only sprites but also UI elements. Have fun <span>with it!</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, you learned how to create a new <strong class="bold">Scene</strong>, add and duplicate sprites, and manipulate those<a id="_idIndexMarker073" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/> sprites to make our player character with the <strong class="bold">Order in Layer</strong> value. Next, before wrapping up this chapter, we’ll discuss <span>game design.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-37" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor037" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Game Design Document (GDD) – Introducing the 2D collection game</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Throughout <a id="_idIndexMarker074" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>the book, the game we’ll be creating will be defined and <a id="_idIndexMarker075" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>structured using what is known as <strong class="bold">Game Design Document</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDD</strong>). This document will serve as our point of reference as we decide how to develop the game’s core aspects. Our game is going to be pretty simple but packed with features. Most of the information written in the GDD is self-explanatory, but a few concepts might be new, so let’s start by <span>reviewing them:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre17">
<li class="calibre15">What is the name of <span>the game?</span><ul class="calibre22"><li class="calibre15">This one is self-explanatory, so just don’t stress over this now! Anything as a working title will work just fine – have fun <span>with it.</span></li></ul></li>
<li class="calibre15">What is the game’s <span><strong class="bold">core loop</strong></span><span>?</span><ul class="calibre22"><li class="calibre15">The core loop is what makes your game an enjoyable and satisfying experience for players. It is the series of actions the player repeatedly performs to accomplish <span>the objective.</span></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s see an example GDD filled out for the 2D collection game we’ll make throughout <span>the book:</span></p>

<p class="calibre3">As needed, we’ll be adding to the GDD over time, but this will serve us well as a starting <span>point. Yay!</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">This section <a id="_idIndexMarker076" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>introduced <a id="_idIndexMarker077" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>you to a simple GDD template and you learned the basic but essential questions to answer when making a <span>remarkable game.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-38" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor038" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre calibre6"/>Summary</h1>
<p class="calibre3">This chapter was a quick introduction to installing Unity Hub, installing the Unity Editor, and why we chose the 2D Universal RP template for creating our new 2D project. In this chapter, you learned the importance of <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong> for adding tooling and features to the Unity Editor specific to our project’s needs. You then learned how to make your way around the different windows and toolbars, and you used them to create and manipulate GameObjects in our new 2D scene. We also got a headstart on building the collection game by drawing our player character within the Unity Editor – learning the importance of Layer sorting order in <span>the process.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Finally, we started defining what the game we’re creating will be by deciding on a name for the game, writing our summary, and specifying some gameplay in the GDD – this will provide the necessary direction for the production of <span>the game.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next chapter, we’ll dive into creating the “Outer World” collection game environment, learning how to implement game mechanics through scripts, and adding a <span>basic UI.</span></p>
