Dynamics NAV allows you to create budgets for fixed assets, items, sales and purchases, and projects. But we will focus on general ledger budgets in this section.</p><p>With the general ledger budget feature, you can create multiple budgets for the same time periods, simple or complex budgets by selecting combinations of G/L accounts, periods, and dimensions. You can also copy budgets from previous periods or create your budgets outside the application, with Excel, and then import it into Dynamics NAV.</p><div class="section" title="Creating budgets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec59"/>Creating budgets</h2></div></div></div><p>Let's create a new budget for the first quarter of 2017.

Now, we will see when budgets can be used. Budgets are mainly to compare reality versus budgeted amounts to measure performance. Budget entries can be also used as a source for the cash flow management. We will cover those in the next section.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Trial Balance/Budget</strong></span> report, found under <span class="strong"><strong>Departments</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Financial Management</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>General Ledger</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Reports</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Financial Statement</strong></span>, compares the balance of each account in the charts of accounts with its budgeted amount for a given period.</p><p>You can also use budgets on <span class="strong"><strong>Account Schedules</strong></span> to measure performance in an aggregate way. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Column Layout</strong></span> definition, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Ledger Entry type</strong></span> field, you can select the <span class="strong"><strong>Budget Entries</strong></span> value to base the calculation on budget entries. To see an example, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Departments</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Financial Management</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>General</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Column Layouts</strong></span> and analyze the definition of the <span class="strong"><strong>ACT/BUD</strong></span> column layout.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Cash flow management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec43"/>Cash flow management</h1></div></div></div><p>Understanding the flow of incoming and outstanding cash is vital for any company. We need to know if we will have enough money to pay creditors and expenses when they are due. This is actually what the cash flow management functionality will tell us. We will see how to do this in this section.</p><p>The cash flow management functionalities analyze several sources of information to be able to predict cash needs. The sources that this functionality uses are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>General ledger</strong></span>: This uses information about the liquid funds and also about the budgets we have seen in the previous section</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Purchases</strong></span>: This uses information about the current payables and also forecasted information taken from open purchase orders</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sales</strong></span>: This uses information about the current receivables and also forecasted information taken from open sales orders</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Service</strong></span>: This uses information about open service orders</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Fixed assets</strong></span>: This uses information about planned disposal and budgeted purchases of fixed assets</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Manual revenues and expenses</strong></span>: This can also use information that we can set up manually, such as salaries, interest on credits, private consumptions, and so on</li></ul></div><p>Let's see how it works by creating a cash flow forecast:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Departments</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Financial Management</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cash Flow</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cash Flow Forecasts</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span> to create a new cash flow forecast.</li><li class="listitem">Press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> key.

</p></li><li class="listitem">Close the cash flow forecast card.</li></ol></div><p>We have created a forecast and we have set up the basic information about it. The next step is to obtain cash information from the system and bring it to our forecast. To do so, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Departments</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Financial Management</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cash Flow</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cash Flow Worksheet</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Suggest Worksheet Lines</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">In the <span class="strong"><strong>Cash Flow Forecast</strong></span> field, select the forecast you have just created.</li><li class="listitem">Specify the sources from which you want to take information out to do your cash flow prediction. For example, we have selected all of the available sources, as shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_05_08.jpg" alt="Cash flow management"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>. The system will look on all the specified sources and will create lines on the <span class="strong"><strong>Cash Flow Worksheet</strong></span>. On those lines, you will see: the <span class="strong"><strong>Source Type</strong></span>, the <span class="strong"><strong>Source No.</strong></span>, the <span class="strong"><strong>Cash Flow Date</strong></span>, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Amount</strong></span> in local currency.</li><li class="listitem">You can modify the suggested lines, delete them, or create new ones. This will allow you to adjust the suggestion in order to have a better forecast.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Register</strong></span>.</li></ol></div><p>At this point, we have created our cash flow forecast and we have brought to it, all the information about incoming and outgoing cash movements. Now, it's time to analyze all this information to be able to detect any liquidity problems.</p><p>Open the cash flow forecast card and click on <span class="strong"><strong>CF Availability by Periods</strong></span>. In this window, which is shown in the following screenshot, we can observe a liquidity problem in week 3. The liquidity problem will be solved in the fourth week. We can reschedule some of the purchase orders or negotiate a longer payment term with our vendors. Consider the following instance:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_05_09.jpg" alt="Cash flow management"/></div><p>
</p><p>By double-clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Purchase Orders</strong></span> value for week <span class="strong"><strong>3</strong></span>, we will see which purchase orders are due this week. Actually, there is only one purchase order, which is due on <code class="literal">13/01/2017</code>. We have talked to our vendor and have agreed to move the payment date to <code class="literal">21/01/2017</code>. After updating the payment information on the purchase order, we have suggested and registered new lines for the forecast on the cash flow worksheet. As we can see on the <span class="strong"><strong>CF Availability by Periods</strong></span> window now, the cash problem doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>

</p></li></ol></div><p>These are manual expenses such as <span class="strong"><strong>Personnel Costs</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Running Costs</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Finance Costs</strong></span> of <span class="strong"><strong>130000</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>75000</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>15000</strong></span> for every month from <span class="strong"><strong>01/01/2017</strong></span> to <span class="strong"><strong>12/31/2017</strong></span>.

You can define the chart of accounts you need. For those cash flow accounts that will get their information from the general ledger or from the budget, you will have to specify a G/L account filter and the type of G/L integration (balance, budget, or both):</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_05_12.jpg" alt="Cash flow management setup"/></div><p>

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec44"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we saw the tools that can help companies in the task of predicting and anticipating financial events. You learned to create new budgets using different sources of information. You can manually introduce budgeted amounts, copy it from real general ledger entries with an adjustment factor, or import it from Excel. You also learned how to predict cash needs by analyzing several sources of information, such as liquid funds, receivables and payables, outstanding orders, and budgets.</p><p>So far, we have come across sales and purchases, bank account management, and different accounting processes. In Dynamics NAV, everything leads to accounting, but most of the operations inside the financial management area can be done with little accountancy knowledge. In the next chapter, we will learn the setup options that allow this to happen.</p></div></body></html>
