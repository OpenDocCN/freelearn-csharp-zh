    of one of the methods of the base class in such a way that it no longer meets

    you have an `int Add(int a, int b)` method that returns the sum of two elements,
    and in the subclass you override this method to now return the difference of the
    elements multiplied by 2, it can lead to unexpected errors or bugs in the software
    code. This deviation can create unpredictability and complexity, making the system
    more prone to errors and harder to manage and maintain.

    of one large interface that encompasses all possible methods. In this way, classes

    static property or method to access the single instance. This pattern is often
    used in situations where there is a need to coordinate actions across different

    On the other hand, the Adapter pattern is utilized to ensure compatibility between
    two incompatible interfaces, transforming the interface of one class into another
    expected by the client. In C# projects, the Bridge pattern is more suitable when
    you need to build a flexible and scalable system with extendable abstractions

- en: When developing flexible and scalable test architectures, I focus on utilizing
    well-defined abstractions and design patterns. These allow for easy adaptation
    of tests to system changes. A key strategy is to develop tests that are independent,
    reusable, and easily scalable, which simplifies adaptation to future changes in
    the system.

- en: Certainly – utilizing containers such as Docker for simulating external services
    during integration testing can be highly beneficial. This approach enables the
    creation of isolated and controlled testing environments, where specific conditions
    for testing can be accurately reproduced. Containers also facilitate the automation
    of test scenarios and integration with CI/CD pipelines, making the testing process
    more streamlined and efficient.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Testing asynchronous code in C# demands a special approach. I typically use
    asynchronous test methods and frameworks that support asynchronous testing. One
    of the main challenges is managing side effects and states that can influence
    test results. This also includes correctly anticipating asynchronous operations
    and handling exceptions that might occur during asynchronous execution, ensuring
    the tests are robust and can handle real-world scenarios effectively.
