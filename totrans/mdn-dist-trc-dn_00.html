<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
<p>If you have worked on distributed applications, infrastructure, or client libraries, you’ve likely encountered numerous ways in which distributed systems can break.</p>
<p>For example, a default retry policy on your service can bring it down along with all its dependencies. Race conditions can lead to deadlocks under certain load or result in data leak between user accounts. User operations that usually take milliseconds can significantly slow down, while service dashboards show no signs of other issues. Functional problems can cause obscure and inexplicable effects on the user’s end.</p>
<p>When working with distributed applications, we rely on telemetry to assess their performance and functionality. We need even more telemetry to identify and mitigate issues.</p>
<p>In the past, we relied on custom logs and metrics collected using vendor-specific SDKs. We built custom parsers, processing pipelines, and reporting tools to make telemetry usable.</p>
<p>However, as applications have become more complex, we require better and more user-friendly approaches to understand what is happening in our systems. Personally, I find it unproductive to read through megabytes of logs or visually detect anomalies in metrics.</p>
<p>Distributed tracing is a technique that allows us to trace operations throughout the entire system. It provides correlation and causation to our telemetry, enabling us to retrieve all the relevant data describing a specific operation or find all operations based on the context, such as a requested resource or a user identifier.</p>
<p>Distributed tracing alone is not enough; we need other telemetry signals such as metrics, events, logs, and profiles, as well as libraries to collect and export them to observability backends. Fortunately, we have OpenTelemetry for this purpose. OpenTelemetry is a cloud-native, vendor-neutral telemetry platform available in multiple programming languages. It offers the core components necessary to collect custom data along with instrumentation libraries for common technologies. OpenTelemetry standardizes telemetry formats for different signals ensuring correlation, consistency, and structure in the collected data.</p>
<p>By leveraging consistent and structured telemetry, different observability vendors can provide tools such as service maps, trace visualizations, error classification, and detection of common properties contributing to failures. This essentially allows us to automate the error-prone and tedious parts of performance analysis that humans struggle with. Monitoring and debugging techniques can now become standardized practices across the industry, no longer relying on tribal knowledge, runbooks, or outdated documentation.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Modern Distributed Tracing in .NET</em> explores all aspects of telemetry collection in .NET applications, with a focus on distributed tracing and performance analysis. It begins with an overview of the observability challenges and solutions and then delves into the built-in monitoring capabilities offered by modern .NET applications. These capabilities become even more impressive when used alongside OpenTelemetry. While shared OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries can take us a long way, sometimes we still need to write custom instrumentations. The book shows how to collect custom traces, metrics, and logs while considering performance impact and verbosity. It also covers the instrumentation of common cloud patterns such as network calls, messaging, and database interactions. Finally, it discusses the organizational and technical aspects of implementing and evolving observability in existing systems.</p>
<p>The observability field is still relatively new and rapidly evolving, which means there are often multiple solutions available for almost any problem. This book aims to explain fundamental observability concepts and provides several possible solutions to common problems while highlighting the associated trade-offs. It also helps you gain practical skills to implement and leverage tracing and observability.</p>
<p>I hope you find the provided examples useful and use them as a playground for experimentation. I encourage you to explore new and creative approaches to making distributed systems more observable and to share your findings with the community!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for software developers, architects, and system operators running .NET services who want to use modern observability tools and standards. It offers a holistic approach to performance analysis and end-to-end debugging. Software testers and support engineers will also find this book useful. Basic knowledge of the C# programming language and the .NET platform is assumed for grasping the examples of manual instrumentation, but is not necessary.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B19423_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Observability Needs of Modern Applications</em>, provides an overview of common monitoring techniques and introduces distributed tracing.

<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>The examples in this book were developed with .NET 7.0. Most of them are cross-platform and run in Docker Linux containers or with the <code>dotnet</code> CLI tools. Examples were tested on Windows OS with OpenTelemetry version 1.4.0. They should work with future versions of .NET and OpenTelemetry libraries. We use pinned versions of OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Jaeger, and other external images in the <code>docker-compose</code> files.</p>
<p>In <a href="B19423_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">The .NET Observability Ecosystem</em>, we will experiment with AWS and Azure client libraries and serverless environments. AWS and/or Azure subscriptions are recommended, but not essential. We will stay within the free tier on AWS and within promotional credits amount available on Azure.</p>

<p>While OpenTelemetry guarantees API compatibility in future versions, the semantic conventions mentioned in this book are not stable. So spans, metrics, events, and attributes may be renamed or changed in a different way. Please refer to OpenTelemetry specification repo (<a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification">https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification</a>) to find what’s new in the semantic conventions area.</p>
