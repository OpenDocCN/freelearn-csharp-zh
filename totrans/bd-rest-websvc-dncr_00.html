<p>This book will take the readers through the design of RESTful web services and leverages the ASP.NET Core Framework to implement these services. Starting from the basics of the philosophy behind REST, the readers will go through the steps of designing and implementing an enterprise-grade RESTful web service. Taking a practical approach, each chapter provides code samples that they can apply to your own circumstances. It brings forth the power of the latest .NET Core release, working with MVC. It then goes beyond the use of the framework to explore approaches to tackle resilience, security, and scalability concerns. The readers will learn techniques to deal with security in Web APIs and discover how to implement unit and integration test strategies. Finally, the book ends by walking you through building a .NET client for your RESTful web service, along with some scaling techniques.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "The <kbd>Header</kbd> must appear as the first child of the envelope, before the body element."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version = "1.0"?&gt;<br/>&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope <br/> xmlns:SOAP-ENV = "http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope" <br/> SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle = "http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-encoding"&gt;<br/> ...<br/> SOAP Message information goes here<br/> ...<br/>&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>{<br/>  // GET: api/Products<br/>  <strong>[HttpGet]</strong><br/>  public IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt; Get()<br/>  {<br/>   <strong> return new Product[]</strong><br/>    {<br/>      new Product(1, "Oats", new decimal(3.07)),<br/>      new Product(2, "Toothpaste", new decimal(10.89)),<br/>      new Product(3, "Television", new decimal(500.90))<br/>    };<br/>  }<br/>}</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "<strong>Simple Object Access Protocol</strong> (<strong>SOAP</strong>) is an XML-based messaging protocol for exchanging information among computers."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
