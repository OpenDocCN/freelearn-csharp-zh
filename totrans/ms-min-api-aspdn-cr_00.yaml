- en: The simplification of code is every developer’s dream. Minimal APIs are a new
    feature in .NET 6 that aims to simplify code. They are used for building APIs
    with minimal dependencies in ASP.NET Core. Minimal APIs simplify API development
    through the use of more compact code syntax.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developers using minimal APIs will be able to take advantage of this syntax
    on some occasions to work more quickly with less code and fewer files to maintain.
    Here, you will be introduced to the main new features of .NET 6 and understand
    the basic themes of minimal APIs, which weren’t available in .NET 5 and previous
    versions. You’ll see how to enable Swagger for API documentation, along with CORS,
    and how to handle application errors. You will learn to structure your code better
    with Microsoft’s new .NET framework called Dependency Injection. Finally, you
    will see the performance and benchmarking improvements in .NET 6 that are introduced
    with minimal APIs.

    in what way they are related to the classic development of web APIs.

    introduces you to the motivations behind introducing minimal APIs within .NET
    6\. We will explain the main new features of .NET 6 and the work that the .NET
    team is doing with this latest version. You will come to understand the reasons

    Their Advantages*, introduces you to the basic ways in which minimal APIs differ
    from .NET 5 and all previous versions. We will explore in detail routing and serialization
    with System.Text.JSON. Finally, we will end with some concepts related to writing
    our first REST API.'
