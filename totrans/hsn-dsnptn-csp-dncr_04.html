<p><span>In this section, readers will get hands-on experience with various design patterns. Specific patterns will be illustrated in the process of building a sample application for maintaining an inventory application. An inventory application was chosen as it is conceptually simple but will provide enough complexity to benefit from the use of patterns during development. Certain patterns and principles will be revisited more than once, such as SOLID, <strong>Minimal Viable Product</strong> (<strong>MVP</strong>), and <strong>Test-driven development</strong> (<strong>TDD</strong>). By the end of this section, readers will be able to write neat and clean code with the help of various patterns. </span></p>
