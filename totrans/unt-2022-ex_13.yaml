    for environment design using Unity’s in-Editor 3D toolset, and how to convert
    2D systems to 3D systems while covering the Physics API methods in C# code. You
    will also learn about creating a 3D FPS player character using Unity’s Starter
    Asset and player mechanics by adding reusable components from previous lessons.
    You will learn about introducing tactics using which players can fend off infected
    robots in a fully fleshed-out 3D environment with beautiful lighting and optimized
