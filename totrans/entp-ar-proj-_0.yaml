- en: '**Augmented reality** (**AR**) is an amazing technology that dates back to
    the 1990s and was mostly unknown to the general public until the appearance of
    Google Glass and the release of the AR-based game Pokemon Go. Although, initially,
    it was mainly used in marketing to get the *wow effect*, it has since proved to
    be a natural interface for the user in many other fields, such as tourism, industry,
    medicine, and education. Its versatility of features (based on image or physical
    world recognition, GPS location, and more) and target devices (Android/iOS mobile
    devices, computer, web, and **Head Mounted Displays** (**HMD**)) makes it the
    perfect complement for different sectors and implementations such as industrial
    guides, live art experiences, and training tools.'

    and building applications with AR using the best-known frameworks on the market.
    In this book, we''ll explore the aspects of developing AR-based applications for
    six different enterprise sectors (manufacturing, training, marketing, retail,
    automation, and tourism) in detail, starting from the market needs and choosing
    the most suitable tool in each case. Each chapter will cover a new use of AR by
    using a different framework or target device.'

- en: The first chapter will be an introduction to AR so that you will have a good
    understanding of its uses and potential before starting to code. Next, we'll introduce
    you to Unity, an amazing 3D tool that will simplify the task of integrating AR
    frameworks and manipulating 3D objects and scenes in many of the chapters. Then,
    we'll work with Android Studio and ARCore to create our first augmented project
    for prototyping. Afterward, we will explore both WebAR with the Google Web Component
    `<model-viewer>`, and the emerging AR authoring tool, Augmented Class!, for education.
    Next, we will start working with Unity to integrate the AR framework, EasyAR,
    to create an AR catalog for a marketing experience. We will then continue with
    the Vuforia framework and use it retail. Furthermore, we will use Vuforia combined
    with AR glasses to create a step-by-step guide for an automation process. We will
    then end the book with ARKit, developed, in this case, inside Xcode, to implement
    an augmented dimensional portal for tourism.

    uses. It covers the origins of the technology, types of AR that can be developed,
    the frameworks you will be using through the book, and the main uses of AR in
    different enterprise sectors.'

    for training purposes. With WebAR, you will learn how to develop a simple web
    app that includes the `<model-viewer>` web component, which will be used to launch
    AR from an ARCore-supporting mobile device. Augmented Class! is an authoring tool
    for Android that''s used to easily create interactive educational AR projects.'

    would be helpful as we will be using Java, C#, and Swift for our projects. However,
