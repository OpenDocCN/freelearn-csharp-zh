    software product in a short period, which means the efficiency and the speed of
    the development team are game changers. To achieve this goal, companies must apply
    a set of well-defined activities and structured stages that define the **software
    development life cycle**, also known as the **SDLC**.

    of software development and make it more efficient, ensuring the final product
    is delivered on time within the project budget and is totally in line with the
    expectations of the client.

    model**, the **Spiral model**, and the **Agile model**. They are popular and widely
    used by most software development organizations. Selecting the right model depends
    mainly on the size of the project and other factors. In the following sections,
    we are going to explore these models in detail to help you decide which model

- en: In the first meeting with the client, try to identify the different stakeholders
    and discuss the scope of work to make it clear for all parties. After that, you
    will have to meet with all the stakeholders to collect the detailed requirements.
    During these workshops, make sure you keep all your discussions within the scope
    set forth. This is important to keep the requirements aligned with the business
    needs and to avoid adding functionalities that the product was never expected

- en: The next step after completing the requirements analysis workshop is to document
    all the information that was gathered in the previous step to define the product
    requirements. Usually, the output result of this activity is the **Software Requirement
    Specification** (**SRS**) document, which consists of all the detailed requirements
    to be designed and developed during all the phases of the project, from the beginning
    to its end, until the desired product is delivered. This SRS becomes the *requirements

- en: Once the SRS document has been finalized and reviewed by all the parties involved
    in this project, make sure you send it back to the key stakeholders, or the representatives
    of the key stakeholders, to sign it. The purpose of signing the SRS is to agree
    that the requirements that are presented and defined in the document are clear
    and reflect the business needs, as discussed in the analysis workshop. This formal
    commitment, which is expressed by all parties involved, will play a crucial role
    in the project life cycle to ensure that the project will not struggle from **scope

- en: In project management, scope creep (or requirement creep) refers to a situation
    where the client is continuously requesting changes and adding new features to
    the product, even after project kickoff. As a result, the project's scope will
    continue to grow, which will affect the delivery time and the final cost of the
    product. This should not occur and to prevent it, you must make sure that all
    the business needs (that is, the scope of the project) are very detailed and properly
    defined, and that the client has officially committed to the scope of work.

    client to verify that every single functionality provided by the software works,
    and to confirm that all the requirements have been covered. This will ensure that
    the software behaves exactly as the users expect and that they can easily use
    it without any errors or crashes occurring. At the end of the UAT, the client
    should accept the software or request some improvements before moving the software
    to the production environment.

  zh: 用户验收测试是最后的测试环节。由客户执行，以验证软件提供的每个功能是否正常工作，并确认所有要求都已涵盖。这将确保软件的行为与用户期望的完全一致，并且他们可以轻松使用而不会出现任何错误或崩溃。在UAT结束时，客户应接受软件或在将软件转移到生产环境之前要求一些改进。

    Each iteration lasts for about 2-4 weeks (usually, it shouldn't be a long time).

    of the software. The idea is to take the use cases and split them into iterations

    In this way, the development team is producing ongoing and incremental releases

- en: When selecting the right SDLC model to build a particular product, it's important
    to remember that each model offers a unique process that may help you overcome
    the challenges that you will encounter during the development cycle. One model
    would never fit every project or every client's needs, which is why you should
    understand these popular models and know when to apply them.

- en: Finding the right model depends heavily on the factors the project will be executed
    with, such as your current infrastructure, the culture adopted by your team, and
    how the client would like the project to be managed. Certain projects may run
    best with a Waterfall approach, while others would benefit from the flexibility
    of the Agile model.
