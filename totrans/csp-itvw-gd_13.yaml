    how their code really works. With a solid understanding of essentials, you can
    write good, reliable code. They should start from learning about things like data
    types in CLR, what is stack and heap, OOP principles, SOLID principles, how different
    constructions like using statement and foreach works and asynchronous state machines.
    Also, for me, looking how C# works under the hood when it is compiled to IL was
    very interesting and it helped me better understand how my code works. When you
    know essentials, you can start learning about ASP.NET, MAUI, and other frameworks
    that you want to learn.

    My biggest mistake was that I grabbed every job opportunity regardless of the
    technology stack. Therefore, I advise you to choose a target area for development,
    and without being distracted by other sweet jobs, improve your highly specialized
    profile and go for interviews on it. It may seem like it will take a long time,
    but if you scatter your attention on the entire spectrum of C# opportunities,
    it will take even more time, and as a result, you will be left with nothing.
