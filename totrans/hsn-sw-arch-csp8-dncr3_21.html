<p class="mce-root">This last section of the book will guide you on how to deliver software using DevOps principles for <strong>Continuous Integration</strong> (<strong>CI</strong>) and <strong>Continuous Deployment</strong> (<strong>CD</strong>). The greatest players in the software services world have transformed the concept of software delivery in the last few years. Therefore, this section will discuss the new and revolutionary ways of thinking that have emerged.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In <a href="b444cf5c-311d-4f74-80b0-0e86c0c13307.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>, <em>Deploying Your Application with Azure DevOps</em>, we will discuss the new philosophy of software delivery and how Azure DevOps can help you embrace this new approach, and master build and deploy pipelines principles.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In <a href="94c84805-6921-4b9b-9f11-745dce643f53.xhtml">Chapter 18</a>, <em>Understanding DevOps Principles</em>, we will cover the main concepts of DevOps, the process that everybody is learning about and putting into practice these days. Besides that, the chapter will present tools for developing and delivering your software with DevOps.</p>
<p>Then, in <a href="db7586ff-b06d-4503-a64a-9a6678d09acb.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, <em>Challenges of Applying CI Scenarios in DevOps</em>, the focus will be directed toward the challenges related to continuously integrating and deploying a solution. The idea is to make sure you understand the risks and follow best practices when using CI.</p>
<p> <a href="e61b3c5d-3abd-4442-9c9c-e12fd3acedcc.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>, <em>Automation for Software Testing</em>, is focused on software testing automation. Since testing is an unavoidable (and repetitive) process, its automation is extremely important. This chapter will teach you how to write automated functional test cases for a project.</p>
