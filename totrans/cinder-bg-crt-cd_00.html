It is based on one of the most popular and powerful intermediate-level programming language C++ and relies on minimum third-party libraries. It is a combination of low-level and high-level language features, and that makes it relatively easy to grasp for those who have a higher-level programming language background.</p><p>Cinder can be considered the next-level creative coding framework for those who are familiar with Processing, ActionScript, or other similar high-level programming languages or frameworks. Cinder may seem similar to openFrameworks, it is, in terms since it is based on C++, but the philosophy behind the framework is a bit different. </p><p>openFrameworks is based on a lot of third-party libraries that do the job and sometimes may make a simple application to be big in size. Cinder is different in terms, that is, it tries to make use of the features of the operating system that it runs on. It does not mean that it is better than openFrameworks, but for some scenarios it may be more efficient than the other one.</p><p>Programming is something that rapidly becomes a skill that everyone should know. Estonia just introduced computer programming learning for all children attending school, meaning that everyone from Grades 1 to 12 are learning how to code. It is not hard to believe that there will be a lot of other countries that will follow. This means that in the future computer technology will be everywhere more than it is today and the situation will demand a vast amount of people who will need to take care of it. Another fact is that we most probably will see programming in more and more fields that previously had weak or absolutely no connection to it.</p><p>And that is where creative coding comes in. Creative coding is becoming more and more popular these days as even more people start to appreciate the logical and interactive dimension that programming can give to their work. It is possible to create a painting that paints itself, a live sculpture, or an interactive chair that does not let anyone to sit on it—the possibilities are endless. It is only the matter of ones creativity and programming knowledge.</p><p>One thing that is important in todays creative coding frameworks is performance and flexibility. Usually the more powerful and flexible a framework is, the harder it is to learn it. As Cinder is both, flexible, and powerful, it is not an easy task to understand how to use it.</p><p>This book is a trial to make the Cinder learning curve less steep. Through a collection of simple guided examples, we will try to cover the basic functionality that is usually provided by other creative coding tools.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Accelerate – Creating Generative Animation">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Accelerate – Creating Generative Animation</em>, teaches the basics of generative or procedural animation with Cinder. Throughout the chapter we will create an infinite looped animation application.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Working with Images – Real-time Postprocessing and Effects">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Working with Images – Real-time Postprocessing and Effects</em>, explains the several features that Cinder provides to let you manipulate images, and moving image frames down to the pixel level without loosing speed. In this chapter we will learn how to use Cinder for applying and creating basic effects for still images and real-time use.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Adding Depth – Cinder 3D Basics">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Adding Depth – Cinder 3D Basics</em>, introduces you to the basic 3D aspects and practical methods, as well as the 3D primitives that can be drawn with Cinder.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Enter Sound – Adding Sound and Audio">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Enter Sound – Adding Sound and Audio</em>, explains how to load, modify, play back, and use sound files, as well as live audio input to draw and animate.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Talk to the User – Adding Interactivity and UI Events">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Talk to the User – Adding Interactivity and UI Events</em>, explains how to handle mouse, keyboard, and other events in Cinder.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Basic Cinder Functionality Reference">Appendix A</a>, <em>Basic Cinder Functionality Reference</em>, helps you find some basic Cinder functionality used in this book for later reference.</p><p>
<em>Bonus Chapter</em>, <em>Escaping Singleness – Communicating with Other Applications</em>, is not present in the book but is available for download at the following link: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/Escaping_Singleness.pdf">http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/Escaping_Singleness.pdf</a>

The code samples in this book are tested on Mac OS X 10.6+ and Windows 7 machines. There is a list of development software for each operating system and further details about it will be discussed in the following chapters. In this book we will make use of the following software:</p><p>
<strong>Mac OS X</strong>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for those who want to make a change either from a lower-level creative coding framework or from other kinds of coding to creative coding with Cinder. You will not find an introductory chapter about programming in general in this book, you should know something about it already.</p><p>This book is for you if you have previous experience with text-based programming languages such as Processing, ActionScript, JavaScript, or visual ones, such as Pure Data, Max MSP, VVVV, or Quartz Composer.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the <code class="literal">include</code> directive."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">void TextBoxApp::render()
{
  string txt = "Here is some text that is larger than can fit 
  naturally inside of 100 pixels.\nAnd here is another line after 
  a hard break."; [default]</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">void TextBoxApp::render()
{
<strong>  string txt = "Here is some text that is larger than can fit </strong>
  naturally inside of 100 pixels.\nAnd here is another line after 
  a hard break."; [default]</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "clicking the <strong>Next</strong> button moves you to the next screen".</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
