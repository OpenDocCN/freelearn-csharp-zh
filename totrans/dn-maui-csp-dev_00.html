		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>.NET MAUI is Microsoft’s cross-platform development framework for building iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Tizen apps. With .NET MAUI, you build the UI and the logic once and emit native code for each platform. It is the successor technology to <strong class="bold">Xamarin.Forms</strong> and adds powerful new features and capabilities.</p>
			<p>The .NET MAUI Community Toolkit supplements .NET MAUI to provide source code generators, behaviors, and much more, greatly enhancing and extending .NET MAUI as the premier development framework for building applications.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is targeted at anyone who has a fundamental understanding of C# and wishes to write cross-platform applications. If you are not a C# programmer but have experience with another object-oriented program, you should have no trouble following the examples.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B19723_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Assembling Your Tools and Creating Your First App</em>, shows you how to download the (free) software you need and will teach you how to create an “out-of-the-box” app to see what is provided to get you started.</p>
			<p><a href="B19723_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor027"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">What We Will Build – Forget Me Not</em>, introduces our non-trivial, real-world app – “Forget Me Not.” We’ll go over what it does and then we’ll walk through the various pages to see the entire completed project that we’ll be working on for the rest of the book.</p>
			<p><a href="B19723_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor036"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">XAML and Fluent C#</em>, explores the markup language used to create the UI of a .NET MAUI app. We’ll also examine how you can write the UI in C# if you prefer.</p>
			<p><a href="B19723_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">MVVM and Controls</em>, examines the most popular and powerful architecture for building .NET MAUI apps – <strong class="bold">Model-View-ViewModel</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVVM</strong>). We’ll also take a look at many of the core controls used to create the UI.</p>
			<p><a href="B19723_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Advanced Controls</em>, builds on the previous chapter, adding more advanced controls to create a more powerful and robust UI.</p>
			<p><a href="B19723_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Layout</em>, focuses on the techniques to arrange the controls on your view and create a professional appearance.</p>
			<p><a href="B19723_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor129"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding Navigation</em>, shows how you move from one page to another and how you can pass along data as you navigate. No serious .NET MAUI app has only one page.</p>
			<p><a href="B19723_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor144"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Storing and Retrieving Data</em>, explores the two ways to persist data. The first is useful for storing a user’s preferences for the program. The second involves building a relational database using SQLite.</p>
			<p><a href="B19723_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Unit Testing</em>, shows how to use xUnit and the mocking tool <strong class="bold">nSubstitute</strong> to create powerful unit tests. No .NET MAUI program is complete without an extensive suite of unit tests to ensure a program is working correctly.</p>
			<p><a href="B19723_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Consuming REST Services</em>, explores how to validate a user’s login and obtain their data from Azure. Many modern apps get their data from the cloud, and the most popular way to do so is by using REST services.</p>
			<p><a href="B19723_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring Advanced Topics</em>, moves into expert techniques, such as managing visual states, using behaviors and triggers, and selecting data templates at run time.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>You will want to have at least fundamental experience with an object-oriented language, especially C#. You do not need to know the latest advances in C#, and the example code is explained in depth. You will want the latest version of Visual Studio; the Community Edition is free and will work fine. If you are on a Mac (or Linux), the examples should work fine with Visual Studio for Mac, although they were not developed on a Mac.</p>

			<p>In this part, we will get you set up with the required software and examine the project we’re going to build. We’ll then go on to examine XAML – the markup language for .NET MAUI. Next, we’ll take a deep look at MVVM, the architecture for it and most .NET MAUI apps, and we’ll undertake an extensive review of the controls and structures used to build the user interface.</p>
