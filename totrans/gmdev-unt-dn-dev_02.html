		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Chapter 1</em>: Hello Unity</h1>
			<p>Before we get started with using Unity to develop games, I think it's good to first understand Unity itself. Many people, especially those who are interested in games and game development, know that Unity is a widely used game engine, and you may have played many games developed with Unity. But you may not be familiar with how to use Unity to develop games. For example, there are many different Unity versions available, so how do you choose the version that suits you? Unity provides different subscription plans, but which subscription plan is right for your situation? </p>
			<p>If you have never used Unity before, it is necessary for you to learn how to use the Unity Editor first. In addition to the Unity Editor, what features does the Unity engine provide to help game developers develop games? It is also important to know the features in Unity. If you are a .NET developer, then it's likely that you are familiar with Visual Studio. You need to know how to use Visual Studio to develop a Unity game. But developing a Unity game is different from developing a .NET application. </p>
			<p>Am I asking too many questions? Don't worry – this chapter will help you answer them. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will introduce how to choose the right release of Unity and provide an overview of how to download and install Unity via the Unity Hub or the Unity installer. Then, we will choose the right subscription plan for your situation. At this point, you should have installed Unity and opened the Unity Editor. </p>
			<p>If you have only just started using the Unity Editor, you may not know how to use it. We will first explore the Unity Editor and then discuss the different features provided by Unity. We will then introduce the .NET profiles in Unity and the scripting backend offered by Unity. Finally, we will present how to use Visual Studio to develop Unity games.</p>
			<p>We will cover the following key topics in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Getting started with the Unity Editor</li>
				<li>Working with different features in Unity</li>
				<li>.NET/C# and scripting in Unity</li>
				<li>Building Unity games with Visual Studio</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>Before starting, I highly recommend you first check whether your system can run the Unity Editor. The following table gives the minimum requirements to run the Unity Editor:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B17146_01_Table_1.1.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Getting started with the Unity Editor </h1>
			<p>Whether you are an independent game developer or work in a team for a company, you need to do two things before installing or even downloading Unity:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Choose the right Unity release for you. </li>
				<li>Choose the right subscription plan for you.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Therefore, before<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> introducing how to install Unity and exploring the Unity Editor, let's first introduce the Unity release and subscription plans. We hope that by reading these contents, you can find the right release for you and choose a suitable subscription plan.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Choosing the right Unity release for you</h2>
			<p>Nowadays, Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>offers two different release versions each year. They are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tech Stream releases</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Long-Term Support</strong> (<strong class="bold">LTS</strong>) releases:</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.01_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 – Unity releases&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.1 – Unity releases</p>
			<p>You may not be quite sure which version of Unity is best to use in your project, so I will explain these two different releases so that you can get an idea of how to choose the right release for you.</p>
			<p>LTS releases<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> provide developers with maximum stability and full support for their projects, and they are the last Tech Stream releases of each year. With LTS releases, there are no new features or API changes. The updates of LTS releases address crashes, and fix bugs and any minor issues. As I mentioned at the beginning of this section, each year, Unity releases new versions of the LTS release, and each one is supported for 2 full years from the date of the announcement.</p>
			<p>Therefore, if you are<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> looking for performance and stability, or your project is already in production or in the middle of development, it is a good idea to use the latest LTS release version to ensure best performance and stability.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">At the time of writing (April 2022), there are two LTS releases, namely Unity 2020 LTS and Unity 2019.4. Unity 2020 LTS is the latest LTS release and has the same feature set as the Unity 2020.2 Tech Stream release. Alternatively, Unity 2019.4 is the legacy LTS release now.</p>
			<p>The Tech Stream releases<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> give developers who want to explore the latest <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>in-progress features an option to use them to prepare for future projects. Unlike the LTS releases, a Tech Stream release will be released twice a year (typically published in the first and last quarters) and will only be supported until the next Tech Stream release is officially published. </p>
			<p>Therefore, if you are preparing for your next project or working on prototyping and experimentation, you should try the Tech Stream releases.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">At the time of writing (April 2022), the latest Tech Stream release is Unity 2021.2. </p>
			<p>By reading this section, I hope you have gained an understanding of the Unity releases, and you should be able to choose the right Unity release according to your situation. </p>
			<p>When writing this book, I chose the latest LTS version, Unity 2020.3.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Choosing the right subscription plan for you</h2>
			<p>Unity is a widely used game <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>engine, and many independent game <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>developers use Unity to develop their games. But technically speaking, Unity is not a free game engine. In this section, I will introduce several different subscription plans offered by Unity. I hope that after reading this section, you can choose a subscription plan that suits your situation.</p>
			<p>Unity offers a<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> range of plans, from the free Personal plan for individual learners to <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>Enterprise plans used by large organizations:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.02_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2 – The Plans and pricing page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.2 – The Plans and pricing page</p>
			<p>Because each Unity<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> plan has different eligibility requirements, you should choose the right plan for your project. Next, I will introduce the subscription plans:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Personal plan</strong> is free<a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> and includes all the basic functionality of Unity. You can choose this plan if you work as an individual and have earned less than $100,000 in revenue or funding for your Unity project in the past 12 months. In addition, if you are a student or educator, you can get additional benefits, but before that, you need to join<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> the <strong class="bold">GitHub Student Developer Pack</strong> to be verified.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Plus plan</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> paid plan and offers more functionality and training resources, such as advanced cloud diagnostics and splash screen customization. If you have earned more than $100,000 but less than $200,000 in revenue from using Unity in the past 12 months, you should choose this plan.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Pro plan</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>also a paid plan. Compared with the Plus plan, you can get more technical support from Unity by using the Pro plan. If your organization has earned more than $200,000 in the last 12 months from any source, you must use the Pro plan or the <strong class="bold">Enterprise plan</strong>. </li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Enterprise plan</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>specifically for teams with at least 20 members and provides more support than the Pro plan. For example, a customer success manager from Unity will be assigned to your organization to provide guidance, orchestrate resources, and<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> serve as an internal advocate.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I hope this section was helpful for you in choosing the right Unity plan for your situation. Next, let's download and install the Unity Editor!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Downloading and installing the Unity Editor</h2>
			<p>There are two different ways to download and install the Unity Editor. The first and recommended way to download and install Unity is to use the <strong class="bold">Unity Hub</strong>. </p>
			<p>The Unity Hub<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> is a management tool that can be used to manage all your Unity projects and Unity installations. We can take the following steps to install the Unity Hub and the Unity Editor:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To install the <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>Unity Hub, visit <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>the <strong class="bold">Download Unity</strong> page at <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download</a>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.03_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3 – The Download Unity page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.3 – The Download Unity page</p>
			<p>As you can see in the <strong class="bold">System requirements</strong> section in the preceding screenshot, the<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> Unity Hub supports <strong class="bold">Windows</strong>, <strong class="bold">Mac OS X</strong>, <strong class="bold">Ubuntu</strong>, and <strong class="bold">CentOS</strong>. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Installing the Unity Hub is very easy; you just need to choose the folder where the Unity Hub is installed. Then, click on the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button: </li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.04_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.4 – Unity Hub Setup&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.4 – Unity Hub Setup</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">After installing the <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>Unity Hub, select the <strong class="bold">Run Unity Hub</strong> option and click on the <strong class="bold">Finish</strong> button to launch the Unity Hub:</li>
			</ol>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.5 – Completing Unity Hub Setup</p>
			<p>I am using the latest version of Unity Hub (<em class="italic">version 3.0.0</em>) at the time of writing. If you have used previous versions of Unity Hub, you will find that the launch page of the new version of Unity Hub is completely different. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">You need a<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> Unity account to access the Unity Editor and the Unity Hub. If you don't have a Unity account yet, then you need to create a new one:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.06_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.6 – Unity Hub&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.6 – Unity Hub</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">When you sign into the Unity Hub<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> for the first time, you will be asked to add an active license, as you can see at the top of the following screenshot. Click on<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> the <strong class="bold">Manage licenses</strong> button to open the <strong class="bold">Licenses</strong> setting panel:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.07_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.7 – Click the Manage licenses button&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.7 – Click the Manage licenses button</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">There are two buttons available for you to add a new license. You can click either the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button at the <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>top-right corner or the <strong class="bold">Add license</strong> button:</li>

			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.08_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.8 – The Licenses setting panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.8 – The Licenses setting panel</p>
			<p>Then, you have <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>different options to activate the license. We have discussed the different Unity subscription plans in the previous section:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.09_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.9 – Add new license&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.9 – Add new license</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">After adding the <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>new license, we can start exploring the Unity Hub. From the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> view, you can find a list of Unity projects that are tracked by the Unity Hub. You can also create a brand-new project by clicking the <strong class="bold">New project</strong> button at the upper-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> view, or you can <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>import an existing project by clicking the <strong class="bold">Open</strong> button:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.10_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.10 – The Projects view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.10 – The Projects view</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">To install the Unity Editor, open the <strong class="bold">Installs</strong> view, where you can manage the installation of multiple versions of <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>the Unity Editor:</li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.11 – The Installs view</p>
			<p>There is a list of the<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> Unity Editors that are installed and managed by the Unity Hub. Similar to the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> view, you can download and install a new Unity Editor, or you can import an existing Unity Editor that is not managed by the Unity Hub, such as the Unity Editor that we installed using the Unity installer.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="9">Open the <strong class="bold">Install Unity Editor</strong> panel by clicking the <strong class="bold">Install Editor</strong> button on the <strong class="bold">Installs</strong> view. Then, you will see the latest version of each release:</li>
			</ol>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.12 – Install Unity Editor</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Unity 2018 LTS has reached the end of its support cycle, so you should not install it.</p>
			<p>We will use the <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>latest version of the Unity 2020 LTS release, so we need to install Unity <strong class="bold">2020.3.13f1</strong> here: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.13_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.13 – Install Unity 2020.3.13f1&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.13 – Install Unity 2020.3.13f1</p>
			<p>Then, we need to<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> select the modules that need to be installed. As you can see in the preceding screenshot, <strong class="bold">Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019</strong> will be installed by default, which will be our <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) to develop games in Unity.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you want to change the installation location, you can change it in the <strong class="bold">Installs</strong> settings of the <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong> panel.</p>
			<p>Once it has been downloaded and installed, we are ready to start exploring the Unity Editor! </p>
			<p>Sometimes, you may need a<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> specific version that is not available through the Unity Hub, such as some older Unity versions. At this point, you can also install the Unity Editor a second way, which is through the <strong class="bold">Unity installer</strong>. You can use the Unity installer to download the previous versions of Unity:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.14_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.14 – The Unity download archive page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.14 – The Unity download archive page</p>
			<p>Now, follow these steps to install the Unity Editor<a id="_idIndexMarker034"/> through the Unity installer:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">To download a previous version of Unity, you should access the Unity download archive page at <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive">https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive</a>. </li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button and choose the components of Unity that you want to download and install. The Unity installer should resemble the following screenshot:</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="3">The Unity Editor is<a id="_idIndexMarker035"/> selected by default; in order to build games for different platforms, you also need to select the corresponding <strong class="bold">build support</strong> components. For example, if you want to build an Android game running on Android devices, you need to download and install the <strong class="bold">Android Build Support</strong> component:</li>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.18 – Downloading and Installing</p>
			<p>After the download and installation are complete, the Unity Editor icon will appear on your desktop.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Exploring the Unity Editor</h2>
			<p>The first thing we <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>need to do is use the Unity Hub to create a new Unity project. As I mentioned in the previous section, we will create a brand-new project by clicking the <strong class="bold">New Project</strong> button at the upper-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> view.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.19_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.19 – Creating a new project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.19 – Creating a new project</p>
			<p>As shown in the <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>preceding screenshot, we can choose different Unity Editor versions for this new project, and Unity provides us with some built-in project templates, such as the <strong class="bold">2D</strong>, <strong class="bold">3D</strong>, <strong class="bold">HDRP</strong>, and <strong class="bold">URP</strong> templates. You can also download and install more templates from Unity, such as the <strong class="bold">VR</strong> template and the <strong class="bold">AR</strong> template. In the <strong class="bold">PROJECT SETTINGS</strong> section, you can set the name of the project and the location of the project.</p>
			<p>Here, we will choose the default <code>UnityBook</code>. Then, click on the <strong class="bold">Create project</strong> button. After that, the Unity Editor you previously selected will launch and open a new project for you:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.20_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.20 – The Unity Editor&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.20 – The Unity Editor</p>
			<p>As you can see in the <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>preceding screenshot, the Unity Editor layout organizes the most important windows for you. Specifically, the default layout divides the editor interface into five key areas. From top to bottom, they are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Toolbar</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hierarchy window</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scene view and Game view</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inspector window</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project window </strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Next, I will introduce these UI areas in order.</p>
			<h3>The Toolbar</h3>
			<p>The Toolbar<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> is always at the top of the Unity Editor interface, and it consists of several <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>groups of controls: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.21_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.21 – The Toolbar&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.21 – The Toolbar</p>
			<p>From left to right, the<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> first tool in the Toolbar is the <strong class="bold">transform tools set</strong>. The transform tools<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> are used in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view and allow you to pan around the Scene and <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>move, rotate, and scale individual GameObjects in the Scene:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.22_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.22  – The transform tools set&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.22  – The transform tools set</p>
			<p>The next tool is the <strong class="bold">Gizmo handle position toggles set</strong>, which is<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> used to define the position of any transform tool Gizmo in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.23_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.23 – The Gizmo handle position toggles set&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.23 – The Gizmo handle position toggles set</p>
			<p>Then, you can find the <strong class="bold">Play, Pause, and Step buttons</strong> in the center. You can use these buttons in the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.24_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.24 – The Play, Pause, and Step buttons&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.24 – The Play, Pause, and Step buttons</p>
			<p>On the right side, let's take a look <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>at the <strong class="bold">Unity Plastic SCM</strong> button first, which allows you to access the Plastic SCM version control and source code management tool in the Unity Editor directly. You can click the <strong class="bold">cloud</strong> button to open the <strong class="bold">Unity Services</strong> window, where you are able to access a lot of cloud services provided by Unity, such as the <strong class="bold">Cloud Build</strong> service, the <strong class="bold">Analytics</strong> service, and the <strong class="bold">Ads</strong> service.</p>
			<p>You can also access your Unity account from the <strong class="bold">Account</strong> drop-down menu. There are two other drop-down menus on the right, namely <strong class="bold">Layers</strong> and <strong class="bold">Layout</strong>; you can control which objects in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view appear using the <strong class="bold">Layers</strong> drop-down menu and change or create a new layout of your Unity Editor using the <strong class="bold">Layout</strong> drop-down menu:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.25_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.25 – The Unity Collaborate and Unity Services buttons and &#13;&#10;the Unity Account, Layers, and Layout dropdowns&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.25 – The Unity Collaborate and Unity Services buttons and the Unity Account, Layers, and Layout dropdowns</p>
			<h3>The Hierarchy window</h3>
			<p>The second <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>area is the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window. As <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>you can see in the following screenshot, the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window in the Unity Editor displays everything in a <strong class="bold">Scene</strong>; the <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>things in the Scene, such as <strong class="bold">Main Camera</strong>, <strong class="bold">Directional Light</strong>, and the 3D cube, are<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> called <strong class="bold">GameObjects</strong>. </p>
			<p>We can also organize all the objects in the game world in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.26_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.26 – The Hierarchy window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.26 – The Hierarchy window</p>
			<p>It is very easy to create a new GameObject in a Scene. You only need to right-click on the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window, and a menu will pop up where you can select the object you want to create:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.27_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.27 – Creating a new GameObject&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.27 – Creating a new GameObject</p>
			<p>It is worth noting that<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> Unity uses parent-child hierarchies to organize <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>GameObjects, so you can create one object as a child of another. If you want to create a new GameObject as a child of another GameObject, then you only need to select the parent GameObject first and then right-click to create the child GameObject:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.28_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.28 – The parent-child hierarchy&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.28 – The parent-child hierarchy</p>
			<p>Another way to create a parent-child hierarchy is to directly drag an existing GameObject onto the parent GameObject in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.29_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.29 – The parent-child hierarchy&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.29 – The parent-child hierarchy</p>
			<p>As you can see in <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>the preceding screenshot, we dragged the GameObject <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>named <strong class="bold">Cube</strong> onto the GameObject named <strong class="bold">Child</strong> to create a parent-child hierarchy.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.30_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.30 – Hiding and showing GameObjects&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.30 – Hiding and showing GameObjects</p>
			<p>Another feature of the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window is that it allows you to hide and show GameObjects in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view without changing their visibility in the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view or the final application.</p>
			<h3>The Scene view and the Game view</h3>
			<p>The center of the default Unity Editor layout is<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view and<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view, which <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>is the most important window in the Unity Editor. The <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/><strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view is an interactive view of the game world you are creating:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.31_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.31 – The Scene view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.31 – The Scene view</p>
			<p>You can use the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view to manipulate GameObjects and view them from various angles. Also, there are some useful tools available in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view, such as the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> Gizmo tool at the upper-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.32_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.32 – The Scene Gizmo tool&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.32 – The Scene Gizmo tool</p>
			<p>It shows the current orientation of the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view camera and allows you to quickly modify the angle of the view and projection mode.</p>
			<p>If you want to modify the settings of<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view camera, you can click the <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> button <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>next to the <strong class="bold">Gizmos</strong> button to open <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>the <strong class="bold">Scene Camera</strong> settings window:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.33_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.33 – The Scene Camera settings&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.33 – The Scene Camera settings</p>
			<p>Here, you can adjust some settings of the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view camera, such as <strong class="bold">Field of View</strong> and <strong class="bold">Camera Speed</strong>. </p>
			<p>A visual grid is another useful tool that you can use in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view to help you align GameObjects by moving them to the nearest grid location:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.34_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.34 – Toggle the visibility of the grid&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.34 – Toggle the visibility of the grid</p>
			<p>As you can see in the preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> screenshot, you can also move a GameObject to a grid projected along the <strong class="bold">X</strong>, <strong class="bold">Y</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Z</strong> axes.</p>
			<p>The last useful tool in<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view that I want to introduce is <strong class="bold">draw mode</strong> used<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> in the Scene:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.35_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.35 – The draw mode in the Scene&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.35 – The draw mode in the Scene</p>
			<p>This is useful if <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>your project uses the built-in render pipeline of Unity because a different draw mode in the Scene<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> can help you understand and debug the lighting in it. </p>
			<p>In the default<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> layout, the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view also appears in the same area as the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view. You <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>can click the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> button to switch to the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view from the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.36_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.36 – Click the Game button to switch to the Game view &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.36 – Click the Game button to switch to the Game view </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> represents your final published game. The content of the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view is rendered from the camera(s) in your game. In the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view, you cannot modify<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> the viewing angle and projection mode at will, as with the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view. You need to modify the settings of the camera object to achieve this function:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.37_B17146.jpg" alt="Figure 1.37 – The Game view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.37 – The Game view</p>
			<p>You can run your game directly inside the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view by clicking the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button on the Toolbar. It's important to note that in <strong class="bold">Play</strong> mode, any changes you make are temporary and will be reset when you exit it; therefore, it is not a good idea to make lots of changes in play mode.</p>
			<p>I want to introduce three tools in the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view, namely <strong class="bold">Aspect</strong>, <strong class="bold">Maximize On Play</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Stats</strong>.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Aspect</strong> drop-down <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>menu is very useful when you develop games for<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> different<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> screens with different aspect ratios. You can select different values to test how your game looks on these screens, and you even can add custom values by clicking the <strong class="bold">plus</strong> button at the bottom of the menu:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.38_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.38 – The Free Aspect drop-down menu</p>
			<p>The second feature is<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> called <strong class="bold">Maximize On Play</strong>, which can maximize the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view for a full-screen preview when you enter play mode:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.39_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.39 – The Maximize On Play button</p>
			<p>The third feature is called <strong class="bold">Stats</strong>. This feature is useful because it can display the <strong class="bold">rendering statistics</strong> about <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>your game's <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>audio and graphics. Therefore, you can use<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> it for monitoring the performance of your game while in play mode:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.40_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.40 – The Stats window</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view, you can view and adjust the game world you are creating. In the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view, you can see your final game. So, this area is very important in the Editor. Next, let's take a look at the UI area related to a specific GameObject in the Scene.</p>
			<h3>The Inspector window</h3>
			<p>If you want to modify the<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> properties of a GameObject or a component on a <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>GameObject, you need to use the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window.</p>
			<p>You can select a GameObject in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view or the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window, and then you will see the properties and the components of it in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.41_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.41 – The Inspector window of a GameObject</p>
			<p>You can modify these properties <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>directly in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window, which<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/> also provides some useful tools that can help you modify your GameObjects.</p>
			<p>For example, if you want to copy the values of a component on a GameObject, you can right-click on the component, and then a menu will pop up; from there, you can select the <strong class="bold">Copy Component</strong> command:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.42_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.42 – Copy Component</p>
			<p>Not only can the GameObjects in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view be inspected but also the digital assets in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window. You <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>can select a digital asset in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window, and<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window will display the settings that control how Unity imports and uses the asset at runtime:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.43_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.43 – The Inspector window of an asset</p>
			<p>In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> learned how to view and modify the properties of a GameObject and asset through <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window.</p>
			<h3>The Project window</h3>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> final window I will introduce is the <code>assets</code> files in folders:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.44_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.44 – The Project window</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>is the main way to navigate and find assets in your game. It <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>provides two ways to search assets, by type or label:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.45_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.45 – Searching assets by type</p>
			<p>It is very easy to import external digital assets or create an asset inside the Unity Editor directly. You just need to right-click on the Project window and a menu will pop up where you can create a new asset or import an existing asset:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.46_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.46 – Creating an asset</p>
			<p>I hope you now have a good understanding of the Unity Editor by reading this section. Next, I will introduce what a game engine is and what important features Unity provides as a game engine.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Working with different features in Unity</h1>
			<p>Nowadays, Unity is no longer just a game engine but also a creative tool widely used in various industries. However, Unity still retains its game engine roots, and it remains one of the most popular game engines. To learn how to use Unity to develop games, you must first understand what features Unity provides for game developers as a game engine. </p>
			<p>In fact, almost all game engines provide similar functional modules to Unity to game developers. So, the first question is, what exactly is a game engine?</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>What is a game engine?</h2>
			<p>The term <strong class="bold">game engine</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>widely used in the game industry, but not everyone knows what this term means, especially new game developers. So, I will explain what a game engine is and, at the same time, introduce the corresponding functions in Unity.</p>
			<p>A <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>game engine is not just a computer graphics renderer. Of course, rendering is an important function of a game engine, but the process of creating a game is much more complicated than just rendering. </p>
			<p>As a game developer, you need to import different <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>types of <strong class="bold">digital assets</strong>, such as 3D models, 2D textures, and audio, and most of these digital assets are not created inside a game engine. Therefore, a game engine should provide the function of managing digital assets. In addition to digital assets, you also need to use <strong class="bold">scripts</strong> to add<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> game logic to guide these assets to perform correct behaviors, such as character interactions. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">UI</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>another integral part of a game, and even some gameplay is based on UI. Therefore, a good game engine should provide an easy-to-use and powerful UI toolkit to develop user interfaces for games. </p>
			<p>You can use other software to develop<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> animation files and import them into a game engine, but in order for animation files to be played and controlled correctly in the game, the game engine needs to provide an <strong class="bold">animation</strong> feature.</p>
			<p>At the same time, a <strong class="bold">physical</strong> effect<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> is a common function in modern games, so a powerful game engine should provide a physical function so that game developers do not need to implement a physical effect from scratch.</p>
			<p>There is no doubt that <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>adding <strong class="bold">video and audio</strong> to your game can make your game livelier and more interesting. With audio especially, suitable background music and some appropriate sound effects can make your game feel completely different. Even if it is just a prototype, background music and sound effects can make the game more complete and more professional. Therefore, although many people often ignore the functions of video and sound when talking about game engines, I don't think that a game engine without video and audio functions is a good one.</p>
			<p>As you can see, there are many features in a game engine for game developers to develop their games. A game engine integrates all aspects of creating a game to create a complete game user experience. So, in game development, you will deal with different functions. For example, you may need to properly manage digital assets and create appropriate digital assets for your game engine to optimize performance at runtime, or you may need to know how to use the scripting function provided by the game engine you are using to develop logic for your game. </p>
			<p>As one of the most popular game engines, Unity also provides the aforementioned functions. In the following subsection, I will introduce these functions in Unity.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Features in Unity</h2>
			<p>Like other excellent <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>game engines, Unity also provides many functions for game developers. You will be introduced to these functions in the following sections.</p>
			<h3>Graphics</h3>
			<p>The first feature I want to <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>introduce is <strong class="bold">graphics</strong> in Unity. You can use Unity's graphics features to create<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> beautiful, optimized graphics on various platforms: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.47_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.47 – A Unity HDRP template Scene</p>
			<p>A render pipeline<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> performs a series of operations that render the contents of a Scene on a screen. There are three render pipelines available in Unity:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Built-in Render Pipeline</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> is the default render pipeline in Unity. You cannot modify this render pipeline.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Universal Render Pipeline</strong> (<strong class="bold">URP</strong>), which<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> allows developers to customize and create optimized graphics for different platforms.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">High Definition Render Pipeline</strong> (<strong class="bold">HDRP</strong>), which <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>focuses on cutting-edge, high-fidelity graphics on high-end platforms.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, you can also create your own render pipeline by using the <strong class="bold">Scriptable Render Pipeline API</strong> in Unity. We will<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> introduce it in detail in <a href="B17146_08_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor143"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">The Scriptable Render Pipeline in Unity</em>.</p>
			<h3>Scripting</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Scripting</strong> is another <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>essential feature <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>of Unity. You need scripts to implement the <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>game logic in your games.</p>
			<p>The Unity engine is built with native C/C++ internally, but it offers scripting APIs in C#, so you do not have to learn C/C++ to create a game. In the following sections and chapters, you will learn more about the concepts of scripting.</p>
			<h3>UI</h3>
			<p>UI is very <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>important for a game, and Unity offers three different UI solutions<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> for game developers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">IMGUI</strong>)</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Unity UI</strong> (<strong class="bold">uGUI</strong>) package</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">UI Toolkit</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The IMGUI is <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>a relatively old UI solution in Unity, and it is not recommended for building a runtime UI. The UI Toolkit<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> is the latest UI solution; however, it is still missing some features that you can find in the uGUI package and the IMGUI. The <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>uGUI package is a mature UI solution in Unity, which is widely used in the game industry. We will introduce the uGUI package in detail in <a href="B17146_03_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor046"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Developing UI with the Unity UI System</em>.</p>
			<h3>Animation</h3>
			<p>Animation<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> can make your game more vivid. Unity provides a powerful animation feature called <strong class="bold">Mecanim</strong> that <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>allows you to retarget an animation, control the <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>weight of it at runtime, and call events from the animation playback. </p>
			<p>We will introduce Unity's animation system in <a href="B17146_04_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Animations with the Unity Animation System</em>.</p>
			<h3>Physics</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Physical simulation</strong> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>indispensable feature in certain types of games, and some gameplays are even based <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>entirely on physical simulation. There<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> are different physics engine implementations in Unity, and you can select one according to your game needs.</p>
			<p>We will introduce Unity's physics engine implementations in <a href="B17146_05_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with the Unity Physics System</em>.</p>
			<h3>Video and audio</h3>
			<p>Good background <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>music, sound effects, and video can make your game stand out. This is a feature that cannot be ignored. Unity provides <strong class="bold">video and audio</strong> features, allowing <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>your game to play videos on different platforms, and supports real-time mixing and full 3D spatial sound effects.</p>
			<p>We will discuss video and audio more in <a href="B17146_06_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor095"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Integrating Audio and Video in a Unity Project</em>.</p>
			<h3>Assets</h3>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>import your digital <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>asset files into the Unity Editor, such as 3D models and 2D textures. Unity offers an Asset Import Pipeline to process these imported assets. You can also customize the import settings to control how Unity imports and uses the assets at runtime.</p>
			<p>We will introduce <strong class="bold">assets management</strong> and <strong class="bold">serialization</strong> in <a href="B17146_10_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Serialization System and Assets Management In Unity and Azure</em>.</p>
			<p>We've briefly introduced the functions that a game engine needs to provide and the functions provided by Unity. Next, let's introduce .NET/C# and scripting in Unity.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>.NET/C# and scripting in Unity</h1>
			<p>Unity is a game engine written in C/C++, but in order to make it easier for game developers to develop games, Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>provides C# (<em class="italic">pronounced C-sharp</em>) as a scripting programming language to write game logic in Unity. This is because compared with C/C++, C# is easier to learn. In addition, it is a "managed language," which means that it will automatically manage memory for you – allocate release memory, cover memory leaks, and so on.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will introduce .NET/C# and scripting in Unity.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>.NET profiles in Unity</h2>
			<p>The Unity<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> game engine <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>uses <strong class="bold">Mono</strong>, an open source ECMA CLI, C#, and .NET implementation, for scripting. You can follow the development of Unity's fork of Mono on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/mono/tree/unity-master-new-unitychanges">https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/mono/tree/unity-master-new-unitychanges</a>.</p>
			<p>Unity provides different .NET profiles. If you are using the legacy version of Unity, which is before Unity 2018, you may find that it provides two API compatibility levels in the <strong class="bold">Player</strong> settings panel (<strong class="bold">Edit</strong> | <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Player</strong> | <strong class="bold">Other Settings</strong>), which are <strong class="bold">.NET 2.0 Subset</strong> and <strong class="bold">.NET 2.0</strong>.  First of all, if you are using a legacy version of Unity, then I strongly <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>recommend that you update your Unity version. Secondly, both the <strong class="bold">.NET 2.0 Subset</strong><a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> and <strong class="bold">.NET 2.0</strong> profiles in Unity are closely aligned with the .NET 2.0 profile from Microsoft.</p>
			<p>If you are using a modern version of Unity, which is Unity 2019 or later, you will find another two .NET profiles<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> supported by Unity, which<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> are <strong class="bold">.NET Standard 2.0</strong> and <strong class="bold">.NET 4.x</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.48_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.48 – The Api Compatibility Level settings</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The name of the .NET Standard 2.0 profile can be a bit misleading because it is not related to the <strong class="bold">.NET 2.0</strong> and <strong class="bold">.NET 2.0 Subset</strong> profiles from the legacy versions of Unity.</p>
			<p>.NET Standard<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> is a formal specification of the .NET APIs that all .NET platforms have to implement. These .NET platforms include .NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin, and Mono. You can find the .NET Standard repository on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/standard">https://github.com/dotnet/standard</a>.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, the .NET 4.x profile in Unity matches the .NET 4 series (.NET 4.5, .NET 4.6, .NET 4.7, and so on) of profiles from the .NET Framework. </p>
			<p>Therefore, it is a good idea to use the .NET Standard 2.0 profile in Unity, and you should choose the .NET 4.x profile only for compatibility reasons. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Scripting backends in Unity</h2>
			<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>addition to<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> the .NET profiles, Unity also provides<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> two different <strong class="bold">scripting backends</strong>, which are <strong class="bold">Mono</strong> and <strong class="bold">IL2CPP</strong> (which stands for <strong class="bold">Intermediate Language To C++</strong>):</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.49_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.49 – The Scripting Backend settings</p>
			<p>You can change the scripting backend of your project in the same settings panel, which can be found by going to <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> | <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Player</strong> | <strong class="bold">Other Settings</strong>.</p>
			<p>The key difference between the two <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>scripting backends is how they compile your Unity scripting API code (C# code):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Mono scripting backend uses <strong class="bold">Just-in-Time</strong> (<strong class="bold">JIT</strong>) compilation<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> and compiles code on demand at runtime. It will compile your Unity scripting API code to regular .NET DLLs. And, as I mentioned in the previous sections, Unity uses an implementation of the standard Mono runtime for scripting that natively supports C#.</li>
				<li>Alternatively, the IL2CPP scripting backend uses <strong class="bold">Ahead-of-Time</strong> (<strong class="bold">AOT</strong>) compilation<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> and compiles your entire application before it is run. And it not only compiles your Unity scripting API code into .NET DLL but also converts all managed assemblies into standard C++ code. In addition, the runtime of IL2CPP is developed by Unity, which is an alternative to the Mono runtime:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.50_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.50 – The IL2CPP scripting backend</p>
			<p>As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.50</em>, IL2CPP not only compiles C# code into managed assemblies but also further converts assemblies into C++ code, and then compiles the C++ code into the native binary format. </p>
			<p>Clearly, IL2CPP <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>takes more time to compile code compared to Mono, so why do we still need IL2CPP?</p>
			<p>Well, first, IL2CPP uses AOT compilation, which takes longer to compile, but when you ship the game for a specific platform, the binary files are fully specified, which means that compared to Mono, code generation is greatly improved.</p>
			<p>Second, it is worth noting that IL2CPP is the only scripting backend available when building for <strong class="bold">iOS</strong> and <strong class="bold">WebGL</strong>. In addition to iOS and WebGL, Unity has added support for <strong class="bold">Android 64-bit</strong> in Unity 2018.2 to comply with the <strong class="bold">Google Play</strong> <strong class="bold">Store</strong> policy, which requires that starting from August 1, 2019, your apps published on Google Play need to support 64-bit architectures: </p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.51 – The Android 64-bit ARM architecture is not supported on the Mono scripting backend</p>
			<p>And as you can see in the preceding screenshot, the Android 64-bit ARM architecture is not supported on the Mono scripting backend. In this situation, you have to choose the IL2CPP scripting backend.</p>
			<p>So, whether we use<a id="_idIndexMarker140"/> IL2CPP for better code generation or some specific platforms or architectures, spending more compilation time is still a disadvantage of IL2CPP. So, how should we optimize the compilation time of IL2CPP? I think the following tips will help:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't delete the previous <code>build</code> folder, and build your project with the IL2CPP scripting backend at the same location as the folder. This is because we can use incremental building, which means the C++ compiler only recompiles files that have changed since the last build.</li>
				<li>Store your project and target build folder <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>on a <strong class="bold">Solid-State Drive</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSD</strong>). This is because when IL2CPP is selected, the compilation process will convert the IL code into C++ and compile it, which involves a lot of read/write operations. A faster storage device will speed up this process.</li>
				<li>Disable anti-malware software before building the project. Of course, this depends on your security strategy.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Well, I hope that by reading this section, you now have a general understanding of Unity's scripting system, such as the .NET profiles in Unity, the two scripting backends, and some optimization tips for IL2CPP. </p>
			<p>In the next section, you will learn how to set up your development environment and use the widely used Visual Studio to develop games in Unity.</p>

			<p>Before you start<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> writing any code, it is important to choose <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>suitable development tools. Microsoft's <strong class="bold">Visual Studio</strong> is not only a widely used IDE but also the development environment that is installed by default when you install Unity on Windows or macOS:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.52 – Visual Studio Installer</p>
			<p>While installing Visual Studio, <strong class="bold">Visual Studio Tools for Unity</strong> will also be installed. It is a free extension that provides support for writing and debugging C# in Unity. </p>
			<p>If you do not install Visual Studio through the Unity Hub, please make sure you installed this extension. You can check it in the <strong class="bold">Visual Studio Installer</strong>:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.53 – Installing Visual Studio Tools for Unity</p>
			<p>After installing the <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>Unity Editor and Visual Studio Community <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>2019, you can check the <strong class="bold">External Script Editor</strong> settings in the <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong> window of the Unity Editor:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.54 – The External Script Editor settings</p>
			<p>In addition, you can also select other script editors by modifying this setting, such as <strong class="bold">Visual Studio Code</strong> and <strong class="bold">JetBrains Rider</strong>.</p>
			<p>Then, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>create a new C# script file named <code>NewBehaviourScript</code> in the <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>Unity Editor and double-click to open it in Visual Studio:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.55 – IntelliSense for the Unity APIs</p>
			<p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, there are two built-in methods in the script file by default, namely <code>Start</code> and <code>Update</code>. Visual Studio supports <strong class="bold">IntelliSense</strong> for Unity APIs, so we can write code<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> quickly:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.56 – Debugging your code</p>
			<p>It is also very<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> easy to debug your code in Visual Studio. In the<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> preceding screenshot, I set a breakpoint inside the <code>Start</code> method and clicked the <strong class="bold">Attach to Unity</strong> button in Visual Studio:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.57_B17146.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.57 – Clicking the Attach to Unity button</p>
			<p>In order to<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> run this code, I attach this script to a <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>GameObject in the Scene and click on the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button in the Unity Editor to run the game in the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we started by choosing the Unity release and subscription plan that suits your needs. Then, you learned how to install and manage the Unity Editor by using the Unity Hub and explored the five important areas of the Unity Editor – the Toolbar, the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window, the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> view and the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view, the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window, and the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window. You were then introduced to the Unity Editor toolbars and the windows provided by Unity. We also discussed what a game engine is and explored the different features provided by Unity for developers to develop games. We then introduced the .NET profiles in Unity and the scripting backends offered by Unity; you should now know the difference between the Mono scripting backend and the IL2CPP scripting backend. Finally, we demonstrated how to set up Visual Studio for Unity Editor to write code.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will start with a detailed introduction to the basic concepts of scripting in Unity, such as GameObjects, components, and some special, important components such as <strong class="bold">Transform</strong>. We will also introduce you to the life cycle of a script instance. Then, we will discuss how to create objects from scripts and how to access GameObjects or components through C# code. Some best practices for scripting in Unity will also be introduced. Finally, we will introduce <strong class="bold">packages</strong> and the <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong> in Unity.</p>
