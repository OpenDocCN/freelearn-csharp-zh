- en: With the pervasiveness of games and the use of gamification in nearly every
    industry, the desire to discover how to use state-of-the-art development software
    has never been so great. There is an increasing number of software tools available
    to help developers create amazing games for consoles, the web, desktop computers,
    and mobile devices. Game engines are among the most powerful of these tools available.
    The Unity 3D game engine is one of the elite game engines. It has been used to
    create popular 2D and 3D games by large game studios and indie developers. With
    a free version available, and the newest release of Unity, the time has never
    been better to start using Unity.
