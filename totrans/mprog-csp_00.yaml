- en: In the world of software, there are so many things that can go wrong and often
    do go wrong. We’re a relatively young industry that is in an ever-changing state.
    Things haven’t settled and innovation happens at lightning speed. It’s not like
    carpentry, which has had a few thousand years of experience of what works and
    what doesn’t. In software, we’re still inventing the tools and reinventing them
    as we go. The business benefit and the possibility to increase productivity for
    our end users sets the expectations high and in an increasingly competitive market,
    time to market is of the essence.

    the metadata surrounding our own code to ensure the quality and maintainability
    of the software we write. This is where the metaprogramming journey starts.

    help you and your team become more productive and, at the end of the day, deliver
    more business-critical features that are easier to change and maintain over the
    years.
