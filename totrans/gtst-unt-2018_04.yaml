    efforts. We designed all the game's functionality, how to use the player character,
    what role the non-player character will have, what assets we will use, and what
    animations we will use in the game. We also mocked-up the main game screen as
    well as our heads-up display. In addition to this, we made key decisions on our
    game's difficulty balance. With the design work complete, we are ready to start
    creating our game.
