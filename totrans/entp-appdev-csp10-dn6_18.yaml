- en: Just like for us, the health of any enterprise application should be easily
    checkable and, in the case of any anomalies, we should be informed upfront so
    that we can take corrective action without this resulting in downtime. In this
    part, we will integrate the new .NET 6 health and performance check APIs with
    our application and also unit-test our application. We will then learn how to
    deploy our application in the modern DevOps way and also see how to monitor, diagnose,
    and troubleshoot an application in production.
