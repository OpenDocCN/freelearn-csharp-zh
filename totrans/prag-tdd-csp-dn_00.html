<p>As a consultant, I worked with many teams in multiple organizations. I’ve seen teams doing TDD and I’ve seen teams doing unit testing without TDD. I’ve also seen teams that thought they were doing unit testing but were doing integration testing and I’ve seen teams that are doing none! As an ordinary human being, I started forming a belief based on empirical evidence that TDD teams are the most successful, but this is not because they are using TDD! TDD results from having passion.</p>
<p><em class="italic">TDD is unit testing plus passion</em>. Unit testing in some teams is imposed, therefore, the developers have to do it, but TDD is rarely imposed and it is up to the developers to enforce it on themselves. Needless to say, passionate developers produce quality projects and quality projects have more potential to succeed.</p>
<p>TDD is usually combined with some or all aspects of <strong class="bold">domain-driven design</strong> (<strong class="bold">DDD</strong>) architecture. So, I made sure I covered both TDD and DDD combined to be able to give realistic examples. I also wanted to reflect today’s market that is divided between two database categories, relational and document DBs, so I took the liberty to include an example chapter for each and show the differences in unit-testing implementations with the objective of keeping the book pragmatic.</p>
<p>Don’t be tricked by the book size, as the diagrams and the code snippets do inflate the book. I strived to stay away from old and impractical theories to shorten the book and stick to the point.</p>
<p>TDD and unit testing are in most modern job specifications, a requirement for interview test projects, and the subject of hot interview questions. If you wanted to know more about these topics and become a TDD developer, then you came to the right place.</p>
<p>There are many other good books on TDD and they are aimed at .NET developers as well, so <em class="italic">why this book?</em> In this book, I show real practical implementations by going to the DDD world, relational DBs, and document DBs. I demonstrate the decision tree of the mindset that practitioners use when doing TDD. I show the relationship between SOLID and TDD and I introduce a set of memorable best practices known as the FIRSTHAND guidelines of TDD.</p>
<p>My intention for writing this book is to have you as a confident TDD practitioner, or at least a unit-testing practitioner, and I hope I was able to deliver my intention.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>Test-driven development is the mainstream way of designing, documenting, and testing your application from day one. As a developer looking to climb the technical ladder to a more senior position, TDD and its related topics of unit testing, test doubles, and dependency injection are a must-learn. </p>
<p>This book is for mid- to senior-level .NET developers who are looking to utilize the potential of TDD to develop high-quality software. Basic knowledge of OOP and C# programming concepts is assumed, but no knowledge of TDD or unit testing is expected. As the book provides in-depth coverage of all the concepts of TDD and unit testing, and acts as an excellent guide for developers who want to build a TDD-based application from scratch or developers planning to introduce unit testing into their organization.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p>The book covers TDD and its .NET ecosystem of IDEs and libraries and goes through setting up the environment. The book starts by covering the topics that form the prerequisites for TDD, which are dependency injection, unit testing, and test doubles. Then, after covering TDD and its best practices, the book dives into building an application from scratch using domain-driven design as an architecture.</p>
<p>The book also covers the basics of building a continuous integration pipeline, dealing with legacy code that wasn’t written with testability in mind, and finishing with ideas for rolling out TDD into your organization.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Conventions used</h1>
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><code>Code in text</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “The previous code fails this rule, as running <code>UnitTest2</code> before <code>UnitTest1</code> will fail the test.”</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">public class SampleTests 
{
    private static int _staticField = 0;
    [Fact]
    public void UnitTest1()
    {
        _staticField += 1;
        Assert.Equal(1, _staticField);
    }
    [Fact]
    public void UnitTest2()
    {
        _staticField += 5;
        Assert.Equal(6, _staticField);
    }
}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre class="source-code">public class SampleTests 
{
    private static int _staticField = 0;
    [Fact]
    public void UnitTest1()
    {
        _staticField += 1;
        Assert.Equal(<strong class="bold">1</strong>, _staticField);
    }
    [Fact]
    public void UnitTest2()
    {
        _staticField += 5;
        Assert.Equal(<strong class="bold">6</strong>, _staticField);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>GET https://webapidomain/services</pre>
<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: “After installing the local emulator, you need to grab the connection string, which you can do by browsing to <a href="https://localhost:8081/_explorer/index.xhtml">https://localhost:8081/_explorer/index.xhtml</a> and copying the connection string from the <strong class="bold">Primary Connection String</strong> field.”</p>
