    on the main approach for developing cloud-native solutions: distributed applications.
    We decided to describe various options to build microservices architecture, which
    span from serverless implementation to Kubernetes orchestration.'

    on these, bringing an opportunity for developers to understand how and when serverless
    and microservices are the best ways to rapidly and consistently create enterprise
    solutions, thus enabling .NET developers to perform a career jump by entering
    the world of modern cloud-native and distributed applications. With this book,
    you will do the following:'
