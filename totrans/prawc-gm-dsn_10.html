<div id="filepos656636" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Characters</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">It is time to see how characters are created and managed in the game world. When talking about characters, it is the game designer's responsibility to translate into gameplay what characters are, what they do, and what their skills, abilities, and behaviors might be. It is no coincidence that we discussed Narrative and how to write characters first in <a href="index_split_221.html#filepos532760"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 8</tt></span></a><span class="italic">, Games and Stories</span>. Even for the simplest character, a few lines are required to answer some basic questions. These answers, no matter how simple or basic, are going to have a deep impact on the player's perception of the game world.</p><p class="calibre_2">Take <span class="italic">Space Invaders</span>, for example:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00106.jpg" class="calibre_67"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">The main characters in </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Space Invaders:</span></span><span class="calibre4"> the invading aliens and your ship!</span></p><p class="calibre_2">It features only four types of enemies: small, medium, and large invaders and the UFO ship. Nonetheless, writing who these characters are, where they are from, and why they are there is crucial to determining their design and implementation. All the invaders have the same speed and the same attack, and they are all destroyed with one hit. But they come in different sizes that make them more or less difficult to hit. The UFO appears only every now and then, quickly crossing the screen from left to right, shooting down at the player. Just four lines for four enemies. Very simple, yet very descriptive and informative for implementation.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's jump a few decades ahead.</p><p class="calibre_2">Ubisoft's <span class="italic">Far Cry</span> franchise has become famous for its villains. Throughout the five titles released so far, <span class="italic">Far Cry</span>'s villains have become more and more complex.</p><p class="calibre_2">In the most recent installment, <span class="italic">Far Cry 5</span>, the main antagonist is a very complex and controversial character that has sparked many polemics:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00087.jpg" class="calibre_68"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Joseph Seed in the famous </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Far Cry 5</span></span><span class="calibre4"> promotional image</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Let's have a look at a brief description from the game's Wiki:</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">"Joseph Seed is a ruthless megalomaniac who is the founder and the leader of the Hope County-based religious cult organization "Project at Eden's Gate" alongside his siblings who he dubs "The Heralds"; Jacob, John, and Faith Seed. Eden's Gate has used both coercion and violence to bring the existing residents of Hope County into its cult, as ordered by Seed, and, as of the events depicted in the game, is in direct conflict with The Resistance and its members."</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Can you visualize him in an FPS game such as <span class="italic">Far Cry</span>? How do you think he's going to be in-game? What abilities would he have? What kind of challenge will he pose to the player?</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's take another example. What about Yoshi?:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00012.jpg" class="calibre_69"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Yoshi is an anthropomorphic dinosaur in the </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Super Mario</span></span><span class="calibre4"> universe</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Yoshi can jump, use its tongue to grab distant objects and swallow them, and even lay eggs that can be thrown at enemies.</p><p class="calibre_2">You might have noticed that I haven't mentioned any playable characters in the previous examples. Most of the times, in fact, the real stars in a game are not the characters you play as but the ones you meet and interact with, both enemies and allies. Enemies and allies (usually called Non-Playable Characters) make the world come to life; they confront or assist the player and are a fundamental part of any game.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_551"/>


<div id="filepos661231" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Playable characters, NPCs, and enemies</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">There are three different types of characters in a video game:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Playable characters:</span> These are the characters the player directly controls. In some games there is just one (the main protagonist), while in some other games, there are multiple protagonists. Sometimes the player can temporarily take control of an NPC. In other games, there might not be protagonists at all. In a strategy game such as <span class="italic">Starcraft,</span> for example, the player controls units. Some of those units might be unique heroes or commanders, some might be vehicles: tanks or even spaceships. The rules for creating a protagonist such as Joel in <span class="italic">The Last of Us</span> or a Battlecruiser unit in <span class="italic">Starcraft</span> might be very different, but in the end, the principles you use to conceptualize and design them are not so different.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Non-Playable Characters (NPC):</span> NPCs are characters that inhabit the game world, but are not playable by the player. They are controlled by predetermined behaviors designed by the game designer. They are either scripted to follow a precise order of actions and reactions or driven by some sort of Artificial Intelligence (most of the time, it is a combination of the two).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Enemies:</span> Enemies are entities that interfere with the player goals and pose some sort of challenge. They don't necessarily need to be evil entities trying to kill the player. Some enemies might just block the player from achieving her goals, such as the Crows in <span class="italic">Monument Valley</span>, and need to be avoided by finding alternative routes. They don't pose any threat to the main character's life...they just won't let her pass!<br class="calibre1"/></li></ul><p class="calibre_2">In the next paragraphs, we are going to have a look at how to categorize, conceptualize, and design all these types of characters.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_553"/>


<div id="filepos663437" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The function of characters</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Each character in a game should have a specific function, whether they are an ally or an enemy. You don't want to populate your world with characters that don't have a purpose and are just there to fill a blank space.</p><p class="calibre_2">The same is true for enemies. Every time an enemy is introduced in a game, it has to serve a purpose in the overall game experience. Enemies are not just abstract entities on the screen trying to stop or kill the player somehow. Why are they trying to stop the player? Who are they? What are their motivations?</p><p class="calibre_2">It is not important that all this information is actually conveyed to the player. It might well be that she would never know why those alien ships in Space Invaders were trying to invade our planet. Maybe they just shot the player's spaceship because they felt under threat. Maybe it was a peaceful migration? Okay, probably they really wanted to invade Earth and destroy every human on it, but the important thing is that it was actually really clear in the mind of the designer.</p><p class="calibre_2">Each NPC or enemy is an opportunity to deepen the player's immersion in the game world, to offer some help, some fresh challenge, some dilemma, or even just some insights. Characters also evoke emotions in the player. We have seen how important and powerful human emotions are for players. Crafting characters, such as crafting game mechanics and narratives, is a great way to build and convey emotions in video games.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's have a look at some classic characters you can use, their roles, and the emotions they enable in the player. Keep in mind that these categories are not set in stone; they can be mixed with each other and a single character can well fulfill multiple roles, both at the same time or in different moments of the game. Let's learn about them individually - it will be up to you to find the right combination in your games!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_555"/>


<div id="filepos665678" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Friend/Assistant</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A friend or assistant is a very common NPC in a multitude of games. It might be someone that needs the player's help or is offering it. He can be one of the main parts of the plot or even a playable character. Friendship is a strong thing and it can create a sense of bond and belonging. Trust, empathy, joy, and also envy and competition are all emotions related to a friend. Some of the best examples are <span class="italic">The boy</span> and <span class="italic">Trico</span> from <span class="italic">The Last Guardian, Joel</span> and <span class="italic">Ellie</span> from <span class="italic">The Last of Us,</span> and <span class="italic">Lydia (and the player)</span> in <span class="italic">Skyrim</span>.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_557"/>


<div id="filepos666451" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Lover</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Lovers are similar to friends in terms of function in the game and emotions evoked in the player. Some romances in games are determined by the story itself, but some games, especially RPGs, such as <span class="italic">The Witcher,</span> or life simulators, such as <span class="italic">The Sims</span>, allow the player to pursue and live their own romance.</p><p class="calibre_2">Playing with an emotion like love in a video game has been underrated for a long time. With the media and its audience evolving and maturing, love is becoming a very popular theme and less and less stereotyped. You can find some non-stereotyped, great love stories in games such as <span class="italic">Catherine, Life is Strange, The Last Day of June, Final Fantasy, Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age,</span> and many many more!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_559"/>


<div id="filepos667404" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Mentor</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Hello, friend. Stay awhile and listen!</span> This memorable line from Deckard Cain in <span class="italic">Diablo</span> will evoke great gaming memories in any <span class="italic">Diablo</span> fan. Deckard Cain represents all a mentor should be: a wise, knowledgeable character always keen to help and to guide the hero.</p><p class="calibre_2">Mentors are pretty popular characters. They always come in handy to teach the player something, either about the game or the game world. They are fantastic for introducing and explaining the lore of the game world, and even game mechanics. You can quite often see mentors teaching the game during tutorials, for example. The usage of a mentor has become extremely popular in F2P games, where the need to introduce the player quickly to both the game's core mechanics and world lore makes the perfect case for the use of this type of character.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_561"/>


<div id="filepos668466" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Minions (enemies)</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We're going to talk about the bad guys in depth later. Enemies, monsters, aliens, dire animals; they all want to stop the player achieving her goal. Their function in a game is to offer a player a challenge to overcome, to stop her, and even kill her character.</p><p class="calibre_2">But it's not that simple. Creating interesting and unique enemies is an art to be mastered. Their ultimate goal is surely to stop the player, but the real question is how they would do that. We'll have a closer look later in this chapter!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_563"/>


<div id="filepos669213" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Allies</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Allies are different from Friends or Assistants because they bond with the player in a different way. They might be your platoon comrades in an FPS game, such as <span class="italic">Battlefield 1</span>. They're not quite friends or fully developed characters, but they can create a realistic warfare scenario, where the battle is not centered around the player's characters and a multitude of enemies but can develop on different front lines and end up in different scenarios. The emotions connected to allies depend a lot on the player type but they usually evoke some sort of camaraderie. The player could subconsciously adjust her strategy to protect her allies or to pull out some teamwork even in games where the ally's behavior is heavily scripted and doesn't change according to the player's action at all.</p><p class="calibre_2">Some games, such as <span class="italic">Gears of War,</span> have made allies a huge part of the core gameplay. In <span class="italic">GoW</span> support from your allies is crucial to your success and you can even give orders to the team to select the right strategy.</p><p class="calibre_2">In games such as <span class="italic">Baldur's Gate</span>, <span class="italic">Neverwinter Nights</span> or <span class="italic">Dragon Age</span> the player controls the main character, but also the entire party of adventurers that go with him or her. In these games, the difference between an ally and the protagonist blurs, but the player's emotional attachment to the main character remains very strong.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_565"/>


<div id="filepos670863" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Boss</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A Boss, such as other enemies, offers a challenge to the player and stops her from progressing further. But there's something more about a Boss. They are milestones for the player's journey. They can usually be found at the end of a level or an area, representing a physical turning point.</p><p class="calibre_2">They also differ from normal minions in terms of the challenge offered. They are more difficult to beat, usually, as they are designed around new and unique mechanics and require the player to master the game mechanics to be able to defeat them. Some of the emotions related to Bosses are Fear, Anticipation, Anger, Surprise, and Fiero.</p><p class="calibre_2">Some of the most memorable monsters in video games are Bosses. Some games, such as <span class="italic">Dark Souls,</span> have made bosses one of the pillars of their core design. Some games, such as <span class="italic">Shadow of the Colossus</span>, have even brought the Boss concept to a higher level, where every enemy you ever encounter is indeed a Boss.</p><p class="calibre_2">You will learn more about Bosses in the dedicated section of this chapter!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_567"/>


<div id="filepos672206" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Antagonist or the Villain</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Most of the time an antagonist is a Boss; the Final Boss. The ultimate obstacle the player has to face in its journey. Antagonists, unlike bosses, impend over the player's Journey for the whole game, creating a huge anticipation for the final battle and a real sense of hatred and belligerency in the player.</p><p class="calibre_2">It is very important that an Antagonist has a solid, believable backstory, and you need to make sure the player can have a glimpse of it. More than ever, creating a compelling Antagonist is what can elevate a game to greatness. There are some things to consider when designing a Villain; we'll discuss them later in 'The Bad Guys' section of this chapter.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_569"/>


<div id="filepos673125" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Hostage</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A Hostage (even better if it's a friend or a lover) is a great narrative device to twist things around. Rescuing a hostage can change the pace of a story and even twist the gameplay. Just think about how different a shooting game becomes when the objective shift from <span class="italic">Eliminate all the enemies</span> to <span class="italic">Save the hostages</span>. Players may have to change their strategy and play more carefully, as a stray shot or misplaced grenade can result in a critical failure. Hostage rescue is such an interesting gameplay scenario that some games have been designed exclusively around it, such as <span class="italic">Rainbow Six</span> and <span class="italic">Hostages</span>.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_571"/>


<div id="filepos673947" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Vendor</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Games that offer the chance to buy or sell goods...usually need some sort of vendor (unless selling and buying goods happens only using an interface). Vendor characters are very popular in RPGs and action games but they are used across all the genres. The concept of the vendor has evolved further in MMOs, where the player can 'hire' a vendor that enable her to sell her stuff to other players even when the player is not online.<br class="calibre1"/> Some other games, such as <span class="italic">Dead Space</span>, have used the vendor character in the form of a robot, justifying the presence of vendor characters in scenarios where the presence of a human seller is not reasonable or realistic. Usually, vendors are also used to create a feeling of home or a safe place where the player can carry out her business away from dangers. If you are creating a city, camp, or settlement, use vendor characters to give them some life!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_573"/>


<div id="filepos675038" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Quest Giver</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Quest givers are similar to vendors. Instead of goods, they trade missions and rewards. They can also offer some insights on the world lore, or give tips to the player. Characters that give side quests, ask for the player's help, or enable new narrative branches are a great addition to many games. They bring the world to life, giving the feeling that the protagonist is not alone in a static world full only of hostile creatures to defeat. They have needs, motivations, stories.</p><p class="calibre_2">Obviously, there is extensive use of these characters in RPGs. Try to play a few RPGs or MMOs and focus on the characters that give you a quest. Note down what kind of quests they give and how they contribute to the development of the storytelling.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_575"/>


<div id="filepos676008" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Competitor</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The competitor is quite different from an enemy, a boss, or an antagonist. The competitor's motivations can be far from wanting the player dead or stopped. The competitor, usually, has the same goals of the player, and the challenge he poses is to defeat him in the race to this goal.</p><p class="calibre_2">Examples might be other pilots in a racing game, an opponent team in a sport game, but also an NPC in RPG or action games. Competitors spark the thrill of competition, the frustration of losing, and the Fiero and excitement of succeeding.</p><blockquote class="calibre_112"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Exercise</tt></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Play some of the games we have mentioned and focus on the characteristics of each playable character, NPC, and enemy. Can you identify their functions? Do they belong to any of the categories we have mentioned? Maybe to a new one?</tt></span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_577"/>


<div id="filepos677170" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Character Statistics</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">How can we represent the attributes that make a character different from the others? How can we represent, in game, character's traits we have defined with a written description?</p><p class="calibre_2">One classic answer is: "With statistics!" (shortened to just Stats). Stats are a numeric representation of aspects of a fictional character (or unit, or building, or even an entire galaxy). The concept of Stat was introduced in pen and paper RPGs, and indeed is extremely popular in RPG video games, but its versatility and universally understandable concept made stats incredibly useful in many other genres.</p><p class="calibre_2">Stats can be used to represent the physical or mental attributes of a character, such as Health Points (HP), Strength, Resistance, Speed, and Intelligence:</p><p class="calibre_70"><img src="images/00071.jpg" class="calibre_71"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Diablo</span></span><span class="calibre4"> is famous for the huge amount of stats and part of the experience is to optimize and max them out</span></p><p class="calibre_5">Stats don't have to be numbers though. In <span class="italic">The Sims 4,</span> for example, you can define character attributes by choosing aspirations, which will impact some mechanics in the game. It's worth noting that, under the hood, all these characteristics are still numbers in the game's code. How these numbers are presented to players matters. Not all the players want to look at the amount of stats we have seen in <span class="italic">Diablo.</span> And not all of them want to spend time making calculations and optimizing their character's numbers. Different audiences expect and enjoy a different level of complexity, and, even more importantly, not all games need to represent the properties of their world with numbers:</p><p class="calibre_70"><img src="images/00096.jpg" class="calibre_119"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">The Sims 4</span></span><span class="calibre4"> character creation process includes the choice of a number of aspirations to customize the character and give them some unique in-game bonuses</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Using numbers to represent character's attributes is not only simple and immediate; it provides a framework for game balancing. It allows us to compare two characters and determine which one is better than the other.</p><p class="calibre_2">It allows designers to express mechanics through mathematical formulas. If a character has an HP value and a weapon does a certain amount of damage and they are both expressed in numbers...there will always be a function able to transform the weapon's damage into the HP lost by the player when he got hit. (Usually, the number of damage is <span class="bold">exactly</span> the number of HP that are detracted).</p><p class="calibre_2">Even when stats are not represented by numbers, but by adjectives (for example, a character could be <span class="italic">Strong</span> or <span class="italic">Weak</span>) there's always a way to translate words or concept in numbers, and as a game designer it's your job to be really comfortable in doing so and using math as much as you can. We will see, later, in <a href="index_split_398.html#filepos890374"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 13</tt></span></a><span class="italic">, Balancing,</span> how to use those numbers, but it is not only a matter of balancing. Video games are pieces of software where everything, in the end, is expressed in numbers. When you design a system you should always consider this.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">I can never recommend enough rookie game designers to study the basics, such as character creation, by playing Dungeon &amp; Dragons. You just need the rulebook, a few dice, a pen, and some sheets of paper.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> It's incredible how much you can learn from just creating a D&amp;D character!</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> If you haven't given it a go yet, just do it!</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Ok, enough talking now. We're going do a little design exercise and create a new character for a game you have hopefully played: <span class="italic">Overwatch</span>.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_579"/>


<div id="filepos681737" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">A step by step character design</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Games with multiple heroes are perfect for experimenting and putting to test your design skills. You already have a solid base: an existing game with core mechanics that work. Also, you probably have some ideas about what is lacking or what would make a great addition to any game you like and play a lot...so half of the work is already done!</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Read this part very carefully and as soon as you finish, experiment with some character designs for your favorite game. Keep in mind that these sorts of exercises are a very common question asked during job interviews.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> Always expect to be asked something such as "create a new hero for a game" or "what are you favorite mechanics for this character?" or even "how would you improve this character?"</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> The more of this you have done while learning game design, the better and more interesting your answers will be!</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">The steps to design a new character are roughly the following:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Acquire a deep knowledge of the game</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Write down the design pillars of the game and stick them in a place where you can always see them</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Find out what would be interesting to add in the current balance (or unbalance) of force among the existing characters; what is your character's place in the game world?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Write a high concept</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Design the character abilities and mechanics</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Define and balance the character's stats</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">Prototype</li><li value="8" class="calibre_9">Iterate</li><li value="9" class="calibre_9">Final implementation</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Keep in mind that all this is done in parallel or by collaborating with the art team. Your job as a game designer is to make a new character that works, regardless of how is going to look like in the end. The high concept and initial concept art always help in defining abilities, weapons, and gear...but your design should be informed by the third step, first and foremost.</p><p class="calibre_2">Once you find that <span class="italic">sweet spot</span> for a new character with new compelling abilities and mechanics, no artwork or new concept should take the character off the rails. You don't want to end up with a new sniper when you were designing a character to fill the role of a healer (especially because there's already a character like that!).</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's analyze each step.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_581"/>


<div id="filepos684873" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Acquire a deep knowledge of the game</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The first step is trivial, but nonetheless extremely important. There is no way you could design some new content for a game if you're not a true expert of it. We already said this and now is a great time to reaffirm it: be an expert of the game you're working on. Understand the problems, the systems, the level design, the strengths and weaknesses of each character, enemies... everything!</p><p class="calibre_2">Many junior game designers complain that they are asked to have working experience to get game design jobs. There is a way to get that experience without having a job! Deconstruct the games you play, rack up 50+ hours of gameplay and know those games from the inside out. And write it all down.</p><p class="calibre_2">Can you remember any studying session more fun than this! What a job we have chosen!</p><p class="calibre_2">However, don't be fooled by the terms <span class="italic">fun</span> and <span class="italic">play</span>. Unlike a common video gamer, a professional game designer needs to develop her observation skills and focus on her game analysis much more than simply having fun. My suggestion is obviously to play as many games as possible, but make sure that at least 50% of the time you spend playing is focused on this deconstruction experience and not just playing for the sake of playing.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_583"/>


<div id="filepos686442" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Write down the design pillars</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">In order to design new content for a game, you must know what its design pillars are (we won't talk about art pillars, as they are not relevant to this topic). We can't know for sure what they are for <span class="italic">Overwatch</span>, but we can assume that at the core of the game experience there are things like: teamwork, fluid tridimensional movement, character diversity and uniqueness, and fun to watch.</p><p class="calibre_2">Everything you design must relate to the pillars. In our case, this means that, obviously, the new character should be unique and diverse, but in a way that makes her (or him) interesting to play in regards to her:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Movement style</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Specific role and function in the team</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Plus an interesting background that fits with the <span class="italic">Overwatch</span> universe</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_585"/>


<div id="filepos687614" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Write a high concept</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">At this point, you should have enough information to write a high concept. It is similar to what you do would do for an entire game, as we have discussed in <a href="index_split_070.html#filepos210445"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 3</tt></span></a><span class="italic">, Scoping a Game Project</span>. Just a few sentences that give an overall idea of what you have in mind.</p><p class="calibre_2">Examples of some existing characters might work too. Remember, this is an internal document with the goal to explain to artists and developers an idea. So the really important thing is that it does this.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's try to write something for our character.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">The Princess is a secret agent rumored to have worked in the past with both the Overwatch and the Blackwatch. She's an enigmatic woman, a master spy</span>
<span class="italic">and</span>
<span class="italic">infiltrator with a predilection for deceit and sabotage rather than violence and brute force.</span>
<span class="italic">She has access to an arsenal of ultra-hi-tech gadgets and gears, including a term-optic suit that allows her to blend with the environment and become nearly invisible and infra-sight bugs. She’s a mix of James Bond and Major Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">As you can see, I have used what we have defined for the character to be as a base and then I expanded with a simple narrative that will give me some directions in the next steps. The take away here is that you need to start with something really practical; what kind of character does the game need, mechanically. And then you can start imagining what she's like and what background she has, using this new information to keep going with her abilities, design, and stat balancing.</p><p class="calibre_2">Of course, there are times where you start with the concept. There are no strict rules about this. Sometimes you might come up with a concept so strong that everything else will come from it.<br class="calibre1"/> Or maybe you know you need a number of characters and you start fleshing out their backgrounds and appearance before assigning a specific role or function to each of them.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_587"/>


<div id="filepos690018" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Define and balance the stats</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The great thing about creating a new content for an existing game is that we have a solid starting point.<br class="calibre1"/> In <span class="italic">Overwatch</span>, each character is defined by a set of basic stats (HP..), a weapon, and a set of abilities.<br class="calibre1"/> Since we know our character's weapon is going to be a pistol, the first step to define its stats would be to look at every similar weapon available in the game. Once we have our benchmark, we could start balancing this specific weapon against it. We will discuss later in this book how to balance a game (and therefore its smaller pieces, such as weapons or characters).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_589"/>


<div id="filepos690839" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Weapon</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We're going to use all the existing pistol weapons in the game as a benchmark (Wikis online are great tools to quickly find all this kind of information). As we know (because of the concept) that the pistol is going to be some sort of assassin's weapon, we can easily figure out that it should have a suppressor. What would be the suppressor effect in the game? Does it change something from, let's say McCree's revolver?</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's take a look at what I came up with:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00101.jpg" class="calibre_73"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Like the other weapons in the game, our new weapon has the following stats: rounds per clip, reload time, shot type, damage, falloff range, shots per second</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_591"/>


<div id="filepos691880" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Abilities</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">It is time to design the abilities. We know that every Overwatch character has at least one Primary fire, one to three abilities, and one Ultimate. Sometime they might have a Secondary fire and passive abilities.</p><p class="calibre_2">We know from the concept that she has to have an invisibility ability.</p><p class="calibre_2">Are there similar abilities in Overwatch? A few, the most similar is Sombra's Termoptic Camo. So how do we make sure our character relies on that mechanic but feels different? We can obviously play with variables such as duration and cooldown (if it lasts longer, it could have a longer cooldown and vice-versa), but I thought it would feel quite different to balance a longer duration with another mechanic: the more she moves, the less the invisibility is effective, making her more visible as she moves.</p><p class="calibre_2">The idea here is <span class="bold">to suggest a strategy to use the character with her abilities, strengths,</span>
<span class="bold">and weaknesses:</span></p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00085.jpg" class="calibre_74"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">The Princess' 'Blend' ability is designed with an existing ability: Sombra's 'Stealth', which is also used a reference image for the concept document.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">I want her to be deadly with her pistol, but not Over Powered (OP), so her passive ability involves a huge skill from the player (to get the bonus damage on the headshots), but she also has an ability to auto-aim for one single headshot:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00140.jpg" class="calibre_75"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Overwatch's</span></span><span class="calibre4"> characters might have a Passive ability, one that is automatically used without any input from the player.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">The idea here would be to allow a less skilled player to take full advantage of the character's passive ability at least once in a while. At the same time, more skilled players could use the auto-aim at the exact right moment to take out key targets:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00173.jpg" class="calibre_76"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Auto-aiming is a great ability to make a character easier to use. Since it can only be used once every 8 seconds, the player's skill of manually aiming for headshots will still make the difference, but less skilled players can always rely on some help once in a while!</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Another interesting ability, 'Mark', would allow for some great team play. This character could cover a very different role if the player plays defensively and alternates her invisibility power with some scouting around the map:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00001.jpg" class="calibre_77"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">We have discussed how meaningful choices are always fundamental in video games, that's why introducing abilities that allow for more than just one play-style is always a great idea!</span></p><p class="calibre_2">And what about her Ultimate ability? Overwatch's ultimates are designed to create epic moments where the tide of a battle can be reverted completely, a 'Wow moment' of great dramatic tension and definitely a lot of fun for the player unleashing them.</p><p class="calibre_2">As the game is already full of powerful attacks that unleash tons of damage on the unlucky enemy team, I wanted The Princess' ultimate to be a bit different, taking everything she can do with her normal abilities to the next stage. What if she could use her Ultimate to overpower her Blend ability and remain invisible even while attacking and using other abilities...For an insane amount of time?:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00017.jpg" class="calibre_78"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">This is the kind of ability that could easily break a game, so let's be clear about this: it's just for the sake of this book...</span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">don't design this at home</span></span><span class="calibre4">!</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Yes, this ability definitely sounds too powerful, so how do we counterbalance this? By letting her use her abilities only once after the Ultimate is unleashed. So she would have to take the most out of it and not waste a shot!</p><p class="calibre_2">Unlike most of the other heroes' Ultimates, this one would allow for a slower type of play, requiring some tactical positioning and a good long-term strategy. Like other Ultimates though, many heroes can easily counter it. Any enemy could easily detect The Princess before she pulls out her diabolic plan, leaving her fully visible...but with all the down-side effects on her normal abilities.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">You might have noticed that I put quite an effort in re-creating the Overwatch look &amp; feel in the previous pictures. It doesn't matter if the mechanic is not sketched perfectly, or it is using images from other mechanics (or images of a real pistol which has nothing to do with Overwatch)...as long as it gives an idea of what we're talking about! Remember, a game designer is not a concept artist, so it is not expected to deliver quality sketches or artwork...nonetheless he or she should put any possible effort to deliver its vision. A presentation layer is a powerful tool. The more you master it, the better you will be at your job.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_593"/>


<div id="filepos698072" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Prototype and iterate</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We know this already. Once the design is ready, we need to try it in the game as soon as possible. What works in the designer's head might prove terrible after it's implemented. Mechanics need to be tested and balancing needs to be tested. The earlier issues are found, the easier it will be to go back to the drawing board and fix them.</p><p class="calibre_2">Iterating, as we have discussed multiple times in this book, is the key to a successful game. Modern game engines and prototyping tools give us no excuse to be too lazy or too confident and just skip to the final implementation.</p><p class="calibre_2">Unfortunately, we are not able to practically do this and the next steps, as it would require having access to <span class="italic">Overwatch</span>'s source code...but this is what you'd do in a professional scenario.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_595"/>


<div id="filepos699131" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Final implementation</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">At this point, one could think that the designer's work is over. Of course is not. What has been validated in prototyping or testing was sufficient to greenlight a final implementation, but this doesn't mean the new character won't need future re-balancing and some special attention throughout the months following its release.</p><p class="calibre_2">It might prove to be too weak or too powerful in scenarios the designer had not foreseen, players might find an exploit or simply hate it. When you design something and it makes it to the 'released' stage... you have to play it! There's still a lot you don't know about your creation and how it would interact with the other systems in the game.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_597"/>


<div id="filepos700055" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The bad guys</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We have discussed already that every good story puts the characters in front of some sort of conflict. And nothing is better than the personification of the conflict itself: the bad guys! Villains, monsters, and enemies.</p><p class="calibre_2">Despite the fact that all these guys intend to kill the player, they serve the higher purpose of letting the player having fun (while he avoids being killed).</p><p class="calibre_2">But the question is, how are the bad guys designed?</p><p class="calibre_2">The answer, as often happens in game design, is not a simple one and depends on the type of game we’re talking about. Simple enemies, in the same way as the other characters, exist to exert a function. Villains and Bosses do that too, but they also need to be memorable and as interesting as the main characters. Games with deeper narratives rely on well-constructed villains to oppose the protagonist, while more arcade and less narrative heavy games need enemies that offer a challenging focus on the gameplay.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_599"/>


<div id="filepos701331" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Types of Villains</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">There are two kinds of villain a player can face:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Story Villains: A story villain is the kind of antagonist we usually find in books or movies. His function is to drive the story forward, to give the protagonist the motivation to keep going and stop him, to create a dramatic conflict both physical and psychological. Some examples of memorable story villains are The Origami Killer from <span class="italic">Heavy Rain,</span> Big Boss from <span class="italic">Metal Gear,</span> and Jon Irenicus in <span class="italic">Baldur's Gate 2.</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Boss Villains: A boss villain is more focused on the gameplay challenge it poses to the player. It is the boss in <span class="italic">Dark Soul,</span> Bowser in <span class="italic">Super Mario</span> or Diablo in...well <span class="italic">Diablo</span>. They exist to challenge the player to use and master the game mechanics in order to beat them.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Clearly, some Story Villain might also offer the challenge typical of Boss Villains, but what really makes them different is the type of the game they're in and their depth as a character. Like a protagonist, a story villain has his own motivations, backstory, and goals. The less stereotyped they are, the better it is. They're not pure evil entities that act for the sake of evil. From their point of view, they are the real heroes. They think about the protagonist as someone that doesn't understand they are doing the right thing. This is what makes them interesting. Players might even relate to them!</p><p class="calibre_2">On the other hand, Boss villains can be more stereotyped or driven by more visceral motivations. Even with interesting backstories, they don't evolve as characters in the game and that's totally fine! Just make sure you have the right villain for the game you're creating!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_601"/>


<div id="filepos703407" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Types of enemies</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Of course, villains are the main dish. But what would be a game without the common enemies the player has to heroically defeat one after the other, making his way guns blazing or sword swinging?</p><p class="calibre_2">Well actually, <span class="italic">Shadow of the Colossus</span> is a fantastic example of a game where there are no common enemies, but only bosses. But that's an exception and is part of what makes it an extraordinary game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Generally speaking, a game with enemies needs common enemies. Creating enemies is one of the design activities I enjoy the most. Inspiration can come from anywhere, depending on what kind of game you're doing. Enemies can be soldiers from a hostile faction, monsters, aliens, robots, cannibal plants...the only limit is your imagination!</p><p class="calibre_2">One of my favorite resources when it comes to enemy design, again, is a <span class="italic">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span> manual. It's called the 'Monster Manual' and it contains hundreds of fantasy monsters, each with amazing illustrations, rules, abilities, and lore (based on the <span class="italic">D&amp;D</span> setting). It is not important if your game is about realistic modern warfare or set in a sci-fi world. The lessons in this book are beyond the nature of the monsters it describes:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00014.jpg" class="calibre_79"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></span><span class="calibre4"> monster's manual: a treasure of information for the enemy and monster design.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">What we're going to do is try to categorize some enemy archetypes based on their behavior, functions, and characteristics.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let’s have a look at some classics.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_603"/>


<div id="filepos705501" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Chaser/Aggressor</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">This is the most common type of enemy. As soon as the player is in sight, its only objective activates: to kill him. It will chase and attack the player by any means possible until one or the other is dead. You can find this type of enemy in very complex games, such as MMOs (where they decide who to attack depending on how aggressive they are and how much of threat the players nearby are), or it can be more static, like the alien ships in <span class="italic">Space Invaders</span>.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_605"/>


<div id="filepos706168" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Patroller</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The patroller is an enemy that moves within a pre-determined area. Once the player steps into the area, the patroller can either keep moving regardless of the player presence (such as the Goombas in <span class="italic">Super Mario</span>) or change its behavior, reacting to the player presence (for example, shooting or chasing the player, as with the guards in <span class="italic">Metal Gear Solid</span>).</p><p class="calibre_2">It’s important to note that the whole point of the patroller is that it follows a <span class="bold">movement pattern</span> that the player can memorize in order to plan its actions.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_607"/>


<div id="filepos706942" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Guard</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A guard is similar to a patroller, but its function is to guard a particular object or space. While the patroller might just move back and forth within a space, or transform into a chaser as soon as it spots the player, the Guard’s goal is not exclusively to kill the player. So it might prefer to leave the player alone in the case the chase brings him too far away from the place/object it was originally guarding.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_609"/>


<div id="filepos707551" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Shooter</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A shooter is an enemy that keeps his distance from the player and targets her with some sort of ranged weapon. Shooters can shoot regardless of the player's presence (like in some old platform games) or can react to the player's presence. A shooter's behavior can be a subsequent state of a Guard or Patroller. A shooter might be positioned in a particular position, maybe behind a cover - in that case, we talk about a sniper. Snipers are interesting because they force the player to think. Usually shooting them back is very difficult and dangerous, so the player would need to move from his favorite spot and find a way to get around the sniper.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_611"/>


<div id="filepos708392" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Swarm</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Swarming enemies are usually very weak enemies that wouldn't pose any threat to the player if taken alone. Usually, there are many of them and they behave like chasers.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_613"/>


<div id="filepos708751" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Cannon Fodder</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Contrary to the swarming enemies, "Cannon Fodder" is not dangerous even in large groups. They exist to focus the attention of the player, letting him have some easy fun defeating enemies without the risk of losing or being in real danger.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_615"/>


<div id="filepos709188" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Tank</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A tank enemy is able to absorb and sustain the player's attacks for a longer period of time. In case the tank is supporting other types of enemies, it is able to increase the level of threat sensibly, as the player won't be able to get rid of smaller enemy quick enough while the tank is providing cover.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_617"/>


<div id="filepos709682" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Enemy behaviors and stats</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We have defined types of enemies by their behaviors. What about their stats?</p><p class="calibre_2">We're going to delve much deeper into this later in the book, in <a href="index_split_398.html#filepos890374"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 13</tt></span></a><span class="italic">, Balancing</span>, where we'll see how the stats, abilities, and mechanics of enemies are heavily influenced by their function. It is quite intuitive that a Tank type is going to have higher HP or armor values than a Cannon Fodder enemy. A chaser might move much faster than other enemies (and even than the player), but it could lack a ranged attack, or it could be extremely vulnerable to certain attacks.</p><p class="calibre_2">The whole point here is to identify the enemy's functions and the reasons why it is needed in a particular game level or area. That should always be the first step in designing an effective enemy.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_619"/>


<div id="filepos710795" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Enemies exist to entertain the player</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">If a game is based on fighting enemies, make sure the fighting is actually awesome! Animations, visual and sound effects, rewards...all should be tied to fighting and defeating the enemies. There must be a point in fighting them. They must be challenging, but in a way that is fun. If they always outsmart the player, never miss a shot, or always execute the optimal strategy...how could that be fun?</p><p class="calibre_2">Again, we're going to talk more about this when we'll see how to balance games, but in this chapter, it is important that you understand that enemies in a video game are just a tool for enabling fun. Even in a game such as <span class="italic">Dark Souls</span>, based on extremely challenging enemies, where the promise is that 'the player will die', enemies are meticulously designed to offer a great experience...once the player has learned how to kill them!<br class="calibre1"/> Games such as <span class="italic">Dead Space</span> have put great effort not only into the enemy design but also into how the player can actually kill them. Different weapons produce different results while aiming at different body parts can disable a leg or a weapon and therefore allow for micromanagement of the combat strategy.</p><p class="calibre_2">Always design enemies and their systems with a clear vision of their interaction with the players. And give extra attention to their final moment, the one where the player triumphs over the challenge their posing. This has to be great, even for the simplest little creature.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_621"/>


<div id="filepos712544" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Diversity</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">I think it is important to spend a few words about diversity in video games. Historically, video games and the games industry, in general, have a problem with the lack of diversity. With few exceptions, most of the protagonist characters are white males. When they are women, they are too often sexualized (Lara Croft is a great character...but we all remember her physique in the first batch of <span class="italic">Tomb Raider</span> games). When they are homosexual, they are stereotyped, like their sexuality has anything to do with defining what they do and how they act. When they are of different ethnicity, it seems they're there like <span class="italic">tokens</span>, present just to say 'hey, this game has a non-white Caucasian character!':</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00113.jpg" class="calibre_80"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">The </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Overwatch</span></span><span class="calibre4"> heroes: each character comes from a different part of the world and represents a different cultural background.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">There are no guidelines or design practices for this. This is just a matter of sensibility and willingness to explore different cultures, characters, and scenarios in video games. It's the creator's responsibility to move away from the concept that a white male macho-man or a bombshell action girl would sell more and attract more players.</p><p class="calibre_2">Equally, just putting a <span class="italic">diverse</span> character into the game because <span class="italic">we need diversity</span> would only have the effect of highlighting the ridiculous attempt. The idea here would be not to have to talk about diversity at all, as all these different characters should reflect what is actually just normal in our modern society.</p><p class="calibre_2">Diversity is not a status quo or a question like <span class="italic">is everyone represented in this game?</span> All the characters should make sense in the story and the game, with no pre-conceptions about their gender, physical or mental disabilities, sexuality, or ethnicity. All the stereotypes should be left out of your game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Take your time to play some games like <span class="italic">Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</span>, <span class="italic">Persona 4</span>, <span class="italic">Life is Strange</span>, <span class="italic">Overwatch</span> (yes, look at <span class="italic">Overwatch's</span> characters a bit closer!), <span class="italic">Remember Me</span> or Telltale's <span class="italic">The Walking Dead</span>. Think about this very carefully. You, as a creator, have the chance to make a real contribution to this massive issue of the entertainment industry.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">The screenshots used in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only.

<div id="filepos715763" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Summary</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We have seen how to create interesting characters and give them a specific function in the game world, whether they are playable characters, NPCs, or enemies.

Their motivations, backstory, and points of view on the game world.</p><p class="calibre_2">Finally, we made some important considerations about the concept of diversity and how important it is, in our modern society, to keep that in mind as a part of our creative process.
