                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Almost all the recipes in this chapter involve different interactive UI controls. Although there are different kinds of interactive UI controls, the basic way to work with them, and have scripted actions respond to user actions, is all based on the same idea: events triggering the execution of object method functions.</p>
<p>Then, for fun, and an example of a very different kind of UI, the final recipe demonstrates how to add to your game a sophisticated real-time communication of the relative positions of objects in the scene (that is, a radar!).</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The big picture</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The UI can be used for three main purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>To display <strong>static (unchanging) values</strong>, such as the name or logo image of the game, or word labels such as Level and Score, that tell us what the numbers next to them indicate (recipes for these can be found in the <a href="920700d7-96cd-4015-b17c-ee2451bc648e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Displaying Data with Core UI Elements</em>).</li>
<li>To display <strong>values that change due to our scripts</strong>, such as timers, scores, or the distance from our Player character to some other object (an example of this is the radar recipe at the end of this chapter).</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong> UI controls, whose purpose is to allow the Player to communicate with the game scripts via their mouse or touchscreen. These are the ones we'll look at in detail in this chapter.</li>
</ol>
<p>The core concept for working with Unity Interactive UI controls is the <em>registration of an object's public method to be informed when a particular event occurs</em>. For example, we can add a UI Dropdown to a scene named DropDown 1, and then write a <kbd>MyScript</kbd> script class containing a <kbd>NewValueAction()</kbd> public method to do some action. But nothing will happen until we do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to add an <em>instance of the script class as a component</em> on a GameObject in the scene (which we'll name <kbd>go1</kbd> for our example – although we can also add the script instance to the UI GameObject itself if we choose to).</li>
<li>In the UI Dropdown's properties, we need to <em>register the GameObject's public method</em> of its script component to respond to the <kbd>On Value Changed</kbd> event messages:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/2e7f83bb-dd87-4eca-bb4a-f20e054e3632.jpg" style="width:39.33em;height:17.75em;"/></div>
<p>The <kbd>NewValueAction()</kbd> public method of the <kbd>MyScript</kbd> script will typically retrieve the value selected by the user in the Dropdown and do something with it – for example, confirm it to the user, change the music volume, or change the game difficulty. The <kbd>NewValueAction()</kbd> method will be invoked (executed) each time GameObject go1 receives the <kbd>NewValueAction()</kbd> message. In the DropDown 1's properties, we need to register GameObject go1's scripted component MyScript's <kbd>NewValueAction()</kbd> public method as an event listener for On Value Changed events. We need to do all this at <strong>Design-Time</strong> (that is, in the Unity editor before running the scene):</p>
<div><img src="img/3e2ebc59-b702-4b80-aec7-143f8f20b371.jpg"/></div>
<p>At <strong>runtime</strong> (when the scene in the built application is running), if the user changes the value in the drop-down menu of UI Dropdown GameObject DropDown 1 (step 1 in the diagram), this will generate an On Value Changed event. DropDown 1 will update its display on screen, to show the user the newly-selected value (step 2a). It will also send messages to all the GameObject components registered as listeners to <strong>On Value Changed</strong> events (step 2b). In our example, this will lead to the <kbd>NewValueAction()</kbd> method in GameObject go1's scripted component being executed (step 3).</p>
<p>Registering public object methods is a very common way to handle events such as user interaction or web communications, which may occur in different orders, may never occur, or may happen several times in a short period. Several software Design Patterns describe ways to work with these event setups, such as the <em>Observer Pattern</em> and the <em>Publisher-Subscriber</em> pattern (we'll learn more about this pattern in <a href="04f5a183-ae0b-4d73-8e78-c90fd75c9a64.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 16</a>, <em>Design Patter</em><em>ns</em>).</p>
<p>Core GameObjects, components, and concepts relating to interactive Unity UI development include:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Visual UI controls</strong>: The visible UI controls themselves include Button, Image, Text, and Toggle. These are the UI controls the user sees on the screen, and uses their mouse/touchscreen to interact with. These are the GameObjects that maintain a list of object-methods that have subscribed to user-interaction events.</li>
<li><strong>Interaction UI controls</strong>: These are non-visible components that are added to GameObjects; examples include Input Field and Toggle Group.</li>
<li><strong>Panel</strong>: UI objects can be grouped together (logically and physically) with UI Panels. Panels can play several roles, including providing a GameObject parent in the Hierarchy for a related group of controls. They can provide a visual background image to graphically relate controls on the screen, and they can also have scripted resize and drag interactions added, if desired.</li>
<li><strong>Sibling Depth</strong>: The bottom-to-top display order (what appears on the top of what) for a UI element is determined initially by their sequence in the Hierarchy. At <strong>Design-Time</strong>, this can be manually set by dragging GameObjects into the desired sequence in the Hierarchy. At <strong>Run-Time</strong>, we can send messages to the Rect Transforms of GameObjects to dynamically change their Hierarchy position (and therefore, the display order), as the game or user interaction demands. This is illustrated in the <em>Organizing images inside panels and changing panel depths via buttons</em> recipe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, a UI element exists with most of the components that you may need for something in your game, but you may need to adapt it somehow. An example of this can be seen in the recipe that makes a UI Slider non-interactive, instead using it to display a red-green progress bar for the status of a countdown timer. See this in the <em>Displaying a countdown timer graphically with a UI Slider</em> recipe.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating UI Buttons to move between scenes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As well as scenes where the player plays the game, most games will have menu screens, which display to the user messages about instructions, high scores, the level they have reached so far, and so on. Unity provides UI Buttons to offer users a simple way to indicate their choices.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we'll create a very simple game consisting of two screens, each with a button to load the other one, as illustrated in the screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/873bd5cc-73d8-4132-94e1-db89a8f3c865.png" style="width:19.17em;height:3.92em;"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To create a button-navigable multi-scene game, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>Save the current (empty) scene, in a new folder, <kbd>_Scenes</kbd>, naming the scene page1. </li>
<li>Add a <strong>UI Text</strong> object positioned at the top center of the scene, containing large white text that says Main Menu (page 1).</li>
<li>Add a <strong>UI Button</strong> to the scene positioned in the middle-center of the screen. In the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, click on the show children triangle to display the <strong>Text</strong> child of this GameObject button. Select the <strong>Text</strong> GameObject, and in the <strong>Inspector</strong> for the Text property of the Text (Script) component, enter the text goto page 2:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/1c2d5b99-fa37-4e6a-935d-bfe90904ea40.png" style="width:36.92em;height:11.67em;"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Create a second scene, named page2, with UI Text = Instructions (page 2), and a <strong>UI Button</strong> with the goto page 1 text. You can either repeat the preceding steps, or you can duplicate the page1 scene file, naming the duplicate page2, and edit the UI Text and UI Button Text appropriately</li>
<li>Add both scenes to the Build, which is the set of scenes that will end up in the actual application built by Unity. To add the scene1 to the Build, open scene page1, then choose menu: File | Build Settings... then click on the Add Current button so that the page1 scene becomes the first scene on the list of Scenes in the Build. Now open scene page2 and repeat the process, so both scenes have been added to the Build.</li>
</ol>
<p>We cannot tell Unity to load a scene that has not been added to the list of scenes in the build. This makes sense since when an application is built we should never try to open a scene that isn't included as part of that application.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Ensure you have scene page1 open.</li>
<li>Create a C# script class, <kbd>SceneLoader</kbd>, in a new folder, <kbd>_Scripts</kbd>, containing the following code, and add an instance as a scripted component to the Main Camera:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">using UnityEngine; 
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement; 

public class SceneLoader : MonoBehaviour { 
    public void LoadOnClick(int sceneIndex) { 
        SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneIndex); 
    } 
} </pre>
<ol start="9">
<li>Select the Button in the Hierarchy and click on the plus sign (+) button at the bottom of the <strong>Button (Script)</strong> component, in the <strong>Inspector</strong> view, to create a new <kbd>OnClick</kbd> event handler for this button (that is, an action to perform when the button is clicked).</li>
<li>Drag the Main Camera from the Hierarchy over the Object slot immediately below the menu saying Runtime Only. This means that when the Button receives an <kbd>OnClick</kbd> event, we can call a public method from a scripted object inside the Main Camera.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="11">
<li>Select the <kbd>LoadOnClick</kbd> method from the SceneLoader drop-down list (initially showing No Function). Type 1 (the index of the scene we want to be loaded when this button is clicked) in the text box, below the method's drop-down menu. This integer, 1, will be passed to the method when the button receives an <kbd>OnClick</kbd> event message, as shown here:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/77109497-bde4-46a5-bcc2-d7ca372aa435.png"/></div>
<ol start="12">
<li>Save the current scene (page1).</li>
<li>Open page2 and follow the same steps to make the page2 button load page1. That is, add an instance of the  <kbd>SceneLoader</kbd> script class to the main camera, then add an <kbd>OnClick</kbd> event action to the button, which calls <kbd>LoadOnClick</kbd>, and passes the integer 0, so scene page1 is loaded.</li>
<li>Save scene page2.</li>
<li>When you run the page1 scene, you will be presented with your Main Menu text and a button, which when clicked, makes the game load the page2 scene. On scene page2, you'll have a button to take you back to page1.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You have created two scenes, and added both of these scenes to the game's build. You added a UI Button, and some UI Text to each scene.</p>
<p>Note, the Build sequence of scenes is actually a scripted array, which count from 0, then 1, and so on, so page1 has index 0, and page2 has index 1.</p>
<p>When a UI Button is added to the Hierarchy panel, a child UI Text object is also automatically created, and the content of the Text property of this UI Text child is the text that the user sees on the button.</p>
<p>You created a script class, and added an instance as a component to the Main Camera. In fact, it didn't really matter where this script instance was added, as long as it was in one of the GameObjects of the scene. This is necessary since the <kbd>OnClick</kbd> event action of a button can only execute a method (function) of a component in a GameObject in the scene.</p>
<p>For the button of each scene, you then added a new <kbd>OnClick</kbd> event action, which invokes (executes) the <kbd>LoadOnClick</kbd> method of the SceneLoader scripted component in the Main Camera. This method inputs the integer index of the scene in the project's Build settings, so that the button on the page1 scene gives integer 1 as the scene to be loaded, and the button for page2 gives integer 0.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are some details you don't want to miss.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Color tint when mouse pointer is over the button</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are several ways in which we can visually inform the user that the button is interactive when they move their mouse cursor over it. The simplest is to add a Color Tint that will appear when the mouse is over the button – this is the default <strong>Transition</strong>. With the Button selected in the Hierarchy, choose a tint color (for example, red), for the Highlighted Color property of the Button (Script) component, in the Inspector tab:</p>
<div><img src="img/d23e51c5-6e25-4999-91db-d9d8079f5233.png" style="width:38.67em;height:15.75em;"/></div>
<p>Another form of visual Transition to inform the user of an active button is Sprite Swap. In this case, properties for different images for Targeted/Highlighted/Pressed/Disabled are available in the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel. The default Targeted Graphic is the built-in Unity <strong>Button (Image)</strong> – this is the grey rounded rectangle default when GameObject buttons are created. Dragging in a very different-looking image for the <strong>Highlighted</strong> Sprite is an effective alternative to set a Color Tint. We have provided a <kbd>rainbow.png</kbd> image with the project for this recipe that can be used for the Button mouse over Highlighted Sprite. The screenshot shows the button with this rainbow background image:</p>
<div><img src="img/1b4ac2db-ba46-4d00-ab55-88fc75d4f8e0.png" style="width:16.67em;height:2.50em;"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Animating button properties on mouse-over</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>At the end of the previous recipe, we illustrated two ways to visually communicate buttons to users. The Animation of button properties can be a highly effective, and visually interesting, way to reinforce to the user that the item their mouse is currently over is a clickable, active button. One common animation effect is for a button to get larger when the mouse is over it, and then it shrinks back to its original size when the mouse pointer is moved away. Animation effects are achieved by choosing the Animation option for the Transition property of a <kbd>Button</kbd> GameObject, and by creating an animation controller with triggers for the Normal, Highlighted, Pressed, and Disabled states.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To animate a button for enlargement when the mouse is over it (the Highlighted state), do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>Create a <strong>UI Button</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector Button (Script)</strong> component, set the <strong>Transition</strong> property to <strong>Animation</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Auto Generate Animation</strong> button (just below the <strong>Disabled Trigger</strong> property) for the <strong>Button (Script)</strong> component:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/84439d36-92e0-45ef-82a8-734c5ee91987.png"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Save the new controller (in new folder <kbd>Animations</kbd>), naming it <strong>button-animation-controller</strong>.</li>
<li>Ensure that the <strong>Button</strong> GameObject is selected in the Hierarchy. In the Animation panel, select the <strong>Highlighted</strong> clip from the drop-down menu:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/fde4a896-a33a-4d1e-a0f2-29e964ec9a34.png"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>In the <strong>Animation</strong> panel, click on the red record circle button, and then click on the <strong>Add Property</strong> button, choosing to record changes to the Rect Transform | Scale property.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>Two keyframes will have been created. Delete the second one at <kbd>1:00</kbd> (since we don't want a "bouncing" button):</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/dd86535c-4ace-447d-9d88-835b54167f09.png"/></div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Select the frame at <kbd>1:00</kbd> by clicking one of the diamonds (both turn blue when selected), then press the <em>Backspace/Delete</em> key.</li>
<li>Select the first keyframe at <kbd>0:00</kbd> (the only one now!). In the Inspector, set the X and Y scale properties of the <strong>Rect Transform</strong> component to (<kbd>1.2, 1.2</kbd>).</li>
<li>Click on the red record circle button for the second time to end the recording of the animation changes.</li>
<li>Save and run your scene, and you will see that the button smoothly animates to get larger when the mouse is over it, and then smoothly returns to its original size when the mouse has moved away.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You have created a button, and set its Transition mode to Animation. This makes Unity require an Animation Controller with four states: Normal, Highlighted, Pressed, and Disabled. You then made Unity automatically create an Animation Controller with these four states.</p>
<p>Then, you edited the Animation for the Highlighted (mouse-over) state, deleting the second keyframe, and making the only keyframe a version of the Button made larger to a scale of 1.2.</p>
<p>When the mouse is not over the Button, it's unchanged and Normal state settings are used. When the mouse moves over the Button, the Animation Controller smoothly in-betweens the settings of the Button to become those of its Highlighted state (that is, bigger). When the mouse is moved away from the Button, the Animation Controller smoothly in-betweens the settings of the Button to become those of its Normal state (that is, its original size).</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Organizing image panels and changing panel depths via buttons</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>UI Panels are provided by Unity to allow UI controls to be grouped and moved together, and also to visually group elements with an Image background (if desired). The sibling depth is what determines which UI elements will appear above or below others. We can see the sibling depth explicitly in the Hierarchy, since the top-to-bottom sequence of UI GameObjects in the Hierarchy sets the sibling depth. So, the first item has a depth of 1, the second has a depth of 2, and so on. The UI GameObjects with larger sibling depths (further down the Hierarchy and so drawn later) appear above the UI GameObjects with lower sibling depths.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we'll create three UI Panels, each showing a different playing card image. We'll also add four triangle arrangement buttons to change the display order (move to bottom, move to top, move up one, and move down one):</p>

<p>To create the UI Panels whose layering can be changed by clicking buttons, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>Create a new <strong>UI Panel</strong> GameObject named <strong>Panel-jack-diamonds</strong>. Do the following to this Panel:

<li>Create a <strong>UI Button</strong> named <strong>Button-move-to-front</strong>. In the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, child this button to <strong>Panel-jack-diamonds</strong>. Delete the <strong>Text</strong> child GameObject of this button (since we'll use an icon to indicate what this button does).</li>
<li>With the <strong>Button-move-to-front</strong> GameObject selected in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, do the following in the Inspector:
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Rect Transform</strong>, position the button top-center of the player card image so that it can be seen at the top of the playing card. Size the image to <strong>Width</strong> = <kbd>16</kbd> and <strong>Height</strong> = <kbd>16</kbd>. Move the icon image down slightly, by setting <strong>Pos Y</strong> = <kbd>-5</kbd> (to ensure we can see the horizontal bar above the triangle).</li>
<li>For the <strong>Source Image</strong> property of the <strong>Image (Script)</strong> component, select the arrangement triangle icon image: <kbd>icon_move_to_front</kbd>.</li>
<li>Add an <strong>OnClick</strong> event handler by clicking on the plus sign (<strong>+</strong>) at the bottom of the <strong>Button (Script)</strong> component.</li>
<li>Drag <strong>Panel-jack-diamonds</strong> from the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> over to the <strong>Object</strong> slot (immediately below the menu saying <strong>Runtime Only</strong>).</li>
<li>Select the <kbd>RectTransform.SetAsLastSibling</kbd> method from the drop-down function list (initially showing <strong>No Function</strong>):</li>

<p>You have created two <strong>UI Panels</strong>, each panel contains a background <strong>Image</strong> of a playing card and a <strong>UI</strong> <strong>Button</strong> whose action will make its parent panel move to the front. You set the <strong>Alpha</strong> (transparency) setting of the background image's <strong>Color</strong> to <kbd>255</kbd> (no transparency).</p>
<p>You added an <kbd>OnClick</kbd> event action to the button of each <strong>UI</strong> <strong>Panel</strong>. The action sends a <kbd>SetAsLastSibling</kbd> message to the <strong>Button's</strong> <strong>Panel</strong> parent. When the <strong>OnClick</strong> message is received, the clicked <strong>Panel</strong> is moved to the bottom (end) of the sequence of GameObjects in the <strong>Canvas</strong>, and therefore this <strong>Panel</strong> is drawn last of the <strong>Canvas</strong> objects, and so appears visually in front of all other GameObjects.</p>
<p>The button's action illustrates how the <strong>OnClick</strong> function does not have to be the calling of a public method of a scripted component of an object, but it can be sending a message to one of the non-scripted components of the targeted GameObject. In this recipe, we send the <kbd><strong>SetAsLastSibling</strong></kbd> message to the <strong>Rect Transform</strong> of the Panel where the Button is located.</p>

<p>While the <strong>Rect Transform</strong> offers a useful <kbd>SetAsLastSibling</kbd> (move to front) and <kbd>SetAsFirstSibling</kbd> (move to back), and even <kbd>SetSiblingIndex</kbd> (if we knew exactly what position in the sequence to type in), there isn't a built-in way to make an element move up or down just one position in the sequence of GameObjects in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>. However, we can write two straightforward methods in C# to do this, and we can add buttons to call these methods, providing full control of the top-to-bottom arrangement of the UI controls on the screen. To implement four buttons (move-to-front/move-to-back/up one/down one), do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a C# script class called <kbd>ArrangeActions</kbd>, containing the following code, and add an instance as a scripted component to each of your <strong>Panels</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">using UnityEngine; 

public class ArrangeActions : MonoBehaviour { 
   private RectTransform panelRectTransform; 
 
   void Awake() { 
         panelRectTransform = GetComponent&lt;RectTransform&gt;(); 
   }  

   public void MoveDownOne() { 
         int currentSiblingIndex = panelRectTransform.GetSiblingIndex(); 
         panelRectTransform.SetSiblingIndex( currentSiblingIndex - 1 ); 
   } 
   
   public void MoveUpOne() { 
         int currentSiblingIndex = panelRectTransform.GetSiblingIndex(); 
         panelRectTransform.SetSiblingIndex( currentSiblingIndex + 1 );           
   } 
}</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Add a second <strong>UI Button</strong> to each card panel, this time using the arrangement triangle icon image called <kbd>icon_move_to_front</kbd>, and set the <strong>OnClick</strong> event function for these buttons to <kbd>SetAsFirstSibling</kbd>.</li>
<li>Add two further <strong>UI Buttons</strong> to each card panel with the up and down triangle icon images: <kbd>icon_down_one</kbd> and <kbd>icon_up_one</kbd>. Set the <strong>OnClick</strong> event-handler function for the down-one buttons to call the <kbd>MoveDownOne()</kbd> method, and set the functions for the up-one buttons to call the <kbd>MoveUpOne()</kbd> method.</li>
<li>Copy one of the <strong>UI Panels</strong> to create a third card (this time showing the Ace of diamonds). Arrange the three cards so that you can see all four buttons for at least two of the cards, even when those cards are at the bottom (see the screenshot at the beginning of this recipe).</li>
<li>Save the <strong>Scene</strong> and run your game. You will now have full control over the layering of the three card panels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note, we should avoid <em>negative</em> sibling depths, so we should probably test for the currentSiblingIndex value before subtracting 1:<br/>
<kbd>if(currentSiblingIndex &gt; 0)<br/></kbd><kbd>      panelRectTransform.SetSiblingIndex( currentSiblingIndex - 1 );</kbd></p>

<p>You created a <strong>UI Slider</strong> GameObject, and set it to be whole numbers in the range of <kbd>0</kbd> ... <kbd>20</kbd>.</p>
<p>You have added an instance of the <kbd>SliderValueToText</kbd> C# script class to the <strong>UI Text </strong>GameObject.</p>
<p>The <kbd>Awake()</kbd> method caches references to the Text component in the textSliderValue variable.</p>
<p>The <kbd>Start()</kbd> method invokes the <kbd>ShowSliderValue()</kbd> method, so that the display is correct when the scene begins (that is, the initial slider value is displayed).</p>
<p>The <kbd>ShowSliderValue()</kbd> method gets the value of the slider and then updates the text displayed to be a message in the form of <kbd>Slider value = &lt;n&gt;</kbd>.</p>
<p>You added the <kbd>ShowSliderValue()</kbd> method of the <strong>SliderValueToText</strong> scripted component to the <strong>Slider</strong> GameObject's list of <strong>On Value Changed </strong>event listeners. So, each time the slider value changes, it sends a message to call the <kbd>ShowSliderValue()</kbd> method, and so the new value is updated on the screen.</p>

In this recipe, we'll illustrate how to remove the interactive "handle" of a <strong>UI Slider</strong>, and change the size and color of its components to provide us with an easy-to-use, general purpose progress/proportion bar. In this recipe, we'll use our modified <strong>UI Slider</strong> to graphically present to the user how much time remains for a countdown timer:</p>

<p>You hid the <strong>Handle Slide Area</strong> child so that the <strong>UI Slider</strong> is for display only, and cannot be interacted with by the user.

<p>The <strong>Fill</strong> of the <strong>UI Slider</strong> was set to green, so that the proportion remaining is displayed in green – the more green displayed, the greater the value of the slider/timer.</p>
<p>An instance of the provided <strong>CountdownTimer</strong> script class was automatically added as a component to the Slider via <kbd>[RequireComponent(...)]</kbd>.</p>

<p>The <kbd>Start()</kbd> method calls the <kbd>SetupSlider()</kbd> method and then resets the countdown timer to start counting down from 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The <kbd>SetupSlider()</kbd> method sets up this slider for float (decimal) values between <kbd>0.0</kbd> and <kbd>1.0</kbd>.</p>
<p>In each frame, the <kbd>Update()</kbd> method sets the slider value to the float returned by calling the <kbd>GetProportionRemaining()</kbd> method from the running timer.

<p>You created a <strong>Sprite</strong> GameObject and assigned it the Unity logo image. You imported some cursor images, and set their <strong>Texture</strong> <strong>Type</strong> to <strong>Cursor</strong>, so they could be used to change the image for the user's mouse pointer. You added a <strong>Box Collider</strong> to the sprite GameObject so that it would receive <kbd>OnMouseEnter</kbd> and <kbd>OnMouseExit</kbd> event messages.</p>
<p>You created the <kbd><strong>CustomCursorPointer</strong></kbd> script class, and added an instance-object of this class to the sprite GameObject – this script tells Unity to change the mouse pointer when an <kbd>OnMouseEnter</kbd> message is received, that is, when the user's mouse pointer moves over the part of the screen where the Unity logo sprite image is being rendered. When an <kbd>OnMouseExit</kbd> event is received (the users mouse pointer is no longer over the cube part of the screen), the system is told to go back to the operating system's default cursor. This event should be received within a few milliseconds of the user's mouse exiting from the collider.</p>
<p>Finally, you selected the image <kbd>CursorTarget</kbd> to be the custom mouse-pointer cursor image the user sees when the mouse is over the Unity logo image.</p>

<p>The previous recipe demonstrated how to change the mouse pointer for 2D and 3D GameObjects receiving <kbd>OnMouseEnter</kbd> and <kbd>OnMouseExit</kbd> events. Unity UI controls do not receive <kbd>OnMouseEnter</kbd> and <kbd>OnMouseExit</kbd> events. Instead, UI controls can be made to respond to <kbd>PointerEnter</kbd> and <kbd>PointerExit</kbd> events if we add a special <strong>Event Trigger</strong> component to the UI GameObject. In this recipe, we'll change the mouse pointer to a custom magnifying glass cursor when it moves over a <strong>UI Button</strong> GameObject:</p>

<p>To set a custom mouse pointer when the mouse moves over a UI control GameObject,<br/>
do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>Import the provided <kbd>IconsCursors</kbd> folder. Select all three images in the <strong>Project</strong> panel, and in the <strong>Inspector</strong> change the <strong>Texture Type</strong> to <strong>Cursor</strong>. This will allow us to use these images as mouse cursors without any errors occurring.</li>
<li>Import the provided <kbd>_Scripts</kbd> folder, containing the <kbd>CustomCursorPointer</kbd> C# script class.</li>
<li>Add a <strong>UI Button</strong> GameObject to the scene, leaving this named as <strong>Button</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Add an instance of the <kbd>CustomCursorPointer</kbd> C# script class to the <strong>Button</strong> GameObject.</li>

<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong>, add an <strong>Event Triggers</strong> component to GameObject <strong>Button</strong>. Choose menu: Add Component | Event | Event Trigger.</li>
<li>Add a <strong>PointerEnter</strong> event to your <strong>Event Trigger</strong> component, click on the plus (<strong>+</strong>) button to add an event handler slot, and drag GameObject <strong>Button</strong> into the <strong>Object</strong> slot.</li>
<li>From the <strong>Function</strong> drop-down menu, choose <strong>CustomCursorPointer</strong> and then choose the <kbd>OnMouseEnter</kbd> method:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="10">
<li>Add a <strong>Pointer Exit</strong> event to your <strong>Event Trigger</strong> component, and make it call the <kbd>OnMouseExit()</kbd> method from <strong>CustomCursorPointer</strong> when this event is received.</li>
<li>Save and run the current <strong>Scene</strong>. When the mouse pointer moves over the <strong>UI </strong><strong>Button</strong>, it will change to the custom <kbd><strong>CursorZoom</strong></kbd> image that you chose.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You have imported some cursor images, and set their <strong>Texture Type</strong> to <strong>Cursor</strong>, so they could be used to change the image for the user's mouse pointer. You also created a <strong>UI Button</strong> GameObject and added to it an <strong>Event Triggers</strong> component.</p>
<p>You added an instance of the <kbd>CustomCursorPointer</kbd> C# script class to the <strong>Button</strong> GameObject, and selected the magnifying-glass-style <kbd>CursorZoom</kbd> image.</p>
<p>You created a <strong>PointerEnter</strong> event, and linked it to invoke the <kbd>OnMouseEnter</kbd> method of the instance of the <kbd>CustomCursorPointer</kbd> script in the <strong>Button</strong> GameObject (which changes the mouse pointer image to the custom mouse cursor).</p>
<p>You created a <strong>PointerExit</strong> event, and linked it to invoke the <kbd>OnMouseExit</kbd> method of the instance of the <kbd>CustomCursorPointer</kbd> C# script class to the <strong>Button</strong> GameObject (which resets the mouse cursor back to the system default).</p>
<p>Essentially, you have redirected <strong>PointerEnter/Exit</strong> events to invoke the <strong>OnMouseEnter/Exit</strong> methods of the <kbd>CustomCursorPointer</kbd> C# script class so we can manage custom cursors for 2D, 3D, and UI GameObjects with the same scripting methods.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Interactive text entry with an Input Field</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>While often we just wish to display non-interactive text messages to the user, there are times (such as name entry for high scores) where we want the user to be able to enter text or numbers into our game. Unity provides the UI Input Field component for this purpose. In this recipe, we'll create an Input Field that prompts the user to enter their name:</p>
<div><img src="img/b3f06f63-a811-466f-8a4c-e418768a5568.png" style="width:29.17em;height:2.92em;"/></div>
<p>Having interactive text on the screen isn't of much use unless we can <em>retrieve</em> the text entered to use in our game logic, and we may need to know each time the user changes the text content and act accordingly. This recipe adds an event-handler C# script that detects each time the user has completed editing the text, and updates an extra message on screen confirming the newly-entered content.</p>

<p>To create an interactive text input box to the user, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong>, change the background of the <strong>Main Camera</strong> to solid white.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add a <strong>UI Input Field</strong> to the <strong>Scene</strong>. Position this to the top-center of the screen.</li>
<li>Add a <strong>UI Text</strong> GameObject to the scene, naming it <strong>Text-prompt</strong>. Position this to the left of <strong>Input Field</strong>. Change the <strong>Text</strong> property of this GameObject to Name:.</li>
<li>Create a new <strong>UI Text</strong> GameObject named <strong>Text-display</strong>. Position this to the right of the <strong>Input Text</strong> control, and color its text red.</li>
<li>Delete all of the content of the <strong>Text</strong> property of this new GameObject (so initially the user won't see any text on screen for this GameObject).</li>
<li>Add an instance of the <kbd>DisplayChangedTextContent</kbd> C# script class to the <strong>Text-display</strong> GameObject:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">using UnityEngine; 
using UnityEngine.UI; 

public class DisplayChangedTextContent : MonoBehaviour { 
   public InputField inputField;

                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The core of interactive text input in Unity is the responsibility of the <strong>Input Field</strong> component. This needs a reference to a <strong>UI Text</strong> GameObject. To make it easier to see where the text can be typed, <strong>Text Input</strong> (as do Buttons) include a default rounded rectangle image, with a white background.</p>
<p>There are usually three <strong>Text</strong> GameObjects involved with the user text input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The static prompt text, in our recipe, displaying to the user the text Name:</li>
<li>The faint placeholder text, reminding users where and what they should type.</li>
<li>The editable text object (with the font and color settings) that is actually displayed to the user, showing the characters as they type.</li>
</ul>
<p>You created an <strong>Input Field</strong> GameObject, which automatically provides two child <strong>Text</strong> GameObjects, named <strong>Placeholder</strong> and <strong>Text</strong>. These represent the faint placeholder text, and the editable text, which you renamed <strong>Text-input</strong>. You then added a third <strong>Text</strong> GameObject, <strong>Text-prompt</strong>, containing text Name:.</p>
<p>The built-in scripting that is part of <strong>Input Field</strong> components does lots of work for us. At runtime, a <strong>Text</strong><strong>-Input</strong> Input Caret GameObject is created – displaying the blinking vertical line to inform the user where their next letter will be typed. When there is no text content, the faint placeholder text will be displayed. As soon as any characters have been typed, the placeholder will be hidden and the characters typed will appear in black text. Then, if all the characters are deleted, the placeholder will appear again.</p>
<p>You then added a red fourth <strong>Text</strong> GameObject <strong>Text-display</strong>, to confirm to the user what they last entered in the <strong>Input Field</strong>. You created the <kbd>DisplayChangedTextContent</kbd> C# script class, and added an instance as a component of the <strong>Text-display</strong> GameObject. You linked the <strong>Input</strong> <strong>Field</strong> GameObject to the <strong>Input Field</strong> public variable of the scripted component (so the script can access the text content entered by the user).</p>
<p>You registered an <strong>End Edit</strong> event handler of the <strong>Input Field</strong>, so that each time the user finished editing text (by pressing <em>Enter</em>), the <kbd>DisplayNewValue()</kbd> method of your <kbd>DisplayChangedTextContent</kbd> scripted object is invoked (executed), and the red text content of <strong>Text-display</strong> updated to tell the user what the newly edited text contained.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are some details you don't want to miss.</p>

<p>The <strong>Content Type</strong> of the <strong>Input Field (Script)</strong>, can be set (restricted) to several specific types of text input, including email addresses, integer or decimal numbers only, or the password text (where an asterisk is displayed for each entered character).

<p>Users make choices, and often, these choices have <em>one of two</em> options (for example, sound on or off), or sometimes <em>one of several</em> possibilities (for example, difficulty level as easy/medium/hard). Unity <strong>UI Toggles</strong> allows users to turn options on and off; and when combined with <strong>Toggle Groups</strong>, they restrict choices to one of the group of items. In this recipe, we'll first explore the basic Toggle, and a script to respond to a change in values. Then, we'll extend the example to illustrate <strong>Toggle Groups</strong>, and styling these with round images to make them look more like traditional radio buttons.</p>
<p>The screenshot shows how the button's status changes are logged in the <strong>Console</strong> panel when the scene is running:</p>

<p>For this recipe, we have prepared the images that you'll need in a folder named <kbd>UI Demo Textures</kbd> in the <kbd>02_09</kbd> folder.</p>

<p>To display an on/off UI Toggle to the user, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong>, change the Background color of the <strong>Main Camera</strong> to white.</li>
<li>Add <strong>UI Toggle</strong> to the scene.</li>
<li>For the <strong>Label</strong> child of the <strong>Toggle</strong> GameObject, set the <strong>Text</strong> property to First Class.</li>
<li>Add an instance of the C# script class called <kbd>ToggleChangeManager</kbd> to the <strong>Toggle</strong> GameObject:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">using UnityEngine; 
using UnityEngine.UI; 

public class ToggleChangeManager : MonoBehaviour { 
   private Toggle toggle; 

   void Awake () { 
         toggle = GetComponent&lt;Toggle&gt;();     
   } 

   public void PrintNewToggleValue() {

         print ("toggle status = " + status); 
   } 
} </pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>With the <strong>Toggle</strong> GameObject selected, add an <strong>On Value Changed</strong> event to the list of event handlers for the <strong>Toggle (Script)</strong> component, click on the plus (<strong>+</strong>) button to add an event-handler slot, and drag <strong>Toggle</strong> into the <strong>Object</strong> slot.</li>
<li>From the <strong>Function</strong> drop-down menu, choose <strong>ToggleChangeManager</strong> and then choose the <kbd>PrintNewToggleValue</kbd> method.</li>
<li>Save and run the <strong>Scene</strong>. Each time you check or uncheck the <strong>Toggle</strong> GameObject, the <strong>On Value Changed</strong> event will fire, and you'll see a new text message printed into the <strong>Console</strong> window by our script, stating the new Boolean true/false value of the <strong>Toggle</strong>.</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you create a Unity <strong>UI Toggle</strong> GameObject, it comes with several child GameObjects automatically – <strong>Background</strong>, <strong>Checkmark</strong>, and the text <strong>Label</strong>. Unless we need to style the look of a <strong>Toggle</strong> in a special way, all that is needed is simply to edit the text <strong>Label</strong> so that the user knows what option or feature this <strong>Toggle</strong> is going to turn on/off.</p>
<p>The <kbd>Awake()</kbd> method of the <kbd>ToggleChangeManager</kbd> C# class caches a reference to the <strong>Toggle</strong> component in the GameObject where the script instance is located. When the game is running, each time the user clicks on the <strong>Toggle</strong> to change its value, an <strong>On Value Changed</strong> event is fired. We then register the <kbd>PrintNewToggleValue()</kbd> method, which is to be executed when such an event occurs. This method retrieves, and then prints out to the <strong>Console</strong> panel, the new Boolean true/false value of the <strong>Toggle</strong>.</p>

<p>Unity <strong>UI Toggles</strong> are also the base components if we wish to implement a group of mutually-exclusive options in the style of <em>radio buttons</em>. We need to group related radio button <strong>UI Toggles</strong> together, so when one turns on, all the others in the group turn off.</p>
<p>We also need to change the visual look if we want to adhere to the usual style of radio buttons as circles, rather than the square <strong>UI Toggle</strong> default images:</p>
<div><img src="img/38859625-98f2-41a4-8890-2feb6140fa9c.png"/></div>
<p>To create a group of related toggles in the visual style of radio buttons, do the following to the project you just created:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import the <kbd>UI Demo Textures</kbd> folder into the project.</li>
<li>Remove the C# script class <kbd>ToggleChangeManager</kbd> component from the <strong>Toggle</strong> GameObject.</li>
<li>Rename the <strong>Toggle</strong> GameObject as <strong>Toggle-easy</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Canvas</strong> GameObject, and in the <strong>Inspector</strong> add a <strong>UI | Toggle Group</strong> component.</li>
<li>With the <strong>Toggle-easy</strong> GameObject selected, in the <strong>Inspector</strong> drag the <strong>Canvas</strong> GameObject into the <strong>Toggle Group</strong> property of the <strong>Toggle (Script)</strong> component.</li>
<li>Change the <strong>Label</strong> text to <strong>Easy</strong>, and tag this GameObject with a new tag called <kbd>Easy</kbd>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Background</strong> child GameObject of <strong>Toggle-easy</strong>, and in the <kbd>Image (Script)</kbd> component, drag the <kbd>UIToggleBG</kbd> image into the <strong>Source Image</strong> property (a circle outline).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>Ensure that the <strong>Is On</strong> property of the <strong>Toggle (Script)</strong> component is checked, and then select the <strong>Checkmark</strong> child GameObject of <strong>Toggle-easy.</strong> In the <strong>Image (Script)</strong> component, drag the <kbd>UIToggleButton</kbd> image into the <strong>Source Image</strong> property (a filled circle).</li>
</ol>
<p>Of the three choices (easy, medium, and hard) that we'll offer to the user, we'll set the easy option to be the one that is supposed to be initially selected. Therefore, we need its Is On property to be checked, which will lead to its checkmark image being displayed.<br/>
<br/>
To make these Toggles look more like radio buttons, the background of each is set to the circle outline image of <kbd>UIToggleBG</kbd>, and the checkmark (which displays the Toggles that are on) is filled with the circle image called <kbd>UIToggleButton</kbd>.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Duplicate the <strong>Toggle-easy</strong> GameObject, naming the copy <strong>Toggle-medium</strong>. Set its <strong>Rect Transform</strong> property <strong>Pos Y</strong> to <kbd>-25</kbd> (so, this copy is positioned below the easy option), and uncheck the <strong>Is On</strong> property of the <strong>Toggle (Script)</strong> component. Tag this copy with a new tag called <kbd>Medium</kbd>.</li>
<li>Duplicate the <strong>Toggle-medium</strong> GameObject, naming the copy <strong>Toggle-hard</strong>. Set its <strong>Rect Transform</strong> property <strong>Pos Y</strong> to <kbd>-50</kbd> (so this copy is positioned below the medium option). Tag this copy with a new tag called <kbd>Hard</kbd>.</li>
<li>Add an instance of the <kbd>RadioButtonManager</kbd> C# script class to the <strong>Canvas</strong> GameObject:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">using UnityEngine; 
using System.Collections; 
using UnityEngine.UI; 

public class RadioButtonManager : MonoBehaviour { 
  private string currentDifficulty = "Easy"; 

  public void PrintNewGroupValue(Toggle sender){ 
    // only take notice from Toggle just switched to On 
    if(sender.isOn){ 
      currentDifficulty = sender.tag; 
      print ("option changed to = " + currentDifficulty); 
    } 
  } 
}</pre>
<ol start="12">
<li>Select the <strong>Toggle-easy</strong> GameObject in the <strong>Project</strong> panel. Now do the following:
<ul>
<li>Since we based this on the <strong>First Class</strong> toggle, there is already an <strong>On Value Changed</strong> event to the list of event handlers for the <strong>Toggle (Script)</strong> component. Drag the <strong>Canvas</strong> GameObject in the target object slot (under the drop-down showing <strong>Runtime Only</strong>).</li>
<li>From the <strong>Function</strong> drop-down menu, choose <strong>RadioButtonManager</strong>, and then choose the <kbd>PrintNewGroupValue</kbd> method.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Toggle</strong> parameter slot, which is initially <strong>None (Toggle)</strong>, drag the <strong>Toggle-easy</strong> GameObject. Your <strong>On Value</strong> <strong>Changed</strong> settings in the Inspector should look as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/65dd1ee8-292b-4ff6-b111-c2de1efdb65e.png"/></div>
<ol start="13">
<li>Do the same for the <strong>Toggle-medium</strong> and <strong>Toggle-hard</strong> GameObjects – so each Toggle object calls the <kbd>PrintNewGroupValue(...)</kbd> method of a C# scripted component called <kbd>RadioButtonManager</kbd> in the <strong>Canvas</strong> GameObject, passing itself as a parameter.</li>
<li>Save and run the <strong>Scene</strong>. Each time you check one of the three radio buttons, the <strong>On Value Changed</strong> event will fire, and you'll see a new text message printed into the <strong>Console</strong> window by our script, stating the tag of whichever <strong>Toggle</strong> (radio button) was just set to true (<strong>Is On</strong>).</li>
</ol>
<p>By adding a <strong>Toggle Group</strong> component to the <strong>Canvas</strong>, and having each <strong>Toggle</strong> GameObject link to it, the three radio buttons can tell the <strong>Toggle Group</strong> when they have been selected, and the other member of the group are then deselected. If you had several groups of radio buttons in the same scene, one strategy is to add the <strong>Toggle Group</strong> component to one of the <strong>Toggles</strong>, and have all the others link to that one.</p>
<p>We store the current radio button value (the last one switched On) in the currentDifficulty class property. Since variables declared outside a method are remembered, we could, for example, add a public method, such as <kbd>GetCurrentDifficulty()</kbd>, which could tell other scripted objects the current value, regardless of how long it's been since the user last changed their option.</p>

<p>In the previous recipe, we created radio-style buttons with a <strong>Toggle Group</strong>, to present the user with a choice of one of many options. Another way to offer a range of choices is with a drop-down menu. Unity provides the <strong>UI Dropdown</strong> control for such menus. In this recipe, we'll offer the user a drop-down choice for the suit of a deck of cards (hearts, clubs, diamonds, or spades).</p>
<p>Note, the <strong>UI Dropdown</strong> created by default includes a scrollable area, in case there isn't space for all the options. We'll learn how to remove the GameObjects and components, to reduce complexity when such a feature is not required.</p>
<p>Then we'll learn how to add icon images with each menu option, as shown in the screenshot:</p>

<p>To create a <strong>UI Dropdown</strong> control GameObject, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>Add <strong>UI Dropdown</strong> to the scene.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong>, for the <strong>Dropdown (Script)</strong> component, change the list of <strong>Options</strong> from Option A, Option B, and Option C to Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, and Spades. You'll need to click the plus (<strong>+</strong>) button to add space for the fourth option of <strong>Spades</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Add an instance of the C# script class called <kbd>DropdownManager</kbd> to the <strong>Dropdown</strong> GameObject:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">using UnityEngine; 
using UnityEngine.UI; 

public class DropdownManager : MonoBehaviour  { 
    private Dropdown dropdown; 

    private void Awake() { 
        dropdown = GetComponent&lt;Dropdown&gt;(); 
    } 

    public void PrintNewValue() { 
        int currentValue = dropdown.value; 
        print ("option changed to = " + currentValue); 
   } 
} </pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>With the <strong>Dropdown</strong> GameObject selected, add an <strong>On Value Changed</strong> event to the list of event handlers for the <strong>Dropdown</strong> <strong>(Script)</strong> component, click on the plus (<strong>+</strong>) button to add an event-handler slot, and drag <strong>Dropdown</strong> into the <strong>Object</strong> slot.</li>
<li>From the <strong>Function</strong> drop-down menu, choose <strong>DropdownManager</strong> and then choose the <kbd>PrintNewValue</kbd> method.</li>
<li>Save and run the <strong>Scene</strong>. Each time you change the <strong>Dropdown</strong>, the <strong>On Value Changed</strong> event will fire, and you'll see a new text message printed into the <strong>Console</strong> window by our script, stating the <strong>Integer</strong> index of the chosen <strong>Dropdown</strong> value (<kbd>0</kbd> for the first item, <kbd>1</kbd> for the second item and so on):</li>

<ol start="8">
<li>Select the <strong>Template</strong> child GameObject of the <strong>Dropdown</strong> in the <strong>Project</strong> panel, and in its <strong>Rect Transform</strong> reduce its height to <kbd>50</kbd>. When you run the <strong>Scene</strong>, you should see a scrollable area, since not all options fit within the <strong>Template's</strong> height:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/2ba11998-516a-47aa-ac44-bf08d8837fa5.png" style="width:12.42em;height:6.58em;"/></div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Delete the <strong>Scrollbar</strong> child of the <strong>Template</strong> GameObject, and remove the <strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong> component of the <strong>Template</strong> GameObject. When you run the <strong>Scene</strong> now, you'll only see the first two options (<strong>Hearts</strong> and <strong>Clubs</strong>), with no way to access the other two options. When you are sure your <strong>Template's</strong> height is sufficient for all its options, you can safely remove these scrollable options to simplify the GameObjects in your scene.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you create a Unity <strong>UI DropDown</strong> GameObject, it comes with several components and child GameObjects automatically – <strong>Label</strong>, <strong>Arrow</strong>, and <strong>Template</strong> (and <strong>ViewPort</strong> and <strong>Scrollbar</strong>, and so on). <strong>Dropdowns</strong> work by duplicating the <strong>Template</strong> GameObject for each of the <strong>Options</strong> listed in the <strong>Dropdown (Script)</strong> component. Both <strong>Text</strong> and <strong>Sprite</strong> image values can be given for each option. The properties of the <strong>Template</strong> GameObject are used to control the visual style and behavior of the <strong>Dropdown's</strong> thousands of possible settings.</p>
<p>You first replaced the default options (Option A, Option B, and so on) in the <strong>Dropdown (Script)</strong> component. You then created a C# script class, <kbd>DropdownManager</kbd>, that when attached to your <strong>Dropdown</strong>, and having its <kbd>PrintNewValue</kbd> method registered for <strong>On Value Changed</strong> events, means that we can see the <strong>Integer</strong> index of the option each time the user changes their choice. Item index values start counting at zero (as with many computing items), so <kbd>0</kbd> for the first item, <kbd>1</kbd> for the second item, and so on.</p>
<p>Since the default <strong>Dropdown</strong> GameObject created includes a <strong>Scroll Rect (Script)</strong> component and a <strong>Scrollbar</strong> child GameObject, when you reduced the height of the <strong>Template</strong>, you could still scroll through the options. You then removed these items so that your <strong>Dropdown</strong> had no scrolling feature anymore.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are some details you don't want to miss.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding images to a Dropdown control</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are two pairs of items Unity uses to manage how <strong>Text</strong> and <strong>Images</strong> are displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Caption Text</strong> and <strong>Image</strong> GameObjects are used to control how the currently-selected item for the <strong>Dropdown</strong> is displayed – the part of the <strong>Dropdown</strong> we always see, whether the <strong>Dropdown</strong> is being interacted with or not.</li>
<li>The <strong>Item Text</strong> and <strong>Image</strong> GameObjects are part of the <strong>Template</strong> GameObject, and they define how each option is displayed as a row when the <strong>Dropdown</strong> menu items are being displayed – the rows displayed when the user is actively working with the <strong>Dropdown</strong> GameObject.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have to add an <strong>Image</strong> in two places (<strong>Caption</strong> and <strong>Template</strong> Item), in order to get a <strong>Dropdown</strong> working fully with image icons for each option.</p>
<p>To add a <strong>Sprite</strong> image with each <strong>Text</strong> item in the <strong>Dropdown</strong>, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import the provided <kbd>Images</kbd> folder.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong>, for the <strong>Dropdown (Script)</strong> component, for each item in the list of <strong>Options</strong> <strong>Hearts</strong>, <strong>Clubs</strong>, <strong>Diamonds</strong>, and <strong>Spades</strong>, drag the associated <strong>Sprite</strong> image from the <kbd>card_suits</kbd> folder in the <strong>Project</strong> panel (<kbd>hearts.png</kbd> for <strong>Hearts</strong>, and so on).</li>
<li>Add a <strong>UI Image</strong> in the <strong>Project</strong> panel, and child this <strong>Image</strong> to the <strong>Dropdown</strong> GameObject.</li>
<li>Drag the <kbd>hearts.png</kbd> Image from the <strong>Project</strong> panel into the <strong>Source Image</strong> property of the <strong>Image (Script)</strong> for the <strong>Image</strong> GameObject. Size this Image to <kbd>25</kbd> x <kbd>25</kbd> in the <strong>Rect Transform</strong>, and drag it over the letter "<strong>H</strong>" in "<strong>Hearts</strong>" in the <strong>Label</strong> GameObject.</li>
<li>Move the <strong>Label</strong> GameObject to the right of the hearts image.</li>
<li>With <strong>Dropdown</strong> Selected in the <strong>Project</strong> panel, drag the <strong>Image</strong> GameObject into the <strong>Caption Image</strong> property of the <strong>Dropdown (Script)</strong> component.</li>
<li>Enable the <strong>Template</strong> GameObject (usually it is disabled).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>Duplicate the <strong>Image</strong> GameObject child of <strong>Dropdown</strong>, and name the copy <strong>Item Image</strong>. Child this <strong>Image</strong> in between the <strong>Item</strong> <strong>Background</strong> and <strong>Item Checkmark</strong> GameObjects that are in <strong>Dropdown-Template-Content-Item</strong> (the <strong>Item Image</strong> needs to appear below the white <strong>Item Background Image</strong>, otherwise it will be covered by the background and not be visible).</li>
<li>Since items in the <strong>Dropdown</strong> are slightly smaller, resize Item Image to be <kbd>20</kbd> x <kbd>20</kbd> in its <strong>Rect Transform</strong>.</li>
<li>Position <strong>Item Image</strong> over the "<strong>O</strong>" of "<strong>Option A</strong>" of <strong>Item Text</strong>, and then move <strong>Item Text</strong> to the right so that the icon and text are not on top of each other.</li>
<li>With <strong>Dropdown</strong> Selected in the <strong>Project</strong> panel, drag the <strong>Item Image</strong> GameObject into the <strong>Item Image</strong> property of the D<strong>ropdown (Script)</strong> component:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/7688bad7-9deb-4c0b-a0b7-3ad351c1acaa.png"/></div>

<li style="padding-left: 30px">Disable the <strong>Template</strong> GameObject, then run the scene to see your <strong>Dropdown</strong> with icon images for each menu option.</li>

<p>A radar displays the locations of other objects relative to the player, usually based on a circular display, where the center represents the player, and each graphical blip indicates how far away and what relative direction objects are to the player. Sophisticated radar displays will display different categories of objects with different colored or shaped blip icons.</p>
<p>In the screenshot, we can see two red square blips, indicating the relative position of the two red cube GameObjects tagged Cube near the player, and a yellow circle blip indicating the relative position of the yellow sphere GameObject tagged Sphere. The green circle radar background image gives the impression of an aircraft control tower radar or something similar:</p>

<p>Run your game. You will see two red squares and one yellow circle on the radar, showing the relative positions of the red cubes and yellow sphere. If you move too far away, the blips will disappear.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A radar background is displayed on the screen. The center of this circular image represents the position of the player's character. You have created two prefabs; one for red square images to represent each red cube found within the radar distance, and one for yellow circles to represent yellow sphere GameObjects.</p>
<p>The <kbd>Radar</kbd> C# script class has been added to the radar <strong>UI Image</strong> GameObject. This class defines four public variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>insideRadarDistance</strong>: This value defines the maximum distance in the scene that an object may be from the player to still be included on the radar (objects further than this distance will not be displayed on the radar).</li>
<li><strong>blipSizePercentage</strong>: This public variable allows the developer to decide how large each blip will be, as a proportion of the radar's image.</li>
<li><strong>rawImageBlipCube</strong> and <strong>rawImageBlipSphere</strong>: These are references to the prefab UI RawImages that are to be used to visually indicate the relative distance and position of cubes and spheres on the radar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since there is a lot happening in the code for this recipe, each method will be described in its own section.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Start() method</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <kbd>Start()</kbd> method first caches a reference to the <strong>Raw Image</strong> of the radar background image. Then it caches a reference to the <strong>Transform</strong> component of the player's character (tagged as <kbd>Player</kbd>). This allows the scripted object to know about the position of the Player's character in each frame. Next, the width and height of the radar image are cached – so, the relative positions for blips can be calculated, based on the size of this background radar image. Finally, the size of each blip (<kbd>blipWidth</kbd> and <kbd>blipHeight</kbd>) is calculated, using the <kbd>blipSizePercentage</kbd> public variable.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Update() method</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <kbd>Update()</kbd> method calls the <kbd>RemoveAllBlips()</kbd> method, which removes any old <strong>RawImage</strong> UI GameObjects of cubes and spheres that might currently be displayed. If we didn't remove old blips before creating the new ones, then you'd see "tails" behind each blip as new ones are created in different positions – which could actually be an interesting effect.</p>
<p>Next, the <kbd>FindAndDisplayBlipsForTag(...)</kbd> method is called twice. First, for the objects tagged <kbd>Cube</kbd>, to be represented on the radar with the <kbd>rawImageBlipCube</kbd> prefab and then again for objects tagged <kbd>Sphere</kbd>, to be represented on the radar with the <kbd>rawImageBlipSphere</kbd> prefab. As you might expect, most of the hard work for the radar is to be performed by the <kbd>FindAndDisplayBlipsForTag(...)</kbd> method.</p>
<p>This code is a simple approach to creating a radar. It is very inefficient to make repeated calls to <kbd>FindGameObjectWithTag("Blip")</kbd> for every frame from the <kbd>Update()</kbd> method. In a real game, it would be much better to cache all created blips in something such as a <kbd>List</kbd> or <kbd>ArrayList</kbd>, and then simply loop through that list each time.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The FindAndDisplayBlipsForTag(...) method</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This method inputs two parameters: the string tag for the objects to be searched for, and a reference to the <kbd>RawImage</kbd> prefab to be displayed on the radar for any such tagged objects within the range.</p>
<p>First, the current position of the player's character is retrieved from the cached player <strong>Transform</strong> variable. Next, an array is constructed, referring to all GameObjects in the scene that have the provided tag. This array of GameObjects is looped through, and for each GameObject, the following actions are performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The position of the target GameObject is retrieved.</li>
<li>The distance from this target position to the player's position is calculated.</li>
<li>If this distance is within the range (less than or equal to <kbd>insideRadarDistance</kbd>), then the <kbd>CalculateBlipPositionAndDrawBlip(...)</kbd> method is called.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The CalculateBlipPositionAndDrawBlip (...) method</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This method inputs three parameters: the position of the player, the position of the target, and a reference to the prefab of the blip to be drawn.</p>
<p>Three steps are now required to get the blip for this object to appear on the radar:</p>
<ol>
<li>The normalized position of the target is calculated by calling <kbd>NormalizedPosition(...)</kbd></li>
<li>The position of the blip on the radar is calculated from this normalized position by calling <kbd>CalculateBlipPosition(...)</kbd></li>
<li>The <kbd>RawImage</kbd> blip is displayed by calling <kbd>DrawBlip(...)</kbd> and passing the blip position and the reference to the RawImage prefab that is to be created there</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The NormalisedPosition(...) method</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <kbd>NormalizedPosition(...)</kbd> method inputs the player's character position and the target GameObject position. It has the goal of outputting the relative position of the target to the player, returning a <strong>Vector3</strong> object with a triplet of X, Y, and Z values. Note that since the radar is only 2D, we ignore the Y-value of target GameObjects. So, the Y-value of the <strong>Vector3</strong> object returned by this method will always be <kbd>0</kbd>. So, for example, if a target was at exactly the same location as the player, the returned X, Y, Z <strong>Vector3</strong> object would be <kbd>(0, 0, 0)</kbd>.</p>
<p>Since we know that the target GameObject is no further from the player's character than <kbd>insideRadarDistance</kbd>, we can calculate a value in the <kbd>-1 ... 0 ... +1</kbd> range for the X and Z axis by finding the distance on each axis from the target to the player, and then dividing it by <kbd>insideRadarDistance</kbd>. An X-value of <kbd>-1</kbd> means that the target is fully to the left of the player (at a distance that is equal to insideRadarDistance), and +1 means it is fully to the right. A value of 0 means that the target has the same X position as the player's character. Likewise, for <kbd>-1 ... 0 ... +1</kbd> values in the Z-axis (this axis represents how far, in front or behind us an object, is located, which will be mapped to the vertical axis in our radar).</p>
<p>Finally, this method constructs and returns a new <strong>Vector3</strong> object, with the calculated X and Z normalized values, and a Y-value of zero.</p>
<div><strong>The normalized position</strong><br/>
<br/> A normalized value is one that has been simplified in some way, so the context has been abstracted away. In this recipe, what we are interested in is where an object is relative to the player. So, our normal form is to get a value of the X and Z position of a target in the <kbd>-1</kbd> to <kbd>+1</kbd> range for each axis. Since we are only considering GameObject within our <kbd>insideRadarDistance</kbd> value, we can map these normalized target positions directly onto the location of the radar image in our UI.</div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The CalculateBlipPosition(...) method</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>First, we calculate <kbd>angleToTarget</kbd>: the angle from <kbd>(0, 0, 0)</kbd> to our normalized target position.</p>
<p>Next, we calculate <kbd>anglePlayer</kbd>: the angle the player's character is facing. This recipe makes use of the yaw angle of the rotation, which is the rotation about the Y-axis, that is, the direction that a character controller is facing. This can be found in the Y component of a GameObject's <kbd>eulerAngles</kbd> component of its transform. You can imagine looking from above and down at the character controller, and see what direction they are facing – this is what we are trying to display graphically with the radar.</p>
<p>Our desired radar angle (the <kbd>angleRadarDegrees</kbd> variable) is calculated by subtracting the player's direction angle from the angle between the target and player, since a radar displays the relative angle from the direction that the player is facing, to the target object. In mathematics, an angle of zero indicates an east direction. To correct this, we need to also subtract <kbd>90</kbd> degrees from the angle.</p>
<p>The angle is then converted into radians, since this is required for the Unity trigonometry methods. We then multiply the <kbd>Sin()</kbd> and <kbd>Cos()</kbd> results by our normalized distances to calculate the X and Y values, respectively (see the following diagram):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/0a325868-bf9e-4c56-8f79-8b4bd53b460d.png" style="width:24.33em;height:19.92em;"/></p>
<p>In this figure, alpha is the angle between player and target object, "a" is the adjacent side, "h" is the hypotenuse, and "o" is the side opposite the angle.</p>
<p>Our final position values need to be expressed as pixel lengths, relative to the center of the radar. So, we multiply our <kbd>blipX</kbd> and <kbd>blipY</kbd> values by half the width and the height of the radar; note that we multiply only with half the width, since these values are relative to the center of the radar. We then add half the width and height of the radar image to the blipX/Y values. So, these values are now positioned relative to the center.</p>
<p>Finally, a new <strong>Vector2</strong> object is created and returned, passing back these final calculated X and Y pixel values for the position of our blip icon.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The DrawBlip() method</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <kbd>DrawBlip()</kbd> method takes the input parameters of the position of the blip (as a <strong>Vector2</strong> X, Y pair), and the reference to the <strong>RawImage</strong> prefab to be created at that location on the radar.</p>
<p>A new GameObject is created (Instantiated) from the prefab, and is parented to the <strong>radar</strong> GameObject (of which the scripted object is also a component). A reference is retrieved from the <strong>Rect Transform</strong> of the new <strong>RawImage</strong> GameObject that has been created for the blip. Calls to the Unity <strong>RectTransform</strong> method <br/>
<kbd>SetInsetAndSizeFromParentEdge(...)</kbd>  result in the blip GameObject being positioned at the provided horizontal and vertical locations over the radar image, regardless of where in the Game panel the background radar image has been located.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are some details you don't want to miss.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adapt for object heights and opaque obstacles</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This radar script scans 360 degrees all around the player, and only considers straight line distances in the X-Z plane. So, the distances in this radar are not affected by any height difference between the player and target GameObjects. The script can be adapted to ignore targets whose height is more than some threshold different to the player's height.</p>
<p>Also, as presented, this recipe radar sees through <em>everything</em>, even if there are obstacles between the player and the target. The recipe can be extended to not show obscured targets through the use of the Ray Casting techniques. See the Unity scripting reference for more details about ray-casting: <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html">http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html</a>.</p>
