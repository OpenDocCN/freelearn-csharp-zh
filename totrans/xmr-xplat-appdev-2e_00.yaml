- en: 'Xamarin has built three core products for developing iOS and Android applications
    in C#: Xamarin Studio, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android. Xamarin gives you direct
    access to the native APIs on each platform and the flexibility to share C# code
    between platforms. Using Xamarin and C#, you get better productivity when compared
    to Java or Objective-C, and still retain great performance compared to an HTML
    or a JavaScript solution.'

- en: In this book, we will develop a real-world sample application to demonstrate
    what you can do with Xamarin technologies, and build on core platform concepts
    for iOS and Android. We will also cover advanced topics such as push notifications,
    retrieving contacts, using the camera, and GPS location. With Xamarin 3, a new
    framework was introduced called Xamarin.Forms. We will cover the basics of Xamarin.Forms
    and how you can apply it to cross-platform development. Finally, we will walk
    through what it takes to submit your application to the Apple App Store and Google
    Play.

    Apple requires iOS applications to be compiled on a Mac, so Xamarin does as well.
    You will also need a license of the business edition of Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS.
    A free 30-day trial is also available. You can also try the free starter edition
    of Xamarin, but some of the more advanced examples will not work with this edition.
