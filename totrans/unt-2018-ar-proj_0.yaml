- en: Welcome to *Unity 2018 Augmented Reality Projects*. This book is designed for
    programmers looking to step out of their comfort zones and take the leap into
    learning about **Augmented Reality** (**AR**) and how to create projects within
    Unity with it. We will focus on Android, iOS, and Windows devices and dive deep
    into understanding the fundamentals of getting started with this amazing and ever-growing
    technology.

- en: To get the most out of this book, you should have some knowledge of the Unity
    Editor, UI, and build processes. In addition to this, it is highly advised that
    you have some skill with C# that is above the beginners' level, as this book does
    not go into how to write C# code. Lastly, it is suggested that you should have,
    at the very least, taken a look at other programming languages, such as Swift,
    Objective-C, C, C++, and Java, and are able to get the gist of what is happening
    with the code that you will encounter in this book at a glance.
