It is still often associated uniquely with creating the rules of a game, establishing a system, defining what the game will be in broad brushstrokes and then creating particular gameplay scenarios or levels. Sometimes, we go a little farther and endow game designers with the power to define how the game's universe and aesthetics will work. Broad as this definition might seem, it remains very limited in one area, and that is technology.</p><p>As the game industry moves toward its maturation, many small studios begin to emerge, often teams of one, two, or three individuals, attributing their success to the new generation of tools now available to game developers. While the larger game companies employing hundreds of developers have mostly been able to stand their ground, in this new landscape, the focus has already shifted toward polyvalence and self-sufficiency.</p><p>Game designers have always wanted more control over the games that they make, and, for the first time in history, there is no reason why they should not reach out and take it. Knowing how your game works on the inside means having more control and creative freedom. It also means more effective communication with other members of the team, provided there are any. It empowers you to go ahead and simply make the game on your own, be it a mere prototype, a game jam project, or a full commercial release.</p><p>Unity 3D is a game authoring tool that has changed the way we think about game development forever, making it much cheaper and more democratic. It allows anyone willing to invest their time into it to craft amazing game worlds and experiences for next to nothing. It has been one of the major forces driving this incredible change, with millions of new developers joining the game industry simply because they can now. The industry becomes more open every day, which enriches the pool of ideas that people bring to it from different backgrounds.</p><p>This book is an introduction to practical game design using Unity and Playmaker by Hutong Games. The latter lets anyone make a game without writing any programming code, while not giving up any of the power that Unity has to offer. Knowing the basics of programming is still valuable while working on the technical side of a game, but going deep into it is no longer an imperative, which means that creating a game is now easier than it has ever been before.</p><p>Even if you know how to code, learning how to use Playmaker in Unity may help you see the synergy between your game's mechanics and technology more clearly, making the development of your project more about finding the right design and less about working around the computer code.</p><p>There can be no doubt about the bright future of the practical aspect of game design, and this book offers you to become part of this future.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with Unity and Playmaker</em>, gives us information about installing Unity, buying and installing Playmaker, creating and setting up the project, and making some adjustments to the interface layout.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Unity's and Playmaker's User Interface">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Unity's and Playmaker's User Interface</em>, gives an introduction to the essential interface elements of Unity and Playmaker: menus, panels, and views.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Components and State Machines">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Components and State Machines</em>, gives details about the project structure in Unity with and without Playmaker and introduces the component-based approach to game development.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Creating Your First Game">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Creating Your First Game</em>, gives information about applying and expanding your Unity and Playmaker skills learned in previous chapters to create real game mechanics.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Scripting and Custom Actions">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Scripting and Custom Actions</em>, gives an introduction to Unity scripting in JavaScript and C#, making a custom Playmaker action.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Networking and Multiplayer">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Networking and Multiplayer</em>, gives details about adding multiplayer to your game using the plugin called Photon Cloud.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Working with External APIs">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Working with External APIs</em>, gives information on working with external APIs, making your game available online on Kongregate, and integrating its online leaderboard.</p></div></div>
