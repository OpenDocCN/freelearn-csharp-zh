<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
<p>Software projects quickly go from greenfield paradises to brownfield wastelands filled with legacy code and technical debt. Every engineer will encounter projects that are more difficult than they should be due to existing technical debt. This book covers the process of refactoring existing code into more maintainable forms.</p>
<p>In Refactoring with C#, we focus on using modern C# and Visual Studio features to safely pay down technical debt in a sustainable way – while continuing to deliver value to the business.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for two distinct types of readers.</p>
<p>The first is junior and mid-level C# developers in the first few years of their careers. This book will teach you the programming techniques and mentalities needed to advance in your career. You’ll learn how to safely refactor your code and find new ways of improving the overall structure of your code.</p>
<p>The second type of reader is the software engineer or engineering manager dealing with a particularly troublesome codebase or a project or organization resistant to refactoring. This book will help you make the case for refactoring, ensure you can do it safely, and give you alternatives to all-or-nothing approaches of complete rewrites.</p>
<p>This book also features a number of libraries and language features you may not have encountered or thought about recently. I hope that this book gives you new perspectives, tools, and techniques that will aid you as you refactor your code and build a better codebase.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B21324_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Technical Debt, Code Smells, and Refactoring</em>, introduces the reader to the concept of technical debt and the things that cause it. The chapter covers legacy code and its impact on the development process and code smells that help you find it. The chapter closes with the idea of refactoring, which is the focus of the rest of the book.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Refactoring</em>, illustrates the process of refactoring C# code in Visual Studio by taking a sample piece of code and progressively refining it with built-in refactorings and custom actions.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor045"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Refactoring Code Flow and Iteration</em>, focuses on refactoring individual lines and blocks of code. We focus on program flow control, object instantiation, handling collections, and using LINQ appropriately.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Refactoring at the Method Level</em>, expands the scope of the previous chapter by refactoring methods and constructors to more maintainable forms. Maintaining consistency within the class and building small, maintainable methods is a core focus.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Object-Oriented Refactoring</em>, takes the ideas of the previous refactoring chapters and applies them at the entire class level. This shows how introducing interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and other classes in general can lead to better patterns of code and more maintainable software systems.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor133"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Unit Testing</em>, serves as an introduction to unit testing in C#, moving quickly from the idea of a unit test to a tour of how to write one in xUnit, NUnit, and MSTest. We also cover parameterized tests and unit testing best practices.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor161"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Test-Driven Development</em>, introduces the reader to test-driven development and red/green/refactor by following the TDD process to improve code and enact refactorings. Code generation quick actions are also discussed here.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Avoiding Code Anti-Patterns with SOLID</em>, focuses on what makes code good or bad and how common patterns such as SOLID, DRY, and KISS can help make your code more resistant to technical debt.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor189"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Advanced Unit Testing</em>, covers a variety of testing libraries for data generation, mocking, pinning existing behavior, and safely making changes with A/B tests. We cover Bogus, Fluent Assertions, Moq, NSubstitute, Scientist .NET, Shouldly, and Snapper.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor209"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Defensive Coding Techniques</em>, shows off a wide range of C# language features that can make your code more reliable and resistant to defects. This chapter covers nullability, validation, immutability, record classes, pattern matching, and more.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor236"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">AI-Assisted Refactoring with GitHub Copilot</em>, introduces the reader to the latest AI tooling in Visual Studio with GitHub Copilot Chat. This chapter shows the reader how to use GitHub Copilot Chat to generate code, give refactoring suggestions, write draft documentation, and even help test your code. We also stress on data privacy concerns and ways of guarding your company’s intellectual property.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor259"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Code Analysis in Visual Studio</em>, highlights the code analyzers built into modern .NET by showing how code analysis profiles can help detect issues in your code. We also explore code metrics and prioritize technical debt areas using those metrics. The chapter closes by looking at the SonarCloud and NDepend tools, which can help track technical debt over time.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor275"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating a Roslyn Analyzer</em>, introduces the idea of custom Roslyn Analyzers that can detect issues in your code. The chapter guides the reader through writing their first analyzer, unit testing it with RoslynTestKit, and deploying it using a Visual Studio extension.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor297"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Refactoring Code with Roslyn Analyzers</em>, shows how Roslyn Analyzers can also fix the issues they detect. The chapter picks up where the previous one left off by expanding the analyzer to provide a code fix. We then discuss packaging analyzers in NuGet packages and publishing them on NuGet.org or other NuGet feeds.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor316"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Communicating Technical Debt</em>, covers the systematic process of tracking and reporting technical debt in a way that business leaders can understand. We cover many common obstacles to refactoring and building a culture of trust and transparency where business management can understand the risks that technical debt represents.</p>
<p><a href="B21324_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor341"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">Adopting Code Standards</em>, talks about the process of determining code standards that are appropriate for your development team and getting developer buy-in. The chapter covers code styling in Visual Studio, code cleanup profiles, and sharing EditorConfig files to promote consistent style choices across your team.</p>

<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-15" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Part 1: Refactoring with C# in Visual Studio</h1>
<p>In the first part of the book, we’ll discuss the nature of technical debt, code smells, and refactoring. We’ll focus on the mechanical process of refactoring C# code in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Throughout this part, you’ll learn how to safely alter the form of your code without changing its functionality. We’ll cover high-level concepts and then walk through refactoring individual lines of code. After this, we’ll zoom out to refactor entire methods and see how they interact with each other. Finally, we’ll look at some object-oriented approaches to refactoring that can help truly reshape your code by altering how classes interact with each other.</p>
<p>This part of the book can either be read as a traditional book or used as a step-by-step tutorial for refactoring the starting code found in each chapter.</p>
<p>This part contains the following chapters:</p>
