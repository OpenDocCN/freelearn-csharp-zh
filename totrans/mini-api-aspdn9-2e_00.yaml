    and efficient web services with ASP.NET using minimal APIs.

- en: As the landscape of web development continues to evolve, there is a growing
    demand for simplicity, speed, and maintainability. I wrote this book to introduce
    developers—whether experienced or new to the ASP.NET ecosystem—to the power of
    minimal APIs, an approach that allows for the creation of lightweight and performance-oriented
    applications.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the release of .NET 6 in 2021, Microsoft introduced minimal APIs as a new
    way to define HTTP APIs with less ceremony and boilerplate code. Minimal APIs
    focus on reducing the overhead traditionally associated with larger frameworks
    such as ASP.NET MVC, while still maintaining the robustness of the .NET platform.
    By stripping away unnecessary complexity, minimal APIs empower developers to rapidly
    prototype, iterate, and deploy applications that scale with their needs.

- en: In this book, I will walk you through the essentials of minimal APIs, from basic
    routing and endpoint structure to advanced features such as dependency injection,
    authentication, and middleware integration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ll also introduce you to some core design principles, providing an overview
    of some best practices designed to keep your minimal APIs maintainable, secure,
    and scalable over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each chapter is structured to provide hands-on examples, ensuring that by the
    end, you’ll not only understand how to use minimal APIs but also why they matter
    in modern software development.

    (RC1), and .NET 9 was very close to general availability. I’ve included information
    throughout the book on new minimal API features in . NET 9.

    or a newcomer seeking to understand web development, this book will guide you
    step by step. It’s ideal for developers seeking to build microservices, start-ups
    prototyping new ideas, or even established enterprises looking for a more efficient
    way to handle specific API needs.
