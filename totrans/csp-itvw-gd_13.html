			<h2 id="_idParaDest-608" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor608" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Object-oriented programming</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">In this section, we delve into the core aspects of <em class="italic">classes</em> and <em class="italic">objects</em> in C#, exploring their declarations, lifecycle, and interactions, along with the concept of inheritance and related operators.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Classes</h3>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Declaration</strong>: Every class in C# is a blueprint for creating objects. The class declaration defines variables<a id="_idIndexMarker1169" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> for data storage and methods to <a id="_idIndexMarker1170" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>perform actions.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Constructors</strong>: Methods that are automatically called when an object is created. They are often <a id="_idIndexMarker1171" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>used for variable initialization.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Destructors</strong>: Although rarely used in C# due to the garbage collector, destructors serve to release unmanaged resources.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Objects</h3>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Creation</strong>: In C#, an object is<a id="_idIndexMarker1172" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> created using the <strong class="source-inline1">new</strong> keyword</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Interaction</strong>: Through a <a id="_idIndexMarker1173" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>class instance, you can interact with its members—methods, properties, and events</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Destruction</strong>: The garbage collector automatically removes objects that are no longer accessible</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Inheritance</strong>: Inheritance in C# enables the creation of new classes that derive properties and methods<a id="_idIndexMarker1174" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> from existing ones, fostering reusability and hierarchical organization in code</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Base and derived classes</strong>: Through inheritance, you can create a new class that inherits the members of an existing class, adding or modifying them</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="source-inline1">is</strong> and <strong class="source-inline1">as</strong> operators: They <a id="_idIndexMarker1175" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>allow safe type checking of objects and casting between them</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Polymorphism</h3>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Method overloading</strong>: Allows<a id="_idIndexMarker1176" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> having multiple methods in a class with the same name but a different set <a id="_idIndexMarker1177" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>of parameters</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Overriding</strong>: In <a id="_idIndexMarker1178" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>derived classes, you can change or extend the behavior of <a id="_idIndexMarker1179" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>base class methods using the <strong class="source-inline1">override</strong> keyword</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-609" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor609" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Advanced concepts</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">This section offers an insightful<a id="_idIndexMarker1180" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> exploration of advanced C# features such as lambda expressions, LINQ, delegates, anonymous methods, and events, each playing a pivotal role in efficient and expressive coding.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Lambda expressions</h3>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Syntax</strong>: Lambda expressions<a id="_idIndexMarker1181" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> use the <strong class="source-inline1">=&gt;</strong> symbol to define anonymous functions in a compact style.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Usage</strong>: Lambda expressions are particularly useful when working with collections or any other types that support delegates. These expressions are often used in LINQ queries.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Language Integrated Query (LINQ)</h3>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Queries to collections</strong>: Allows executing queries on various data sources without delving into the details <a id="_idIndexMarker1182" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>of their implementation.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Syntax</strong>: Includes both a query and a method-style syntax for writing queries</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Usage</strong>: With LINQ, you can filter, sort, group, and aggregate data from different sources</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Delegates</h3>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Declaration</strong>: Defines the type of method that can be represented by a delegate</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Usage</strong>: They allow the <a id="_idIndexMarker1183" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>creation of variables that can point to any method with a specific signature, regardless of which class these methods belong to</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Anonymous methods</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">A way to create a method “on the fly” without <a id="_idIndexMarker1184" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>the need to declare a separate method name.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Events</h3>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Declaration</strong>: A mechanism that allows an object to notify other objects that a certain event has occurred with it</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Subscription</strong>: When an <a id="_idIndexMarker1185" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>object is interested in an event, it “subscribes” to that event</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Invocation</strong>: The process of initiating an event by the object that generated it to notify subscribers about the event</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="calibre3">(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanya-rybina-059a43242/" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre">https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanya-rybina-059a43242/</a>)</p>
			<p class="author-quote">I would say that beginners should learn essentials to achieve understanding how their code really works. With a solid understanding of essentials, you can write good, reliable code. They should start from learning about things like data types in CLR, what is stack and heap, OOP principles, SOLID principles, how different constructions like using statement and foreach works and asynchronous state machines. Also, for me, looking how C# works under the hood when it is compiled to IL was very interesting and it helped me better understand how my code works. When you know essentials, you can start learning about ASP.NET, MAUI, and other frameworks that you want to learn.</p>

				<li class="calibre11">Oleksii, full-stack C# developer</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksii-sokol-44b963197/" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre">https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksii-sokol-44b963197/</a>)</p>
			<p class="author-quote">Everyone can share their successes, but who can share their failures? So I’ll start with the failures. C# covers a very large range of technologies and capabilities. My biggest mistake was that I grabbed every job opportunity regardless of the technology stack. Therefore, I advise you to choose a target area for development, and without being distracted by other sweet jobs, improve your highly specialized profile and go for interviews on it. It may seem like it will take a long time, but if you scatter your attention on the entire spectrum of C# opportunities, it will take even more time, and as a result, you will be left with nothing.</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">Yurii, C# developer<p class="author-quote">I do not believe there is a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Some may find it easier to immerse themselves in books and read, while others may be more productive by taking online courses and learning from them. In my opinion, the first and crucial step would be to find a community where you can discuss what you are learning and learn from others’ experiences. This significantly eases and accelerates progress. In addition, it is important not to forget that programming is a practical skill; you can only acquire it through hands-on practice.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">In exploring C# interview experiences, we learned key lessons. Tanya highlights mastering fundamentals, Oleksii advises <a id="_idIndexMarker1210" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>focusing on a specific C# area, and Yurii emphasizes community engagement and hands-on practice.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-615" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor615" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Technical preparation</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Technical preparation is a key element in every developer’s success. But with the vast amount of resources and information on the internet, how do you determine what’s truly valuable? These stories unveil how some successful developers approached their technical preparation and how they keep their skills up to date:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">Tanya:<p class="author-quote">I think you can determine which information is really good by the way it’s written and who the author is. For example, good articles almost always have detailed explanations that are easy to understand, code samples, and schemes. I always try to find information written by experienced developers. Also, reading official documentation can be useful, but sometimes it is not enough and you want to know more. This is when these articles could be helpful. Books are a valuable source of information, but reading them requires a lot of time. It could be a great thing to do in your spare time.</p></li>
				<li class="calibre11">Oleksii:<p class="author-quote">I would advise you to find an interesting field, but it should be a golden mean between something completely new and something from the dinosaur era. By studying old technologies, you run the risk that this technology will soon be out of support and you will have to learn a new one. Brand-new technologies may be unsustainable, and there will be very few job openings.</p></li>
				<li class="calibre11">Yurii:<p class="author-quote">In preparation, it’s important to understand your future role in the team and the specific technologies being used. Often, developers forget that the first call with HR is an opportunity to learn more about the project. Depending on the information gathered during communication, you can determine which technologies to highlight and where to focus less attention.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Tanya and Oleksii’s insights on technical preparation reveal two key strategies: Tanya advocates for learning<a id="_idIndexMarker1211" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> from experienced developers and diverse resources, while Oleksii suggests balancing between emerging and established technologies for a stable career path.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-616" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor616" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Soft skills and career growth</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Soft skills have become an integral part of every professional’s career, especially in the IT sector. While the emphasis used to be primarily on technical skills, today, understanding human psychology, effective communication, and teamwork are recognized as equally crucial:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">Tanya:<p class="author-quote">Soft skills are very important when it comes to teamwork. I think these are the kinds of skills you could achieve only while working in a team. For me, key elements of good teamwork are understanding each other, being able to solve problems quickly, and the ability to assign tasks correctly among the team.</p></li>
				<li class="calibre11">Oleksii:<p class="author-quote">I also had experience in finding people for the team. First of all, I pay attention to the person as a person. After all, I have to work with them, help them, and consult them on some issues. This person should be easy to communicate with, willing to learn, and able to accept criticism and their mistakes. However, technical knowledge and logical thinking are also important. You need to have a basic understanding of what you will be working with. And logical thinking will help you to easily join the work and master new knowledge.</p><p class="author-quote">I know from my own experience that this is very important now. I had a situation where I passed the interview perfectly, but the team leader was bored and was looking for the same employee. But this is a two-way situation. You also have to evaluate the team you are working with. For me personally, it’s not comfortable to work with bookworms, but for someone else it might be the other way around.</p></li>
				<li class="calibre11">Yurii:<p class="author-quote">In one of my previous offices, there was a large sheet with bold letters saying “99% of problems are communication”, and it’s true! You can write very good code adhering to all architectural patterns, all well-known development principles, code that impresses the Gang of Four, but if it doesn’t meet the client’s requirements, it’s worth nothing. That’s why it’s important to be able to listen to people, understand what they need, and be able to explain why they don’t need what they think they do.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">In discussing the role of soft skills in career growth, Tanya, Oleksii, and Yurii underscore their significance in IT. Tanya focuses on teamwork dynamics, Oleksii on personal attributes and logical thinking in team building, and Yurii on communication’s pivotal role in meeting client requirements.</p>
