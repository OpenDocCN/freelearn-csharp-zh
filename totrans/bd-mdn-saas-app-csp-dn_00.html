			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>I have been working on .NET applications virtually from the very beginning of .NET. I think that I have worked with every possible .NET tool over the years, frontend and backend, good and bad! This has memorably included delivering training tools for processing facilities, building remote monitoring tools, and developing optimization solutions – all <span class="No-Break">with .NET!</span></p>
			<p>In this book, I have tied together my experience from the many projects that I have worked on over the last 20 years to put together what I hope is an interesting and informative look at how to build modern <strong class="bold">software-as-a-service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) applications <span class="No-Break">with .NET.</span></p>
			<p>This book is designed to detail and demystify the world of building SaaS applications with .NET and the Microsoft tech stack and aims to deliver the technical knowledge required to build, test, deploy, and maintain a modern SaaS application. We start off by introducing the technology that we will use and showcase it with a demo application. As we move through the book, we add additional tools and techniques, building up to the point that we have described and demonstrated all of the major topics required to build a <span class="No-Break">SaaS application.</span></p>
			<p>In reading this book, you’ll learn the tools, techniques, and best practices required to develop modern SaaS applications that will impress your users and deliver value for your enterprise. We cover the full stack, from the database to the <strong class="bold">user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI</strong>), and then onward to deploying and maintaining the application <span class="No-Break">in production.</span></p>
			<p>I have tried to make this book accessible to everyone. To this end, I have exclusively used free and open source tools, and I have tried to always introduce new topics by linking them to core principles with as little assumed knowledge as possible. Where possible, I have illustrated the theory with <span class="No-Break">practical examples.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the theory required and will have explored much of it through practical examples. You should be well on your way to delivering your first real-world <span class="No-Break">SaaS application!</span></p>
			<p>It is my hope that you will find this book not only educational and informative but also enjoyable. I also very much hope that the learning that you take away from this book will help you in your career and in all of your <span class="No-Break">future endeavors!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is aimed at anyone who wants to build a SaaS application and is interested in using the Microsoft tech stack to build it! However, there is no shying away from the fact that SaaS development is a relatively advanced topic. It will stand you in good stead if you have a strong knowledge of C# and .NET. It will also be very useful to have a working knowledge of database and <span class="No-Break">web development.</span></p>
			<p>While this book covers advanced topics, do not be put off if you are still a beginner! In this book, even the more advanced topics are introduced and explained in an approachable way and generally underpinned with examples, such that there will be something to learn for everyone who wants to learn – regardless of <span class="No-Break">skill level!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B19343_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a><em class="italic">, The Modern Distribution Model </em><em class="italic">th</em><em class="italic">at We All Need</em>, gives a short history of SaaS and introduces the technologies that we will use in <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19343_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Building a Simple Demo Application</em>, dives into the technology that we will focus on in this book and builds a skeleton application that we can add to as we <span class="No-Break">go along.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19343_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a><em class="italic">, What Is Multi-Tenancy, and Why Is It Important in SaaS Applications?</em>, covers multi-tenancy, with a specific focus on SaaS applications. We add multi-tenancy to the example from <a href="B19343_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19343_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Building Databases and Planning for Data-Rich Applications</em>, focuses on the database, specifically building with SQL Server and <span class="No-Break">Entity Framework.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19343_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Building R</em><em class="italic">EST</em><em class="italic">ful APIs</em>, builds on what we have covered with the database layer by adding an API to make the data available over HTTP. As well as building the example application, this chapter delves into the theory behind <span class="No-Break">RESTful APIs.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19343_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor140"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Microservices for SaaS Applications</em>, looks at microservices and SaaS, which go hand in hand. This chapter covers the theory and practice of building a microservice application and applies some of the learnings to the <span class="No-Break">demo app.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19343_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor169"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Building a User Interface</em>, explains why the UI is a very important piece of the SaaS puzzle. This chapter covers the theory and adds a UI to the demo app <span class="No-Break">with Blazor.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19343_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor200"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Authentication and Authorization</em>, covers the complex topic of adding authentication and authorization to a SaaS app. Specific mention is made of the challenges involved in working with multi-tenant and <span class="No-Break">microservice applications.</span></p>

This chapter covers both topics and gives advice on which tools and techniques <span class="No-Break">to use.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19343_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor257"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a><em class="italic">,  Release Often, Release Early</em>, covers the process of building and releasing your application in a managed way using <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous deployment</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) pipelines.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19343_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor284"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Growing Pains – Operating at Scale</em>, discusses how as a SaaS application starts to grow and gain users, a whole new set of problems arise and must be faced by the development team.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>This book is intended to be as accessible as possible for anyone wanting to get into building SaaS applications. That said, SaaS is a complex and advanced topic, and so a good knowledge of the following <span class="No-Break">will help:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>.NET application development with C#</li>
				<li>SQL Server and Entity Framework</li>
				<li>General web development</li>
				<li>Some knowledge of Docker may be useful but is not required</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I hope, though, that anyone working in the software industry or still learning their craft can read this book and advance <span class="No-Break">their understanding!</span></p>
