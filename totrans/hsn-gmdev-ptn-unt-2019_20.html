<p class="mce-root">Unity might have a robust built-in component system, but it won't prevent you from having tight coupling issues in your code base. You want to make sure objects can communicate with each other without being bound together to the point that if one element is missing in the chain, everything breaks down. The patterns in this section are designed to help you decouple your dependencies and offer a way to write code that's more scalable.</p>
