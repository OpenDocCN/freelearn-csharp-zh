<p class="mce-root">In the last chapter, <span>we explored cameras and lighting. We started by looking at cameras, as well as the concepts of perspectives, frustums, and skyboxes. Next, we learned the possible uses of multiple cameras in Unity games. We also covered the different types of lighting, explored reflection probes, and concluded with a look at shadows.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">We are ready to start making our game environment more robust. We will do that by adding trees and other objects to our scene. In this chapter, we will create 3D objects using Unity's native modeling tools. We will also import and use assets from two sources. Our first source will be the Unity Asset Store where we will download free-to-use assets for our game. We will also import 3D assets prepared specifically for our <em>Cucumber Beetle</em> game. As we obtain the assets, we will incorporate them into the game project and watch our game start to take shape.</p>
<p>We will cover the following concepts in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding assets and GameObjects</li>
<li>Creating 3D objects in Unity</li>
<li>Using the Unity Asset Store</li>
<li>Incorporating custom assets in our game</li>
<li>Working with imported assets</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>If you want to use the same Unity project featured in this chapter, you can download the <kbd>Starting-Chapter-06.zip</kbd> file from the publisher's companion site. Once you download the file, decompress it, and then open the project in Unity. It contains the completed work from the previous chapters.</span></div>

<p>Assets are defined as useful or valuable things. In Unity, assets are things you will use in our game in conjunction with GameObjects. We'll discuss GameObjects later in this section. There are three basic categories of asset based on their source: Unity, user created, and third party. The Unity game engine comes with free assets and offers a library of premium (not free) assets. User-created assets are those that you create yourself. We will create our own assets later in this chapter. The final asset type is third party, meaning that someone other than you or Unity created it. </p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">When we select the <span class="ScreenTextPACKT"><span class="packt_screen">Assets</span></span> drop-down menu, as shown in the following screenshot, we have several options available to us. You will become familiar with the <span class="packt_screen">Create</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Import New Asset</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Import Package</span> options in this chapter:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="343" width="193" src="assets/3da45d6a-3a19-41da-b412-b6251c1908b6.png"/></div>
<p>Regardless of the asset source, Unity, user-created, and third-party, assets can be of several types. As you can see in the following screenshot, these asset types include scripts, scenes, prefabs, materials, animations and more:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="437" width="301" src="assets/1bcd289a-9c63-464d-911d-4b705f7feec3.png"/></div>

            <article>
                
<p class="NormalPACKT">Asset packages are bundles of assets grouped together. We can create packages to share our assets with others, or to save them for use in another game or Unity application. We can even create asset bundles to sell in Unity's Asset Store.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">To create an <kbd>asset</kbd> package, you simply select all the assets you want in the package using the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel. Then you have two options. Your first option is to right-click and select <span class="packt_screen">Export Package</span>. The second option is to select <span class="ScreenTextPACKT"><span class="packt_screen">Assets</span></span> | <span class="ScreenTextPACKT"><span class="packt_screen">Export Package</span> from the top menu</span>. Both options result in the same outcome.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">In addition to the ability to export packages from Unity, we can also import <kbd>asset</kbd> packages into our Unity games. To import an <kbd>asset</kbd> package, we simply select the <span class="ScreenTextPACKT"><span class="packt_screen">Assets | Import Package</span></span> menu option. That reveals the options shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="183" width="126" src="assets/eccc8f5d-79a8-4498-bc3c-e13ea792efc2.png"/></div>
<p class="NormalPACKT">When importing <kbd>asset</kbd> packages, we can select from one of the standard asset packages listed: <span class="packt_screen">2D</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Cameras</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Characters</span>, <span class="packt_screen">CrossPlatformInput</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Effects</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Environment</span>, <span class="packt_screen">ParticleSystems</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Prototyping</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Utility</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Vehicles</span>. We can also import a custom package from our computer's filesystem. </p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">When a package is selected, Unity will decompress the package and then display the package contents to you. We will perform this operation later in this chapter.</p>

<p>GameObjects are things we use in our game, such as 2D objects, 3D objects, audio, cameras, lights, user interfaces, and visual effects. GameObjects have properties, which vary based on their type, and components. Components can consist of things such as scripts, animations, and more. You will learn a lot about GameObjects and how to work with them as we continue to work on our game. </p>
<p>GameObjects are composed of components. As you can see in the following screenshot of the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel, our game's <span class="packt_screen">Main Camera</span> has four components: <span class="packt_screen">Transform</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Camera</span>, <span class="packt_screen">GUI Layer</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Flare Layer</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Audio Listener</span>: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="474" width="224" src="assets/4d6df247-701f-4a1f-af2e-7a84fed42f4a.png"/></div>
<p>At the bottom of the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel is the <span class="packt_screen">Add Component</span> button. That button gives us access to Unity's components using the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Mesh</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Effects</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Physics</span></li>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, GameObjects can include <span>3D objects with properties and components. In this section, we will create a 3D object to represent a blood droplet that we can use when the Cucumber Man is battling with a Cucumber Beetle. Before we create the object, let's create a material so that our blood droplet can have a realistic red color. </span>Follow these steps to create the material:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>In the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel, click</span> <span class="packt_screen">Materials</span>, <span>and then right-click in the folder and select</span> <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Material</span></li>
<li>Name the new material <span class="packt_screen">red</span></li>
<li>With the new material selected, click the color box in the <span class="packt_screen">Main Maps</span> section of the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel</li>
<li>In the color selector window that pops-up, select a red color and then close the selection box</li>
</ol>
<p>Your new material, when viewed in the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel, should look similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="340" width="317" src="assets/8c22f3e2-591c-45f1-b303-4248c94c17cc.png"/></div>
<p>Next, let's create the sphere:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the top menu, select <span class="packt_screen">GameObject</span> | <span class="packt_screen">3D Object</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Sphere</span>.</li>
<li>Use the transform tools to position the new sphere so that you can see it in the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view.</li>
<li>Use the <span class="packt_screen">Transform</span> section of the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel to increase the <span class="packt_screen">Scale</span> to <span class="packt_screen">5</span> for the <span class="packt_screen">X</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Y</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Z</span> <span class="packt_screen">Scale</span> parameters. This will help make the sphere larger and easier to work with.</li>
<li>Next, we will assign the red material to the sphere. With the sphere selected in the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel and the <kbd>Materials</kbd> folder selected in the project panel, drag the <span class="packt_screen">red</span> material from the <kbd>Materials</kbd> folder to the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel <span class="packt_screen">Mesh Renderer</span> component, in the <span class="packt_screen">Materials</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Element 0</span> parameter.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will now see that the sphere in the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view is red. </p>
<p>If we intend on using this sphere to simulate blood droplets, we might need several dozen of them. We will explore our options in the next section.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Using prefabs</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In the previous section, you created a sphere to simulate a blood droplet. You also created a red material and applied it to your sphere. In the game, we might want to simulate a great battle and have multiple blood droplets visible at once. In Unity, we can make as many copies of our master as we want. For example, let's assume we have 100 spheres, all copied from our master. What happens when we want to alter them, perhaps changing the size or material? It would be a laborious task to edit each one. </p>
<p>An alternative is to use a prefab. In Unity, a prefab is an asset type that serves as a shell for a GameObject along with properties and components. The sphere we created is a GameObject, and, as you can see in the following screenshot, our sphere has several components and properties: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="430" width="271" src="assets/d8bb87cf-5f49-4705-8666-de1265ee8210.png"/></div>
<p>So, let's create a prefab to hold our sphere. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel, select the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder.</li>
<li>Right-click on the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder and select <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Prefab</span>. Alternatively, you could have selected, from the top menu, <span class="packt_screen">Assets</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Prefab</span>.</li>
<li>Name the prefab <kbd>bloodDroplet</kbd>. You will notice that there are no components or properties visible in the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel for the new prefab.</li>
<li>Next, drag the <kbd>Sphere</kbd> GameObject from the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel to the new <kbd>bloodDroplet</kbd> prefab in the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel. Now, when you view the prefab in the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel, you can see the components and properties that our sphere had.</li>
<li>We no longer need the original sphere, so delete that in the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have a <kbd>bloodDroplet</kbd> prefab, we can drag it into our scene as many times as we want. We can also add them to our scene using scripts. </p>
<p>To experience the power of prefabs in Unity, try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <kbd>bloodDroplet</kbd> prefab in the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel.</li>
<li>Drag several copies of the <kbd>bloodDroplet</kbd> prefab into your scene.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel, change the color. You will notice that all the <kbd>bloodDroplets</kbd> in your scene were changed based on the change you made to the prefab.</li>
<li>Return the color of the prefab to the red material.</li>
<li>Delete any <kbd>bloodDroplets</kbd> from your scene. This is most easily done in the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">Deleting the <kbd>bloodDroplets</kbd> from your scene does not remove all <kbd>bloodDroplets</kbd> from your game. Because we have the <kbd>bloodDroplet</kbd> prefab, we can add <kbd>bloodDroplets</kbd> to our scene at any time. </div>

<p>In the previous section, you created a sphere. Unity also allows us to natively create other 3D objects: cubes, capsules, cylinders, planes, quads, rag dolls, terrain, trees, wind zones, and 3D text. The basic shapes—cube, sphere, capsule, cylinder, plane, and quad—<span>may not be what you need for your game, and we certainly do not need them for our <em>Cucumber Beetle</em> game. These 3D objects are great for testing components and scripts in Unity projects. We can delete them even more easily than we can create them, so they make great and expendable testing assets. We can use them in our games to experiment with before we spend any time on final graphics.</span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Unity operates a store called the Unity Asset Store. There are a great number of assets available to Unity developers. The store is accessible directly on the web at <a href="http://assetstore.unity3d.com">http://assetstore.unity3d.com</a>. You can also open a window within Unity to display the Asset Store. This is done by selecting <span class="packt_screen">Window</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Asset Store</span>.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you connect to the Unity Asset Store, you will see a hierarchical category listing in the top-right-hand corner of the store. As you can see in the following screenshot, there are eleven asset categories:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="236" width="173" src="assets/cc557571-5952-4ac8-9aee-0cf39a31fa2f.png"/></div>
<p>Clicking on the triangular icons to the left of each category reveals subcategories. Some categories have multiple subcategories, which helps you find what you are looking for quickly. You can also use the Asset Store's search functionality.</p>
<p>When you click on a category, its contents will be viewable. Clicking on a specific asset will display several characteristics of that asset. These characteristics include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Publisher</li>
<li>Rating</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Add to Cart</span> button, or, in the case of free assets, a <span class="packt_screen">Download</span> button</li>
<li>Version of Unity required</li>
<li>Release date</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Package contents</li>
<li>File size</li>
<li>Version number (of the asset)</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Videos (not always available)</li>
<li>Link to publisher's website</li>
<li>User reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of things to consider regarding obtaining assets from the Unity Asset Store. First, you will want to make sure you have the requisite rights to use the asset as you plan to. For example, if you do not have commercial use rights, you will not want to use that particular asset in your commercial game.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider before selecting assets from the Asset Store is how large the files are. Fortunately, this information is part of the metadata displayed when you preview an asset.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will visit the Unity Asset Store, select an asset, and add that asset to our game project.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>In this section, we will go through the necessary steps to acquire assets from the Unity Asset Store. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the top menu, select <span class="packt_screen">Window</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Asset Store</span><span>.</span></li>
<li>In the search box, enter <kbd>Unity Particle Pack</kbd> and hit your keyboard's return button.</li>
<li>In the results, find the <span class="packt_screen">Unity Particle Pack</span> item by Unity Technologies. It will be a free asset package. Select that package by clicking on the title.</li>
<li>With the <span class="packt_screen">Unity Particle Pack</span> displayed in the Asset Store, click the <span class="packt_screen">Download</span> button.</li>
<li>You will be prompted to accept the <span class="packt_screen">License Agreement</span>. Click the <span class="packt_screen">Accept</span> button if you agree with the terms. This will start the download process.</li>
<li>When the download completes, the <span class="packt_screen">Import</span> button will appear. Click that button.</li>
<li>You will now see the <span class="packt_screen">Import Unity Package</span> dialog window. By default, all assets in the package will be selected. Click the <span class="packt_screen">Import</span> button at the bottom of the interface. The import progress will be displayed in a pop-up window and will automatically close when the process completes.</li>
<li>When the import process completes, close the Asset Store by right-clicking the tab and selecting <span class="packt_screen">Close</span> tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see from the following screenshot, there will be a new <kbd>EffectExamples</kbd> folder under <span class="packt_screen">Assets</span> in your <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="142" width="151" src="assets/f363dec4-f8f6-4c8b-a816-d89335b35245.png"/></div>
<p>We now have a nice set of special effects we can use in our game. We will incorporate some of them in <a href="f7abb907-5397-4668-972e-e69acb441421.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Adding Audio and Visual Effects to Our Game</em>. </p>

<p>So far in this chapter, we have created our own game asset and downloaded an asset package from the Unity Asset Store. In this section, we will download assets from the publisher's companion website for use in our game.</p>
<p>Go through the following steps to obtain the asset packages that were created specifically for our <em>Cucumber Beetle</em> game:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the publisher's website and download the following files:
<ul>
<li><kbd>CherriesAndTree.unitypackage</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>CucumberAndPatches.unitypackage</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From the top menu, select <span class="packt_screen">Assets</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Import Package</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Custom Package</span> and navigate to the <kbd>CherriesAndTree.unitypackage</kbd> file. Click the <span class="packt_screen">Open</span> button.</li>
<li>As shown in the following screenshot, the <span class="packt_screen">Import Unity Package</span> dialog window will have the necessary files for our Cherry Tree and the cherries. Click the <span class="packt_screen">Import</span> button:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="320" width="306" src="assets/598ca92f-db91-498e-8297-9da676720360.png"/></div>
<p>Next, we will import the cucumber and two Cucumber Patches. These are contained in the <kbd>CucumberAndPatches.unitypackage</kbd> asset package. Follow the preceding steps to import this asset package into your game.</p>
<p>As you can see in the following screenshot, there are several files in this asset package relating to the cucumber and both Cucumber Patches: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="444" width="287" src="assets/8cf23172-31dd-40ed-bb3b-58f58fa6cbb5.png"/></div>

<p>In the previous section, you added the following listed assets to your game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cherry</li>
<li>Cherry Tree</li>
<li>Cucumber</li>
<li>Cucumber Patches</li>
</ul>
<p><span>We will incorporate the cherry and cucumber assets in <a href="fdacd7a8-63fe-454d-9d50-f9f40070e484.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Scripting Our Points System</em>. In this section, we will plant our Cherry Trees and Cucumber Patches.</span></p>
<p><span>As you will recall from <a href="df7798e1-3730-4af7-8c04-857d71ac78d2.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Designing the Game</em>, we created spawn points in four corners and the center of our game environment. We also selected four areas in which to plant our Cherry Trees. Now that we have actual terrain, we can be more specific with our design. Look at the following diagram to determine where to plant our Cherry Trees and Cucumber Patches:</span></p>

<p>We will refer to this diagram in the next two sections as we plant our Cherry Trees and Cucumber Patches.</p>

<p>In <a href="f9370800-eaf9-4593-8a9c-8252c85e22ac.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Creating Our Terrain</em>, we created a tree to demonstrate how to create one from scratch. Since we downloaded a Cherry Tree in the last section, we no longer need our experimental tree. In the hierarchy panel, delete the three we previously created. Next, delete any tree assets and tree-related texture folders in the project panel. This will help us stay organized and minimize the size of our Unity game project.</p>
<p>Basic trees in Unity can be painted on a terrain. To accomplish this, you start by orienting the scene view <span>so that you have a top-down view of your terrain. Then, i</span><span>n the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel, select your terrain. You then use the</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Place Trees</span> <span>button in the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Terrain</span> <span>component of the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel to paint the trees on your terrain.</span></p>
<p>Because our Cherry Trees are special and contain multiple meshes, we cannot use the terrain painting tool. Instead, we will make multiple copies of our Cherry Tree prefab and place them where we want them to be in our game world using the previously provided diagram as a reference.</p>
<p>We have a few preparatory steps to take prior to planting our Cherry Trees. Follow these steps to prepare the prefab:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel, right-click on the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder and select <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Prefab</span>. Name the prefab <kbd>CherryTreeCollider</kbd>.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel, drag the <kbd>CherryTree.prefab</kbd> that you imported in the previous section into the <span class="packt_screen">S<span>cene</span></span> <span>view. It doesn't matter where.</span></li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel, select the Cherry Tree you just added to the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel, click the <span class="packt_screen">Is Trigger</span> checkbox in the <span class="packt_screen">Box Collider</span> component.</li>
<li><span>Still in the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel, click the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Add Component</span> <span>button and then select</span> <span class="packt_screen">Physics</span> <span>|</span> <span class="packt_screen">Box Collider</span><span>. We will use this collider to help us determine when the Cucumber Man is collecting cherries from a Cherry Tree.</span></li>
<li>Next, we will edit the collider to ensure it encapsulates the entire tree. In the <span class="packt_screen">Box Collider</span> area of the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel, click the <span class="packt_screen">Edit Collider</span> button.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see from the following screenshot, the collider is at the base of the <kbd>Cherry Tree</kbd> prefab:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="260" width="376" src="assets/ee68b387-d63b-4c75-8067-d5e78fbebbf2.png"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Using the the squares of the box collider in the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view, enlarge the collider so that it encompasses the majority of the Cherry Tree. It does not need to include the tree trunk. An example configuration is shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="218" width="383" src="assets/a13305e1-e734-4f67-a43b-aaa6f2b98b40.png"/></div>
<ol start="8">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel, ensure that the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder is selected.</li>
<li>Drag the Cherry Tree from the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel to the <kbd>CherryTreeCollider</kbd> prefab in the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder. This establishes a <kbd>Cherry Tree</kbd> prefab with a box collider.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel, delete the Cherry Tree, unless it is in a place that you want it to be in.</li>
<li>Select the <kbd>CherryTreeCollider</kbd> prefab in the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder. </li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel, click the pull-down menu next to <span class="packt_screen">Tag</span>. Select the <span class="packt_screen">Add Tag</span> button.</li>
<li>As indicated by the arrow in the following screenshot, click the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> icon at the bottom of the empty list:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="167" width="253" src="assets/6fb37a09-0ed0-4cf4-9dbf-39e0951b87ca.png"/></div>
<ol start="14">
<li>In the pop-up window, enter <kbd>CherryTree</kbd> as the tag name and click the <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> button.</li>
<li>Select the <kbd>CherryTreeCollider</kbd> prefab in the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder. </li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> panel, click the pull-down menu next to <span class="packt_screen">Tag</span>. Select the <kbd>CherryTree</kbd> tag.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you are ready to start planting your Cherry Trees. Simply drag the prefab to each area where you want a Cherry Tree. You can create as many or as few as you want. The example provided with this book contains 25 Cherry Trees.</p>
<p>Once your Cherry Trees are where you want them, your hierarchy panel will probably be disorganized. A quick trick to make things more organized is to right-click inside the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel and select <span class="packt_screen">Create Empty</span>. Then, rename the GameObject to <kbd>Cherry Trees</kbd>. Lastly, in the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel, select all the Cherry Trees and place them in that GameObject. Now that GameObject serves as a folder for viewing purposes. You can collapse and expand the folder as needed.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">If you placed your Cherry Trees using a top-down view in the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view, some of your trees might need to be raised or lowered based on your terrain. You can double-click a Cherry Tree in the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> view to auto-zoom in on the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view. </div>
<p>Once you complete your work on the Cherry Trees, save your scene and your project. </p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>We previously identified six areas for our Cucumber Patches. We can follow the same approach in placing Cucumber Patches in our game environment as we used for our Cherry Trees. If we took an auto-planting approach to planting our Cucumber Patches, we would likely end up with a lot more Cucumber Patches than we want. So, we will take a manual approach.</p>
<p>We have prefabs in the <kbd>Cucumber Patch</kbd> folder from our early import. Let's do a few things to prepare these prefabs for our use. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel, right-click in the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder and select <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Prefab</span>. Name the prefab <kbd>CucumberPatch1</kbd>.</li>
<li>Repeat step 1 and name this second prefab <kbd>CucumberPatch2</kbd>.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel, drag the <kbd>Patch1prefab</kbd> that you imported in the previous section into the <span class="packt_screen">S<span>cene</span></span> <span>view. It doesn't matter where.</span></li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel, select the Cucumber Patch you just added to the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel, ensure that the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder is selected.</li>
<li>Drag the Cucumber Patch from the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel to the <kbd>CucumberPatch1</kbd> prefab in the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder. </li>
<li>Delete the Cucumber Patch from the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel, drag the <kbd>Patch2prefab</kbd> that you imported in the previous section into the <span class="packt_screen">S<span>cene</span></span> <span>view. It doesn't matter where.</span></li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel, select the Cucumber Patch you just added to the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel, ensure that the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder is selected.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Drag the Cucumber Patch from the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> view to the <kbd>CucumberPatch2</kbd> prefab in the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder. </li>
<li>Delete the Cucumber Patch from the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel.</li>
</ol>
<p>We could have just moved the prefabs we imported to the <kbd>Prefabs</kbd> folder. Our approach was to duplicate them so that we have the originals available should we need them.</p>
<p>Next, we will prepare the six areas in our game world for the Cucumber Patches. Our goal is to identify the rectangular areas, each with a flat area of ground. </p>
<p>Using the following reference image and the Unity skills you used to create your terrain, we need to flatten the six areas and record their rectangle boundaries:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="421" width="344" src="assets/938896a2-8310-4ed9-9e2f-8a9774d0d954.png"/></div>
<p>To prepare our Cucumber Patch areas, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <span class="packt_screen">Paint Height</span> tool to flatten a Cucumber Patch area.</li>
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">GameObject</span> | <span class="packt_screen">3D Object</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Plane</span> from the top menu.</li>
<li>Position the plane so that it is on the ground, specifically in the flattened area.</li>
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> view, set the <span class="packt_screen">Materials</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Element 0</span> parameter to <span class="packt_screen">SpatialMappingOcclusion</span>. This will make the plane transparent.</li>
<li>Once the plane is in place, make note of the transform information.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 through 5 for the remaining Cucumber Patches.</li>
<li>Rename the planes so that you have <kbd>CucumberPatchArea1</kbd>, <kbd>CucumberPatchArea2</kbd>, <kbd>CucumberPatchArea3</kbd>, <kbd>CucumberPatchArea4</kbd>, <kbd>CucumberPatchArea5</kbd>, and <kbd>CucumberPatchArea6</kbd><span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>When you are completed, you should have six defined areas for your Cucumber Patches. For reference, the six areas used in the book's example are shown in the following table:</p>

<p><span>Our last step is to group the six Cucumber Patches in the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel to help stay organized. As we did with the Cherry Trees, we will right-click inside the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel and select <span class="packt_screen">Create Empty</span>. Then rename the GameObject as <kbd>Cucumber Patch Areas</kbd>. Lastly, in the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> panel, select all six Cucumber Patch panes and place them in that GameObject. </span></p>

<p>In this chapter, we spent considerable time making our game environment more robust. We imported and used several assets. We added trees and other objects to our scene. We created 3D objects using Unity's native modeling tools and imported assets from the Unity Asset Store, as well as from the publisher's companion site. Specifically, we added our game's Cherry Trees, and prepared areas for Cucumber Patches. </p>

We will import the character, review the controls, examine the animations, and make the necessary configuration changes to fully use our character in the game. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to start testing the game.</p>
