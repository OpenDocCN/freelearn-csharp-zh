			<h1 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor398"/>Currying and Partial Application</h1>
			<p>Congratulations! You have already covered more than 90% of the book! You are awesome and I’m giving you a virtual high-five! In this chapter, we will talk about currying and partial application. I know there is a special keyword, <strong class="source-inline">partial</strong>, that allows us to split our class, struct, or interface into parts; however, in functional programming, partial application has a different meaning. Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This transformation allows for incremental application of arguments, where each step returns a new function awaiting the next input. Partial application, on the other hand, involves fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing a function with fewer arguments. Both techniques are helpful in scenarios where not all arguments to a function are available at the same point in execution, thereby providing the flexibility to apply these arguments as they <span class="No-Break">become available.</span></p>
			<p>To learn these new techniques, we will go through the <span class="No-Break">following sections:</span></p>

			<p>Before moving on, I can’t leave you without regular self-check tasks to measure your knowledge before and after reading <span class="No-Break">the chapter.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor399"/>Task 1 – Currying tower attack functions</h1>
			<p>Refactor the <strong class="source-inline">AttackEnemy</strong> function<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> using currying, allowing the <strong class="source-inline">towerType</strong> to be preset for multiple uses throughout the game while accepting dynamic inputs for <strong class="source-inline">enemyId</strong> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">damage</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public void AttackEnemy(TowerTypes towerType, int enemyId, int damage)
{
   Console.WriteLine($"Tower {towerType} attacks enemy {enemyId} for {damage} damage.");
}</pre>			<h1 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor400"/>Task 2 – Partial application for game settings</h1>
			<p>Apply partial application<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> to create a function for <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>quick setup of standard game settings where the <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> is predefined but allows for dynamic setting of <strong class="source-inline">difficultyLevel</strong> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">isMultiplayer</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public void SetGameSettings(string map, int difficultyLevel, bool isMultiplayer)
{
   Console.WriteLine($"Setting game on map {map} with difficulty {difficultyLevel}, multiplayer: {isMultiplayer}");
}</pre>			<h1 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor401"/>Task 3 – Currying permission checks for game features</h1>
			<p>Curry this<a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> function so that it can first<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> accept a <strong class="source-inline">userRole</strong> and then return another function that takes a <strong class="source-inline">feature</strong>, determining whether the specified role has access <span class="No-Break">to it:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public bool CheckGameFeatureAccess(UserRoles userRole, GameFeatures feature)
{
    return _gameFeatureManager.HasAccess(userRole, feature);
}</pre>			<p>You might think these methods are already optimal, but their simplicity is intentional. These focused tasks let you practice functional programming without distractions. As always, these tasks are just for your self-assessment, and you’re not supposed to solve them easily. So, don’t worry if you have any difficulties with them, and just proceed with reading the chapter. By its end, you’ll tackle these challenges like a pro. Keep that in mind, and I hope<a id="_idIndexMarker535"/> you<a id="_idIndexMarker536"/> have a happy <span class="No-Break">coding experience!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor402"/>Understanding currying</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Currying</strong> is a technique<a id="_idIndexMarker537"/> that converts a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each accepting a single argument. Named after the mathematician Haskell Curry, currying enables the partial application of arguments, where each supplied argument returns a new function poised for the next input. This approach is helpful when we want to reuse parts of the function in different scenarios or make some calculations between steps in a <span class="No-Break">multi-step function.</span></p>
			<p>Before diving into the concepts, let’s catch up with Steve <span class="No-Break">and Julia.</span></p>
			<p>Julia: <em class="italic">Hey Steve, I see you’ve made great progress with functional programming. Today, we’ll explore currying and partial application, two powerful techniques that can help you write even more reusable and </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">modular code.</em></span></p>
			<p>Steve: <em class="italic">Hi Julia! That sounds interesting. I’ve heard about these concepts but never really understood how to apply them in C#. Can you break it down </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">for me?</em></span></p>
			<p>Julia: <em class="italic">Absolutely! Let’s start with currying. Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This transformation allows for the incremental application of arguments, where each step returns a new function awaiting the </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">next input.</em></span></p>
			<p>Steve: <em class="italic">So, it’s like creating a chain of functions, each taking </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">one argument?</em></span></p>
			<p>Julia: <em class="italic">Exactly! Let me show you a currying application in a practical example within a YouTube video management system. Often, we need to check whether a user has the appropriate permissions for different actions, such as viewing, commenting, and </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">uploading videos.</em></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor403"/>Standard approach</h2>
			<p>Typically, we<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> might use a function such as this to <span class="No-Break">check permissions:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public static bool CheckPermission(Actions action, UserRoles userRole)
{
     // Assume a method that checks a database or cache for permissions
     return _permissionsManager.HasPermission(action, userRole);
}</pre>			<p>This function is effective but requires both parameters each time you check a different action for the <span class="No-Break">same role.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-306"><a id="_idTextAnchor404"/>Curried approach</h2>
			<p>By currying this <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>function, we create a more adaptable permission checker, useful when handling multiple actions for the same user role during a session or in <span class="No-Break">similar contexts:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public static Func&lt;Actions, Func&lt;UserRoles, bool&gt;&gt; CurryCheckPermission()
{
   return action =&gt; userRole =&gt;
   {
      return _permissionsManager.HasPermission(action, userRole);
   };
}</pre>			<p>Use the curried approach <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var curriedPermissionChecker = CurryCheckPermission();
var checkViewerPermissions = curriedPermissionChecker(Actions.View);
var checkCommentPermissions = curriedPermissionChecker(Actions.Comment);
var checkUploadPermissions = curriedPermissionChecker(Actions.Upload);
bool canView = checkViewerPermissions(UserRoles.Admin);
bool canComment = checkCommentPermissions(UserRoles.Admin);
bool canUpload = checkUploadPermissions(UserRoles.Admin);</pre>			<p>As you can see in<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> this example, currying has <span class="No-Break">several benefits:</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reusability</strong>: The curried function <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>allows you to predefine the action and create specific functions for checking each role. This is especially beneficial when multiple roles need to be checked for the same action repeatedly during <span class="No-Break">a session.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reduction in redundant code</strong>: Currying separates the action from the role evaluation, reducing repetitive code when performing multiple checks for different roles under the same action. This improves code readability <span class="No-Break">and maintainability.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Convenience of partial application</strong>: You can partially apply the action when you know that all subsequent checks will be for that action, which is common in scenarios where a session or particular interface segment is focused on a single type <span class="No-Break">of action.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-307"><a id="_idTextAnchor405"/>Step-by-step implementation of currying</h1>
			<p>As Julia finished <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/>explaining the currying example, Steve <span class="No-Break">nodded thoughtfully.</span></p>
			<p>Steve: <em class="italic">I think I’m starting to get it. But how do we actually implement currying in </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">our code?</em></span></p>
			<p>Julia: <em class="italic">Great question! Let’s break it </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">down step-by-step...</em></span></p>
			<p>A process for implementing currying is actually <span class="No-Break">quite easy:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Identify <span class="No-Break">the function</span><span class="No-Break">:</span><p class="list-inset">Select a function that takes multiple parameters. This function is a candidate for currying if you often find yourself using only some of the parameters at a time or if the parameters are naturally grouped <span class="No-Break">in stages.</span></p></li>
				<li>Define <span class="No-Break">curried functions</span><span class="No-Break">:</span><p class="list-inset">Transform the multi-parameter function into a sequence of nested, single-parameter functions. Each function returns another function that expects the next parameter in <span class="No-Break">the sequence.</span></p></li>
				<li>Implement using <span class="No-Break">Func delegates</span><span class="No-Break">:</span><p class="list-inset">We can utilize <strong class="source-inline">Func</strong> delegates to implement curried functions. Each Func returns another Func until all parameters are accounted for, culminating in the return of the <span class="No-Break">final value.</span></p></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Simplify invocation</span><span class="No-Break">:</span><p class="list-inset">Although currying adds a level of indirection to function invocation, it simplifies the process by breaking it down into manageable steps, each of which can be handled separately <span class="No-Break">as needed.</span></p></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-308"><a id="_idTextAnchor406"/>Use cases</h2>
			<p>Although currying might<a id="_idIndexMarker543"/> look a bit cumbersome, it has many situations where it is beneficial. Let’s explore some common use cases and see how currying can be applied to improve code modularity <span class="No-Break">and reusability.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-309"><a id="_idTextAnchor407"/>Configuration settings</h2>
			<p>When setting up<a id="_idIndexMarker544"/> configurations that involve multiple parameters, currying allows these settings to be specified incrementally throughout the application. Consider an example where we need to set up a notification service limiting the maximum number of notifications sent per minute for each <span class="No-Break">user group:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public static Func&lt;NotificationType, Func&lt;int, Action&lt;string&gt;&gt;&gt; CurryNotificationConfig()
{
     return notificationType =&gt; maxNotificationsPerMinute =&gt; recipientEmail =&gt;
     {
         Console.WriteLine($"Configuring {notificationType} notification for {recipientEmail} with max {maxNotificationsPerMinute} notifications per minute");
     };
}
// Usage
var configureNotifications = CurryNotificationConfig();
var configureEmailNotifications = configureNotifications(NotificationType.Email);
// Configure users to receive a maximum of 10 notifications per minute
var configureUserNotifications = configureEmailNotifications(10);
configureUserNotifications("alice@csharp-interview-preparation.com");
configureUserNotifications("bob@csharp-interview-preparation.com");
// Configure moderators to receive more notifications
var configureModeratorNotifications = configureEmailNotifications(50);
configureModeratorNotifications("moderator1@csharp-interview-preparation.com");
configureModeratorNotifications("moderator2@csharp-interview-preparation.com");
configureModeratorNotifications("moderator3@csharp-interview-preparation.com");
// Configure admins to receive even more notifications
var configureAdminNotifications = configureEmailNotifications(100);
configureAdminNotifications("admin1@csharp-interview-preparation.com");
configureAdminNotifications("admin2@csharp-interview-preparation.com");</pre>			<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker545"/> example, the <strong class="source-inline">CurryNotificationConfig</strong> function accepts the notification type, maximum notifications per minute, and recipient email as curried parameters. Each group of users has its own settings, making the configuration for each specific user <span class="No-Break">more reusable.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-310"><a id="_idTextAnchor408"/>Event handling</h2>
			<p>In event-driven<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> programming, currying can be used to handle events with specific pre-filled parameters, simplifying event handler logic. Let’s consider an example of handling button <span class="No-Break">click events:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public static Func&lt;string, Func&lt;EventArgs, void&gt;&gt; CurryButtonClickHandler()
{
     return buttonName =&gt; eventArgs =&gt;
     {
         Console.WriteLine($"Button {buttonName} clicked!");
         // Handle the button click event
     };
}
// Usage
var handleButtonClick = CurryButtonClickHandler();
var handleSaveClick = handleButtonClick("Save");
var handleCancelClick = handleButtonClick("Cancel");
// Attach event handlers
saveButton.Click += (sender, e) =&gt; handleSaveClick(e);
cancelButton.Click += (sender, e) =&gt; handleCancelClick(e);</pre>			<p>By currying the button click handler, you can create specialized functions for each button (<strong class="source-inline">handleSaveClick</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">handleCancelClick</strong>) with the button name pre-filled. This simplifies the event handler attachment and makes the code more readable <span class="No-Break">and maintainable.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-311"><a id="_idTextAnchor409"/>Partial application</h2>
			<p>Currying facilitates <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>partial application, where a function with many parameters can be transformed into a function with fewer parameters by fixing some parameter values ahead of time. We will discuss it in detail in the next section, but for now, let’s look at an example of a <span class="No-Break">logging function:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public static Func&lt;string, Func&lt;string, void&gt;&gt; CurryLogMessage()
{
     return logLevel =&gt; message =&gt;
     {
         Console.WriteLine($"{logLevel}: {message}");
         // Log the message with the specified log level
     };
}
// Usage
var logMessage = CurryLogMessage();
var logError = logMessage("ERROR");
var logWarning = logMessage("WARNING");
logError("An error occurred.");
logWarning("This is a warning message.");</pre>			<p>In this case, currying allows you to partially apply the <strong class="source-inline">logLevel</strong> parameter, creating <strong class="source-inline">logError</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">logWarning</strong> functions for different log levels. This reduces the need to pass the log level repeatedly and makes the logging calls more concise <span class="No-Break">and expressive.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-312"><a id="_idTextAnchor410"/>Asynchronous programming</h2>
			<p>Currying can simplify <a id="_idIndexMarker548"/>asynchronous code by separating the preparation of parameters from the execution of asynchronous operations. Here is an example of making an <span class="No-Break">HTTP request:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public static Func&lt;string, Func&lt;Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;, Func&lt;CancellationToken, Task&lt;string&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CurryHttpGetRequest()
{
     return url =&gt; headers =&gt; async cancellationToken =&gt;
     {
         using (var client = new HttpClient())
         {
             foreach (var header in headers)
             {
                 client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(header.Key, header.Value);
             }
             return await client.GetStringAsync(url, cancellationToken);
         }
     };
}
// Usage
var getRequest = CurryHttpGetRequest();
var getWithUrl = getRequest("https://api.example.com/data");
var getWithHeaders = getWithUrl(new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;
{
     { "Authorization", "Bearer token123" },
     { "Content-Type", "application/json" }
});
string response = await getWithHeaders(CancellationToken.None);</pre>			<p>By currying the HTTP <strong class="source-inline">GET</strong> request function, we can separate the configuration of the URL, headers, and cancellation token. This allows for more flexible and modular asynchronous code, where each request aspect can be prepared independently and combined <span class="No-Break">when needed.</span></p>
			<p>In general, currying<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> aims to reduce redundancy and simplify the function’s usage across different parts of <span class="No-Break">the application.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-313"><a id="_idTextAnchor411"/>Partial application</h1>
			<p>In simple terms, partial<a id="_idIndexMarker550"/> application involves taking a function that accepts several arguments, supplying some of these arguments, and returning a new function that only requires the remaining arguments. This is very similar to what <span class="No-Break">currying does.</span></p>
			<p>Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each accepting a single argument. This enables partial application naturally, as each function returned by a curried function can be considered a partially <span class="No-Break">applied function.</span></p>
			<p>The key difference between currying and partial application lies in their implementation <span class="No-Break">and usage:</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Currying</strong> is about transforming <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>the function structure itself, turning a multi-argument function into a chain of <span class="No-Break">single-argument functions</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Partial application</strong>, on<a id="_idIndexMarker552"/> the other hand, does not necessarily change the function structure but reduces the number of arguments it needs by pre-filling some <span class="No-Break">of them</span></p>
			<p>Partial application can be particularly useful in scenarios involving configurations, repetitive tasks, and predefined conditions. It simplifies the interface for the end user of the function and can make the code base easier to maintain by encapsulating common parameters within partially <span class="No-Break">applied functions.</span></p>
			<p>Steve scratched his head, looking a <span class="No-Break">bit confused.</span></p>
			<p>Steve: <em class="italic">Julia, I’m having trouble seeing the difference between currying and partial application. They seem </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">really similar</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Julia: <em class="italic">You’re</em><em class="italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker553"/></em><em class="italic"> right that they’re related, Steve. The key difference is in how they’re implemented and used. Let me </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">explain further...</em></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-314"><a id="_idTextAnchor412"/>Areas for partial application</h1>
			<p>Although partial<a id="_idIndexMarker554"/> application is used in quite similar scenarios to the currying ones, the possibility of having more than just one parameter makes it more applicable. Here are some good places to apply <span class="No-Break">partial application:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Configuration management</strong>: In systems where configurations vary slightly between environments or parts of the application, partial application can simplify configuration management by pre-setting <span class="No-Break">common parameters.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User interface events</strong>: In GUI programming, event handlers often require specific parameters that don’t change once set. Partial application allows developers to prepare these handlers with predefined arguments, making the code cleaner and easier <span class="No-Break">to manage.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">API integration</strong>: When interacting with external APIs, certain parameters such as API keys and user tokens remain constant across requests. Partially applying these parameters to API request functions can simplify function calls and enhance security by isolating <span class="No-Break">sensitive data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Logging and monitoring</strong>: A common requirement across applications, logging often involves repetitive information such as log levels and categories. Partial applications can create specialized logging functions that are easier to use and reduce the likelihood <span class="No-Break">of errors.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data processing pipelines</strong>: In scenarios involving data transformation and processing, functions often need specific settings or operations to be applied consistently. Partial applications can preconfigure these functions with the necessary settings, making the pipeline more modular <span class="No-Break">and reusable.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-315"><a id="_idTextAnchor413"/>Example of partially applying a function for configuration settings</h2>
			<p>Consider a scenario in a content management system where different types of content require specific rendering settings. The function that handles rendering might take multiple parameters, but many of these parameters are common across <span class="No-Break">content types.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor414"/>Standard rendering function</h2>
			<p>Let’s say we have a function to render our content that takes multiple parameters and can be used only <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>when we have all <span class="No-Break">of them:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public string RenderContent(string content, string format, int width, int height, string theme)
{
     // Render content based on the provided settings
     return $"Rendering {content} as {format} in {theme} theme with dimensions {width}x{height}";
}</pre>			<h2 id="_idParaDest-317"><a id="_idTextAnchor415"/>Partially applied function</h2>
			<p>To simplify the use of this function across the application, particularly when most content uses a standard format and theme, you can partially apply these <span class="No-Break">common parameters:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public Func&lt;string, int, int, string&gt; RenderStandardContent()
{
     string defaultFormat = "HTML";
     string defaultTheme = "Light";
     return (content, width, height) =&gt; RenderContent(content, defaultFormat, width, height, defaultTheme);
}
var renderStandard = RenderStandardContent();
string renderedOutput = renderStandard("Hello, world!", 800, 600);
Console.WriteLine(renderedOutput);</pre>			<p>This approach allows us to use the <strong class="source-inline">renderStandard</strong> function without repeatedly specifying the format and theme. You must be thinking now that we could use default parameters here and get rid of all this partial application. But what if we have not just one “standard” way of rendering, but several of them: desktop, cellphone, and tablet? That’s when we create specific functions for each case with shared code in the “main” <strong class="source-inline">RenderContent</strong> function. It looks like an inheritance for functions <span class="No-Break">of sorts.</span></p>
			<p>After studying currying and partial application, Steve couldn’t help but feel a bit overwhelmed. He reached out to Julia to voice <span class="No-Break">his apprehensions.</span></p>
			<p>Steve: <em class="italic">Julia, while I see the potential of these techniques, I’m worried about the increased complexity and potential performance issues. How do you manage those challenges in </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">your projects?</em></span></p>
			<p>Julia: <em class="italic">Those are valid points, Steve. It’s true that currying and partial application have their challenges and limitations. Let’s go through some of them and discuss strategies to </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">overcome them...</em></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-318"><a id="_idTextAnchor416"/>Challenges and limitations</h1>
			<p>After studying <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>currying and partial application, Steve <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>couldn’t help but feel a bit overwhelmed. He reached out to Julia to voice <span class="No-Break">his apprehensions.</span></p>
			<p>Steve: <em class="italic">Julia, while I see the potential of these techniques, I’m worried about the increased complexity and potential performance issues. How do you manage those challenges in </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">your projects?</em></span></p>
			<p>Julia: <em class="italic">Those are valid points, Steve. It’s true that currying and partial application have their challenges and limitations. The following are </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">some examples:</em></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increased complexity</strong>: For developers unfamiliar with functional programming, currying and partial application can make the code seem more complex and harder to understand, leading to a steeper <span class="No-Break">learning curve.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance overheads</strong>: Every function call in .NET involves a certain overhead, and currying increases the number of function calls by transforming a single multi-parameter function into multiple single-parameter functions. This can potentially impact performance, especially in <span class="No-Break">performance-critical applications.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Debugging difficulty</strong>: Debugging curried functions can be more challenging because the flow of data and execution is spread across multiple function calls rather than being concentrated in a single <span class="No-Break">function body.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><em class="italic">Sounds a bit scary, but there is no need to worry because we can overcome these challenges using the </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">following strategies:</em></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Education and training</strong>: Providing training sessions and resources on functional programming concepts can help team members understand and effectively use currying and <span class="No-Break">partial applications.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Selective use</strong>: Apply<a id="_idIndexMarker558"/> currying and partial application<a id="_idIndexMarker559"/> selectively, focusing on areas where they provide clear benefits, such as in configuration management and API interaction, rather than applying <span class="No-Break">them universally.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance monitoring</strong>: Always monitor the performance implications of currying in your specific context. Use profiling tools to identify any bottlenecks and refactor the code if necessary to <span class="No-Break">optimize performance.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhanced debugging techniques</strong>: Utilize advanced debugging tools and techniques, such as conditional breakpoints and call stack analysis, to better manage the debugging of <span class="No-Break">curried functions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration strategies</strong>: When working within an object-oriented framework, integrate functional programming techniques gradually and ensure they complement rather than complicate <span class="No-Break">the architecture.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While currying and partial application can introduce some complexity and challenges, with the right strategies and tools, these challenges can be <span class="No-Break">managed effectively.</span></p>
			<p>As they wrapped up their discussion on currying and partial application, Steve <span class="No-Break">looked thoughtful.</span></p>
			<p>Steve: <em class="italic">This has been really enlightening, Julia. I can see how these techniques could make our tower defense game code more flexible </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">and maintainable.</em></span></p>
			<p>Julia: <em class="italic">Exactly, Steve! And remember, like any tool in programming, the key is knowing when and how to apply these </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">concepts effectively.</em></span></p>
			<p>Steve: <em class="italic">Thanks, Julia. I’m looking forward to trying these out in our next </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">coding session!</em></span></p>
			<p>Julia smiled, pleased <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>with Steve’s enthusiasm and <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>progress in functional <span class="No-Break">programming concepts.</span></p>

			<p>Refactor the <strong class="source-inline">AttackEnemy</strong> function using currying, allowing the <strong class="source-inline">towerType</strong> to be preset for multiple uses throughout the game while accepting dynamic inputs for <strong class="source-inline">enemyId</strong> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">damage</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public void AttackEnemy(TowerTypes towerType, int enemyId, int damage)
{
   Console.WriteLine($"Tower {towerType} attacks enemy {enemyId} for {damage} damage.");
}</pre>			<h2 id="_idParaDest-321"><a id="_idTextAnchor419"/>Exercise 2</h2>
			<p>Apply partial application to create a function for quick setup of standard game settings where the <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> is predefined but allows for dynamic setting of <strong class="source-inline">difficultyLevel</strong> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">isMultiplayer</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public void SetGameSettings(string map, int difficultyLevel, bool isMultiplayer)
{
   Console.WriteLine($"Setting game on map {map} with difficulty {difficultyLevel}, multiplayer: {isMultiplayer}");
}</pre>			<h2 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor420"/>Exercise 3</h2>
			<p>Curry this function so that it can first accept a <strong class="source-inline">userRole</strong> and then return another function that takes a <strong class="source-inline">feature</strong>, determining whether the specified role has access <span class="No-Break">to it:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public bool CheckGameFeatureAccess(UserRoles userRole, GameFeatures feature)
{
    return _gameFeatureManager.HasAccess(userRole, feature);
}</pre>			<p>These exercises are tailored to help you apply currying and partial application within the context of a mobile tower defense game. By practicing these techniques, you’ll enhance the functionality and scalability of the game’s code base, making it easier to manage and extend. Remember, the more you practice these functional programming techniques, the more proficient you’ll become in building sophisticated <span class="No-Break">game logic.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor421"/>Solutions</h1>
			<p>Here are the solutions to the exercises related to currying and partial application within the context of a mobile tower defense game. These solutions demonstrate how to implement the concepts discussed and provide practical examples of their use in <span class="No-Break">game development.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor422"/>Solution 1</h2>
			<p>To refactor the <strong class="source-inline">AttackEnemy</strong> function using currying, we first define the original function and then <span class="No-Break">transform it:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public Func&lt;int, int, void&gt; CurriedAttack(TowerTypes towerType)
{
   return (enemyId, damage) =&gt;
   {
      Console.WriteLine($"Tower {towerType} attacks enemy {enemyId} for {damage} damage.");
   };
}
var attackWithCannon = CurriedAttack(TowerTypes.Cannon);
attackWithCannon(1, 50); // Attack enemy 1 with 50 damage
attackWithCannon(2, 75); // Attack enemy 2 with 75 damage</pre>			<p>This curried function allows the <strong class="source-inline">towerType</strong> to be set once and reused for multiple attacks, enhancing code reusability and <span class="No-Break">reducing redundancy.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-325"><a id="_idTextAnchor423"/>Solution 2</h2>
			<p>Use partial application for simplifying game <span class="No-Break">settings configuration:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public Func&lt;int, bool, void&gt; ConfigureWithMap(Maps map)
{
   return (difficultyLevel, isMultiplayer) =&gt;
   {
      Console.WriteLine($"Setting game on map {map} with difficulty {difficultyLevel}, multiplayer: {isMultiplayer}");
   };
}
var configureForMapDesert = ConfigureWithMap(Maps.Desert);
// Configure for Desert map with difficulty 5 and multiplayer enabled
configureForMapDesert(5, true);
// Configure for Desert map with difficulty 3 and multiplayer disabled
configureForMapDesert(3, false);</pre>			<p>This function partially applies the map setting, allowing other settings such as <strong class="source-inline">difficultyLevel</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">isMultiplayer</strong> to be <span class="No-Break">configured dynamically.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-326"><a id="_idTextAnchor424"/>Solution 3</h2>
			<p>Implement a curried function for managing permissions based on user roles <span class="No-Break">and actions:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public Func&lt;GameFeatures, bool&gt; CurriedCheckPermission(UserRoles userRole)
{
   return (feature) =&gt;
   {
      return _gameFeatureManager.HasAccess(userRole, feature);
   };
}
var checkAdminPermissions = CurriedCheckPermission(UserRoles.Admin);
bool canEdit = checkAdminPermissions(GameFeatures.EditLevel);
bool canPlay = checkAdminPermissions(GameFeatures.PlayGame);
Console.WriteLine($"Admin permissions - Edit: {canEdit}, Play: {canPlay}");</pre>			<p>This curried function simplifies permission checks by setting the <strong class="source-inline">userRole</strong> once and allowing dynamic checks for various features, streamlining the permission <span class="No-Break">management process.</span></p>
			<p>These solutions demonstrate practical applications of currying and partial application, improving the structure and maintainability of code within a mobile tower defense game. By implementing these techniques, developers can enhance both the flexibility and readability of their <span class="No-Break">game logic.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor425"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we explored currying and partial application. Currying transforms a multi-parameter function into a sequence of single-parameter functions, each accepting one argument and returning another function ready to take the next argument. This technique is particularly beneficial for creating configurable and highly <span class="No-Break">modular code.</span></p>
			<p>Partial application involves fixing some arguments of a function and creating a new function that requires fewer arguments. This approach is invaluable in scenarios where certain parameters are repeatedly used with the same values, as it simplifies function calls and <span class="No-Break">reduces redundancy.</span></p>
			<p>If something is still not clear, use the examples provided in this chapter – modify them, experiment with them, and integrate them with your projects. In other words, see how it works in practice. Whether simplifying configuration management, making event handling more straightforward, or reducing the complexity of API interactions, currying and partial application can help you to reduce complexity in function calls, enhance code modularity and readability, and overall, bring your programs to the next level in terms of <span class="No-Break">functional programming.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will sum up all we’ve learned about pipelines and composition from the previous chapters, add more real-world scenarios, and discuss more advanced topics such as error handling, testing, and <span class="No-Break">performance consideration.</span></p>
