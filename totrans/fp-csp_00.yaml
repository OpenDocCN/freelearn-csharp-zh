  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is designed to introduce you to the powerful paradigm of functional
    programming within the context of C#. As C# continues to evolve, it increasingly
    embraces functional programming concepts, allowing developers to write more concise,
    maintainable, and robust code. This book will guide you through the journey of
    understanding and applying functional programming principles in C#, from basic
    concepts to advanced techniques.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this first part, we lay the groundwork for understanding functional programming.
    We’ll start by introducing the core concepts of functional programming and how
    they apply to C#. You’ll learn about the crucial distinction between expressions
    and statements, and how to write more expressive code. We’ll then explore pure
    functions and how to minimize side effects, which are fundamental to functional
    programming. Finally, we’ll discuss honest functions and effective ways to handle
    null values, setting the stage for more robust code design.
