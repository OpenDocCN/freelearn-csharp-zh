<p class="mce-root"><span>In this book so far, we have discussed various patterns, styles, and code. During this discussion, our aim was to understand the patterns and practices to write neat, clean, and robust code. This appendix will mainly focus on practices. The practice is very important when it comes to adhering to any rule or any kind of coding style. As a developer, you should rehearse coding on a daily basis. According to the old proverb, <em>practice makes man perfect</em></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">This is shown through the fact that skills such as playing a game, driving a car, reading, or writing do not come instantly. Instead, we should perfect these skills over time and with practice. For example, when you start driving, you start it slowly. There, you need to remember when to press the clutch, when to press the brake, how far they need to turn the steering wheel, and so on. However, once the driver is well acquainted with driving, then there is no need to remember these steps; they come naturally. This is because of practice.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this <span>appendix</span>, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use case discussion</li>
<li>Best practices</li>
<li>Other design patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>Put simply, a use case is a pre-creation or a symbolic representation of a business scenario. For example, we can represent our login page use case in a pictorial/symbolic representation. In our example, users are trying to log into a system. If the login succeeds, they can enter the system. If it fails, the system informs the users that the login attempt failed. Refer to the following diagram of a <strong>login</strong> use case:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e8594ebb-7aa1-4044-8605-a1fb0732da21.png" style=""/></div>
<p>In the preceding diagram, users called <strong>User1</strong>, <strong>User2</strong>, and <strong>User3</strong> are trying to enter the system using the login functionality of the application. If the login attempt is successful, the user can access the system. If not, the application notifies the user that login wasn't successful and the user can't access the system. The preceding diagram is much clearer than our actual verbose description, where we are describing this diagram. The diagram is also self-explanatory.</p>

<p class="mce-root">In the previous section, we discussed the login functionality with the help of symbolic representation. You might have noticed the symbols that are used in the diagram. The notations or symbols used in the previous diagram are part of a symbolic language called <strong>Unified Modeling Language</strong>. This is a way of visualizing our program, software, or even a class.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The symbol or notation used in the UML has evolved from the work of Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, and the Rational Software Corporation.</div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Best practices</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As we have established, practice is a habit that occurs in our daily activities. In software engineering—where software is engineered and not manufactured—we have to practice in order to write good quality code. There may be more points that explain the best practices involved in software engineering. Let's discuss them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short but simplified code</strong>: This is a very basic thing that does require practice. Developers should use short but simplified code daily in order to write concise code and adhere to this practice in their daily life. The code should be clean and not repeat itself. Clean code and code simplification was covered in previous chapters; if you missed this topic, please revisit <a href="e8666bee-88b0-4d5d-a62f-ee8aa27f3e29.xhtml">Chapter</a> <a href="e8666bee-88b0-4d5d-a62f-ee8aa27f3e29.xhtml">2</a>, <em>Modern Software Design Patterns and Principles</em>. Take a look at the following example of concise code:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">public class Math<br/>{<br/>    public int Add(int a, int b) =&gt; a + b;<br/>    public float Add(float a, float b) =&gt; a + b;<br/>    public decimal Add(decimal a, decimal b) =&gt; a + b;<br/>}</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The preceding code snippet contains a <kbd>Math</kbd> class with three <kbd>Add</kbd> methods. These methods are written to calculate the sum of two integer numbers and the sum of two float and decimal numbers. The <kbd>Add(float a, float b)</kbd> and <kbd>Add(decimal a, decimal b)</kbd> <span>methods </span>are the overloaded methods of <kbd>Add (int a, int b)</kbd>. The previous code example represents a scenario where the requirements are to make a single method with a output of the int, float, or decimal datatype.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unit testing</strong>: This is an integral part of development when we want to test our code by writing code. <strong>Test-driven development</strong> (<strong>TDD</strong>) is one of the best practices that one should adhere to. We have discussed TDD in <a href="232b63cb-5006-431d-8378-b7e2ba4c1119.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Implementing Design Patterns for Web Applications - Part 2</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code consistency</strong>: Nowadays, there are very rare opportunities for a developer to work alone. A developer mostly works in a team, meaning that it is very important for there to be code consistency throughout the team. Code consistency can refer to code style. There are a few recommended practices and coding conversions that developers should use regularly while writing programs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">There are many ways to declare a variable. Here is one of the best examples for variable declaration:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">namespace Implement<br/>{<br/>    public class Consume<br/>    {<br/>        BestPractices.Math math = new BestPractices.Math();<br/>    }<br/>}</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In the previous code, we have declared a <kbd>math</kbd> variable of the <kbd>BestPractices.Math</kbd> <span>type. </span>Here, <kbd>BestPractices</kbd> is our namespace and <kbd>Math</kbd> is the class. If we are not taking <kbd>using</kbd> directives in the code then it's good practice to have fully namespace qualified variables.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Official docs for the C# language describe these conventions very elaborately. You can refer to them here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions</a>.<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code reviews</strong>: Making mistakes is human nature, and this also happens in development. Code review is the first step in practicing writing bug-free code and uncovering the unpredictable mistakes in the code.</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Other design patterns</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>So far, we have covered various design patterns and principles including the best practices to write code. This section will summarize the following patterns and guide you to write quality and robust code. The details and implementation of these patterns are beyond the scope of this book.</p>
<p>We have already covered the following patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>GoF patterns</li>
<li>Design principles</li>
<li>Software development life cycle patterns</li>
<li>Test-driven development</li>
</ul>
<p>In this book, we have covered a lot of topics and developed a sample application (console and web). This is not the end of the world, there are more things to learn in the world.</p>
<p>We can list more patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Space-based architectural pattern</strong>: <strong>Space-based Pattern</strong> (<strong>SBP</strong>s) are patterns that help with application scalability by minimizing the factors that limit application scaling. These patterns are also known as <strong>cloud architecture patterns</strong>. We have covered many of them in <a href="002c9eec-cbca-4771-b5b0-45048acaa489.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Coding for the Cloud</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging patterns</strong>: These patterns are used to connect two applications based on messaging (sent in the form of packets). These packets or messages are transmitting using a logical path on which various applications connect (these logical paths are known as channels). There might be scenarios where one application has multiple messages; in that case, not all messages can be sent at once. In a scenario where there are multiple messages, a channel can be called a queue and several messages can be queued up in a channel and can be accessed from various applications at the same point in time.</li>
<li><strong>Additional patterns for Domain-Driven Design—layered architecture:</strong> This depicts separation of concerns, where the concept of layered architecture comes in. Behind the scenes, the basic idea for developing an application is that it should be structured into conceptual layers. In general, applications have four conceptual layers:
<ul>
<li><strong>User interface</strong>: This layer has everything where the end user interacts, this layer accepts the commands and then provides the information accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Application layer</strong>: This layer is more towards transaction management, data translation, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Domain layer</strong>: This layer sticks to behavior and the state of the domain.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure layer</strong>: Everything happens here related to repositories, adapters, and frameworks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Containerized application patterns</strong>: Before we dig into this, we should know what containers are. A container is lightweight, portable software; it defines an environment under which software can run. Generally, software that is running inside the container is designed as a single-purpose application. For containerized applications the most important pattern is as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker image building patterns</strong>: This pattern is based on the Builder pattern from GoF design patterns, which we discussed in <a href="3a038a92-9207-4232-9acd-d17cb24da6c5.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Implementing Design Patterns-Basics Part 1</em>.<span class="packt_screen"> </span>It only describes the setup so that it can be used to build a container. In addition to this, there is a multi-stage image building pattern that provides a way to build multiple images from a single Dockerfile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The aim of this appendix was to highlight the importance of practice. In this chapter, we discussed how we can practice enhancing our skills. Once we achieve the skills, there is no need to remember the steps to achieve a specific task. We covered and discussed a few use cases from the real world, discussed best practices from our day-to-day code, and other design patterns that can be used in our daily practice to enhance our skills. Finally, we wrapped up the last chapter of this book and learned that with practice and the adaptation of various patterns, developers can improve their code quality.</p>
