<div><p class="calibre_1">Accessibility</p><p class="calibre_2">In the previous chapter, we learned about the User Experience and the best practices in User Interface design. We'll now learn how to make these, and any other parts of the game, more accessible; that is, easier to use, understand, and relate to.</p><p class="calibre_2">To begin with, we need to find ways to create a steady and frictionless introduction to the game world and the rules governing it. We then have to ensure that the game can provide a highly playable experience to players that are less experienced, skilled, or capable (be it cognitively or physically).</p><p class="calibre_2">Last but not least, even the best games often start in a bad place, and there's no better way to find things to improve than to test our games on potential players. We'll spend the final half of the chapter on the art of usability testing, and arm you with the expertise required to plan and execute your very own playtesting sessions!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Increasing accessibility</p><p class="calibre_2">When thinking of making our games more accessible, we often narrow our focus to the overall pacing and difficulty of the in-game challenges. While balancing itself is important enough to warrant a whole chapter (and we've done just that in this book), we first need to identify the ways in which we can make the core of our product fundamentally more approachable.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Reducing cognitive load</p><p class="calibre_2">Games that require good memory, observational skills, abstract thinking, planning, and fact association are all at risk of being very cognitively demanding.</p><p class="calibre_2">High-level games of chess immediately come to mind as an example of a difficult mental challenge. And yet, the base rules and mechanics of chess can be understood and memorized by young children, making chess an accessible game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Complex and mentally demanding games only become inaccessible if the player is stuck or struggles to learn the rules and improve. To make the game more accessible in this department, try the following.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Avoiding mental challenges with binary outcomes</p><p class="calibre_2">Adventure games in the 1990s were full of abstract puzzles that provided a binary mental challenge—you either got the solution, or you were left to struggle on your own. Players would often end up scouring the game world, scanning every single screen, and trying every possible item combination. Nowadays, a game with that degree of friction will likely frustrate the player to a point of quitting. When possible, avoid mandatory puzzles with binary win/lose conditions, or make sure to include a passive or active hint system.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">If you are looking for inspiration, try the games in the Professor Layton series, where hundreds of clever (and often very difficult) puzzles are paired with a well-implemented hint system. In most cases, a puzzle has three hints that can be purchased for one Hint Coin each, and a fourth Super Hint (solution) that can be bought for two Hint Coins. Hint Coins themselves are a limited resource that are awarded for exploring and interacting with the environment (tapping on mailboxes, plant pots, cats, and so on). Players have to work hard to find the hints, which means that using them doesn't feel like cheating.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Limiting initial complexity and interplay between rules</p><p class="calibre_2">Products that have elaborate rulesets and multi-layered mechanics often require a huge amount of practice on behalf of the players.</p><p class="calibre_2">As game creators, we often have the desire to design elegant systems where multiple elements affect one another in discrete ways. It's a great ambition to have, but one that can lead us to make an overwhelming experience.</p><p class="calibre_2">A new mechanic or rule should only enter the stage once the previous one has been fully explored and understood. There's no harm in removing or limiting certain aspects of the game for the purpose of teaching the player. For example, don't ask the players to build a deck of cards before they have a chance to play them, and do not introduce the pressure of maintaining limited time/turns/health/ammo/resources until they are really required.</p><p class="calibre_2">We’ll dedicate more time to the subject of introducing and explaining game mechanics later in this chapter.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Lowering the knowledge cliffs</p><p class="calibre_2">A great example of a knowledge cliff can be found in many multiplayer arena games like League of Legends and DOTA 2. Both titles feature dozens of items and hundreds of characters (each with multiple, complex abilities) that players need to understand and memorize. With numbers this high, the knowledge cliff would be significant even if the only variables were simple attribute changes. As it stands, these characters and items are also full of new mechanics—a perfect storm of overwhelming quantity and complexity! No wonder they are some of the least accessible games on the market.</p><p class="calibre_2">In this situation, limiting the content is the easiest solution. This is why Valve has reduced the number of playable heroes in the first 25 games of DOTA 2 from over 110 to just 20, with new players only able to play against one another. They've also introduced a new Turbo mode, which decreases death penalties, changes the pacing, and removes some of the restrictive rules on buying items. Even with all of these changes, there's still a long way to go, as DOTA 2 remains to be one of the hardest and most punishing games to pick up for newcomers.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember, games like LoL and DOTA are exceptions that managed to survive and reach critical mass without good onboarding, on top of a hugely dedicated player base. The very same strategy can and most likely will sink most other games.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Limiting the complexity of interaction</p><p class="calibre_2">We've already covered input methods and controls at length in <a href="index_split_313.html#filepos716889"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 11</tt></a>, User Interface and User Experience. Enabling full control remapping and reducing input complexity goes a long way in increasing accessibility, while rarely leaving a negative impact on the game mechanics.</p><p class="calibre_2">We can do better though! Can you imagine a way to make your game playable with only one hand? How about one finger? The outlandish one-finger restriction is often an essential requirement for mobile game controls. After all, the second hand may be clinging to a coffee cup or a bus handrail. Certainly, not all games can cater to such requirements, but trying to accommodate to them while maintaining playability for the target audience is a goal we should all aspire towards, for the sake of all players.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">There are often ways in which you can easily bypass the necessity of multiple simultaneous inputs. For example, in first person shooters, aiming down sights, sprinting and crouching can all be toggle actions (press to turn ON/OFF), instead of requiring a key or button to be constantly held down.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Even if your controls are simple, executing them quickly and accurately can be overly challenging. Difficult execution is likely to be a problem in any real-time game, from quick pattern matching in Guitar Hero to the expert hand-eye coordination and reflexes needed to play Counter-Strike. Make sure to provide a set of slower paced, less punishing challenges for the inexperienced and less capable players. This can be done via difficulty settings, rule adaptations, and multiplayer matchmaking. We'll look into ways of adjusting difficulty in <a href="index_split_398.html#filepos890374"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 13</tt></a>, Balancing.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Maintaining visual clarity</p><p class="calibre_2">If players cannot easily distinguish, read, and understand the state of the game and contents of the screen, they won't be able to interact with the game effectively. Consider the following tips to improve the visual clarity in your games:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Hide or de-prioritize any unnecessary information in the user interface.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Separate the enemies and interactive objects from the background. Be it via shapes, outlines, color palettes, or materials and shaders.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Use clear and uniform visual language in your level design. For example, in Tomb Raider, any climbable wall is covered in white paint.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Do not obscure critical information (player position, threats) with overwhelming and long-lasting visual effects.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Visualize the state of the game. Use text, icons, and symbols to clearly indicate the state of game-actors. For example, health bars, damage numbers, status symbols, and so on. Adhere to the principles of good game feedback highlighted in the previous chapter.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Cater to color-blind people, which comprise 10% of your male playerbase. Provide menu options to swap the colors of important elements such as map and target markers, health bars, and so on, and utilize different shapes to distinguish between various parts of the user interface. For example, UI markers could be circular for friendlies and triangular for hostiles.</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Making audio optional</p><p class="calibre_2">Unless your game revolves around audio design, be it spoken lines of dialogue (for example, Thomas Was Alone, Stanley's Parable), music (Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Audiosurf) or sound cues (for example, footsteps and shots fired in Counter-Strike and Rainbow Six: Siege), you should avoid relying on audio cues. On top of isolating hearing-impaired players, you're also disadvancing people who play with low or muted sound. The probability of the latter is extremely high in the mobile and portable game market.</p><p class="calibre_2">As for supporting hearing-impaired players, on top of integrating subtitles, you should also consider putting in options to enable closed-captions (textual descriptions of sound effects). For example, door creaks or loud explosion.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Restricting negative consequences</p><p class="calibre_2">Respawning at checkpoints, replaying stages, equipment and character removal, and last but not least, the states of permanent failure (aka permadeath); these are some of the most common examples of negative consequences.</p><p class="calibre_2">In most cases, taking away a player's progress is a surefire way of making your game less accessible. It's especially true if you pair it with technical issues, failure to teach game systems, and a lack of anticipation and clear feedback. The last thing you want is to leave your audience unaware of the negative consequences and ill-prepared to handle them.</p><p class="calibre_2">Don't get me wrong, failure can be good and motivating, and we obviously want our players to be challenged. But while it's great to have our audience learn from their mistakes, learning through failure is our last line of defense, and the most frustrating way to teach the player.</p><p class="calibre_2">I am not advocating against the use of progress-loss as a consequence, in fact, some of my favorite games are incredibly punishing. However, it's important to recognize the negative effects on accessibility, which are brought by progress removal and permanent fail-states. These mechanics are simply not for everyone, and unless they make up the fabric of your game, consider making them optional.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Building on common knowledge</p><p class="calibre_2">Anchoring your game to another popular product can be handy, but creating a strong reference to the world outside of video games can be even more helpful. This includes popular culture, history, sports, traditions, activities, hobbies, and even the physical properties of the world around us.</p><p class="calibre_2">Ice is slippery, wood catches fire, diamonds are expensive, and Rocket League is kind of like soccer played with cars. The easier it is to draw a parallel between the game world and real world, the less knowledge you'll need to put into player's heads yourself. That said, while removing rules is fine, breaking them in unexpected places can make things very confusing. For example, it's okay if your character doesn't need food to survive, but it's not wise to create a wooden sword that lasts longer than a steel one.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Teaching game systems</p><p class="calibre_2">Teaching and introducing new rules and mechanics is often as difficult as creating them. The first step is, as always, to acknowledge and respect the differing tastes and preferences of your audience, not only towards certain types of games but also the ways in which they like to learn and tackle challenges. You also have to prepare for different levels of exposure to similar games and relatable life experiences.</p><p class="calibre_2">We all have our preferred learning style, and even though researchers are having a hard time settling on a particular definition and categorization, they all seem to agree that each individual is primed towards a particular set of learning techniques. Some people like to listen, some prefer to read, and others still skip all text and try to figure things out by following visual cues.</p><p class="calibre_2">A highly successful strategy is to mix several teaching methods into a combination that works well within the confines of the story, game structure, target platform, and audience.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">Remember, written information, videos, and scripted gameplay are all valid educational tools, but games are an interactive medium, and the most pleasant and effective way of teaching our players is through play itself. The need for tutorial elements can be greatly reduced by providing players with immediate goal clarity, clear feedback from gameplay and interface interactions, and the gradual introduction of new elements. An elegant and clearly presented mechanic has a chance of explaining itself in action.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">In-game teaching techniques</p><p class="calibre_2">There are times when explaining complex game systems to players with little prior experience may be impossible without the strict guidance of carefully crafted tutorials. These direct teaching techniques include some of the following:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Beginner's training: Scripted and ring-fenced tutorials at the beginning of the game may run the risk of being perceived as unnecessary or frustrating, but they are still a highly effective tool. For one, you have the full control of the game state and the level design and are clear to withhold any progress until all instructions are followed and tasks accomplished. A skilled and experienced player should be able to complete your tutorials quickly; make sure to remove any unnecessary pauses and keep the long demonstrations and speeches for those who really need them. There's nothing more frustrating than being locked away from your controls while a drill sergeant takes 20 seconds to tell you how to reload and pull the trigger.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Context-sensitive tutorials: Well crafted tutorials appear where and when you need them. Try dividing your tutorial content into smaller chunks and implement a set of simple rules and conditions to gauge when and if to launch them. For example, in Transformers: Earth Wars, the tutorial for our item fusion mechanic requires that the player has at least eight unequipped items and none of them are level 2. This means that the player did not figure out the feature by themselves, yet they have enough spare items to easily afford it. While it may be easy to preemptively summon a friendly tutorial fairy whenever something new appears, it is a much finer art to recognize the stress points in your game and anticipate a good moment to address them. Launching the right tutorial at the right time is the secret to a receptive and grateful player.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Optional training segments: Side-quests, practice missions, and glowing learn more buttons next to newly acquired tools. These are some of the ways in which you can inject knowledge without affecting the main storyline. After all, advanced players should not be forced to learn things they already know, and should be given a way to skip past this content safely without losing out. But what happens if they skip by mistake? What if players suffer later because they were simply impatient or misunderstood what they were about to learn? These concerns are valid and can be addressed with a set of fail-safes. Optional training elements should be crystal clear on what they entail (in other words, make sure to expose your curriculum) and accessible later on when players decide they need them.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">On the other end of the spectrum, we have indirect teaching techniques, which are either less invasive or naturally intertwined with the fabric of the game:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Leaving information in the environment: Sometimes the state of the environment can provide you with all the clues you need. Back in the previous chapters, we spoke of environmental storytelling; in the case of Dead Space, the writings on the wall played a role in teaching the players how to battle the undead. Less obvious clues require more attention to detail and may turn the teaching into a puzzle-solving exercise. Who said that tutorial sections can't be turned into enjoyable obstacles to overcome? As you venture deep into the creepy woods, you encounter metal traps, some of them with their jaws clasped on long forgotten skeletons. There's also a few disabled traps with rocks (which you can pick up) next to them. Soon after, an unsprung trap is blocking your way and a rock lays right in front of you. The connection soon becomes obvious.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Teaching by example: Companion characters (such as Alyx in Half-Life 2) do not need to talk to the player to pass on knowledge. As you shoot and bash your way through alien-infested Earth, you observe and copy the skills and behavior of your partner. Should the players have no friendly characters to rely on, they can always follow the footsteps of their enemies. If you see an enemy character (or player) perform a rocket-jump, it won't take you long to try one yourself!</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Reinforcement: Since the dawn of time, positive reinforcement is one of the most effective ways to direct human behavior. Players who are rewarded for certain actions with praise, resources, or sheer satisfaction will continue on the path that leads to continued and escalating reward. Investing time and effort into learning new game systems should come with clear rewards and be presented as an opportunity to gain an edge in the future.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Accessible information: Glowing learn more buttons, mouse-over tooltips, control hints, and text labels on buttons are just a few examples of supplying players with information that's either out in the open, or easily accessible at their convenience. These tools alone may not be enough to teach players about complex game systems and interactions, but they certainly make the game easier to figure out.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Failure: Teaching solely by trial and error is a certain way of making your players frustrated and the game seem unfair. Nevertheless, it's important to acknowledge the simple yet powerful message that a punishment can hold. If players are losing, the least you can do is explain why and how they've failed and what they can do to improve. Be it by showing a so-called kill-cam in a multiplayer shooter, or by explaining the works of the trap, enemy, or game mechanic responsible for the fail-state.</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Teaching outside gameplay</p><p class="calibre_2">A lot of detailed and nuanced information can be exposed outside of the main gameplay experience. However, while these techniques are great at covering specialist knowledge or diving deep into the stats and non-crucial mechanics, they should be used as a secondary source of information—something that cannot be relied upon or expected from players. In this category we can place:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Loading tips: Loading screens are a great place for tips and hints that are not critical to player's progression. Button shortcuts, advanced or obscure mechanics, equipment highlights, and repetition of important information are all valid choices. You can also use this space to place a quick story reminder, a synopsis of the current act/mission or the backstory of various characters and locations. When working on a loading tips system, it's best to ensure it takes player's state into account. This way, a seasoned player who's just about to face the last boss won't be patronized by an unnecessary tip on how to jump, nor will a beginner face info about advanced end-game combos.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Training cutscenes and videos: Nowadays, many complex games that are still undergoing heavy development rely on narrated video tutorials on platforms like YouTube. This is a good way to transfer knowledge to a dedicated fanbase, but it cannot be depended upon for the final product. If you ever end up creating external video content, make sure to link to it or embed it in your game. In-game cutscenes are a much more dependable way of teaching your players, but they tend to be much more expensive and should not be invested in early.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Game manuals
and guides: The paper manuals and guides are largely a thing of the past, and not many users ever seek out the digital versions. Unless you're required to make a manual by the platform holder or are preparing a deluxe printed edition, you should skip this effort and channel it right into the in-game teaching.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">In-game knowledge banks: Player journals, PDA's, encyclopedias, and databases are a great way to store easily accessible information. A great example of such a system would be the Codex in the Mass Effect series—a place chock full of story content, character bios, backstory, in-game technology, and of course, our beloved tutorials.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">External wikis: Official and unofficial knowledge databases (wikis) let highly engaged users dive deep into nuances of your game. Such wikis are chuck-full of detailed unit and equipment stats, patch notes, gameplay hints and walkthroughs. You may not want to invest time into creating an official wiki (especially for a single-player, story-driven game), but no matter what you do, make sure to support the community if they choose to create a knowledge database of their own. As for competitive multiplayer titles, up-to-date wikis can be a pillar of a healthy community.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing: The power of engaged fan-base is truly something to behold. Complex and poorly explained games such as League of Legends and DOTA 2 owe a lot of their success to the willingness of their community to on-board and teach one another. Outside of friend lists, guilds, and alliances, you can encourage mentoring behavior by introducing referral programs that depend on the referred player's progress, as well as supporting replay sharing, spectator modes, and a chat system that functions across the whole game.</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Best practices</p><p class="calibre_2">In this section, we've assembled a set of tips and guidelines that can help make your onboarding experiences more focused, organized, and effective.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Don't kill (with) the messenger</p><p class="calibre_2">Our attempts at teaching the player are at constant risk of making them either bored or overwhelmed. If possible, your tutorial sections should blend in seamlessly with the rest of the game. Longwinded training missions and practice rounds all run a risk of tiring (when does this end?) and even patronizing your audience (I know this already!). The latter was especially true when it came to Clippy, the paperclip from the old Microsoft Office. The obnoxious, intrusive, and seemingly clueless nature of Clippy became a running joke. Yet, similar training became much more approachable when delivered by an adorable yellow puppy. The tutor, the method, and the ability to skip ahead all play a role in making a less polarizing experience.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Understand the effects of the training mode</p><p class="calibre_2">By playing games, we enter safe simulations in which we can learn about the world without any real consequences. Therefore, marking a part of any game as training is equal to creating a safe simulation within the safe simulation. So in spite of learning throughout the entire gameplay experience, many players regard in-game training segments as a waste of time, and eagerly anticipate the beginning of the real game. If you find yourself relying on such segment, make sure that parts of it are skippable and clearly marked as optional.</p><p class="calibre_2">You can also turn certain tutorial sections and functionalities ON or OFF based on the difficulty setting selected by the player. If someone is playing a shooter on a nightmare difficulty setting they most likely don't have to be told how to move and look around.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Focus your efforts on innovative and obscure</p><p class="calibre_2">Your teaching strategy should take into account not only the complexity of the game but also the amount of innovation. Focus first on the experimental parts of the game, knowing that the more familiar mechanics have already been successfully taught before (and therefore a solid reference for teaching them can probably be found and adapted).</p><p class="calibre_2">Following that, look out for parts of your game that may not get in the way of immediate progress, yet run the risk of having a long-term effect. For example, players may not realize the importance of particular resources and throw them away, only to realize 30 hours later that by doing so they're now lacking the necessary materials to upgrade their equipment.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Pick the right moment to work on tutorials</p><p class="calibre_2">You'd ideally want the core game mechanics to be as close to final as possible before spending significant time and effort on polishing your onboarding experience and tutorials. Early on, the tutorial budget is better spent on in-game text and visual feedback. In the short term, recording a tutorial video or explaining the game in person are also valid approaches. Once you start exposing your game to more people and enter external testing, you'll likely have the basics more or less set in stone, making the time spent on tutorials time well spent.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Make a tutorial plan</p><p class="calibre_2">Approaching tutorial creation can be a daunting task. To make things easier, you'll need to formulate a plan. If you have a content lifespan
document or a player progression flow at hand (both mentioned in <a href="index_split_070.html#filepos210445"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 3</tt></a>, Scoping a Game Project), use them as a basis. Otherwise, make a basic timeline of the player's progression and a separate list of important game mechanics.</p><p class="calibre_2">Now, try to match both lists and note the teaching techniques you could use. Ensure that you do not overwhelm the player with too many unrelated concepts at once. At this stage, you may find out that parts of the game or its level design need to be changed or swapped around to make things fit better. This is a big part of the reason why the beginning areas of the game should be postponed until the base mechanics and the lion's share of the content are finished.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Try a 3 step process</p><p class="calibre_2">When dealing with guided tutorials that require active participation from the players, it helps to break them down into three steps:</p><div></div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Context: Tell the players what they are doing and why. For example, Use your attacks to knock the other contestants out of the arena!</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Interaction: Guide the players through the execution phase, if possible, more than once and with escalating difficulty. For example, Press X to attack the skeleton... &lt;skeleton defeated&gt; "Great! But... it looks like there's more coming! Get ready!".</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Summary: Solidify the knowledge and highlight the future use of the mechanic, be it with text, images or aspirational goals. For example, Try to unlock new skills and find new gadgets to see what they do!. The summary is also a good place to make immediate use of everything that the player's learned so far in a real, unguided scenario.</li></ol><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Test and iterate</p><p class="calibre_2">No tutorial you create will ever be perfect. As with game mechanics, you have to start somewhere and iron the quirks as you go. If you're struggling to choose between a few different approaches and have access to a big enough pool of test candidates, it's often best to take the extra time to try them all simultaneously on different segments of the player base, then pick the best.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Some things are best left unexplained</p><p class="calibre_2">We spoke at length about how to explain the complexities of your game to the average player, yet, we need to acknowledge that some games are at their best when players try to figure them out entirely by themselves. Deep, innovative game systems can often be much more interesting if left as a puzzle, and discovering how things work can be a crucial part of the experience. There is also a segment of the population, however small, for whom a certain level of inaccessibility is a big draw. They feel pride in mastering an infamously difficult game, at being in the tiny minority of people who get it. This looks like a very niche approach to game design, one that is rarely fitting in the commercial market, yet it deserves to be recognized.</p><p class="calibre_2">No matter how casual your game is, a degree of mystery and secrecy (a locked door, a seemingly unreachable collectible) can go a long way in driving your players and creating a truly special experience for those who figure things out. Most Super Mario Brothers games are very accessible, yet packed full of secrets and optional areas that require extensive thinking and planning to reach.</p><p class="calibre_2">A good example of a full game following the mystery and mastery paradigm is The Witness, a puzzle game set on an abandoned island, with no tutorial and no guidance except for a few pictographs. The only three elements that make the game work (and work brilliantly well) are:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Positive reinforcement when puzzles are being solved: Things on the island activating, lights turning ON, and so on</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Logic: The puzzles make sense and can be figured out without the need for speech</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Level design and environmental art: The sprawling vistas, different art themes, architecture, and objects (such as closed doors) are crafted in a way that reinforces our natural curiosity</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Localization</p><p class="calibre_2">The term localization was introduced back in <a href="index_split_313.html#filepos716889"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 11</tt></a>, User Interface and User Experience, when we spoke about putting text labels under your UI elements and ensuring they do not break when translated into different languages.</p><p class="calibre_2">In the western markets, the long-dominant practice, and often a requirement posed by the publisher, was to support the EFIGS language group (English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish). Recently, in the more globalized era of digital distribution, the western publishers often find themselves expanding the default group, with Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Russian, and Brazilian Portuguese being the most common additions. The inclusion of new alphabets and directions of text flow is something that can pose big UI challenges for those who are unprepared.</p><p class="calibre_2">Language aside, localization goes above and beyond swapping texts and voiceovers. New markets unlock access to new audiences with different expectations, spending behaviors, pop-culture references, traditions, and cultural sensitivities. Your ultimate goal is to give your players a game that feels like it’s made with them in mind.</p><p class="calibre_2">The best way to approach this is to work with an informed native who can shed light on these differences. Otherwise, a great deal of knowledge can be amassed by observing successful game companies in the sector, looking into local laws that apply to games, and studying the socio-economical situation of your new market.</p><p class="calibre_2">Examples of localization efforts include:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Multi-language websites, forums, and customer support channels.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Tailor-made marketing art and sales messaging.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">A more inclusive character line-up that respectfully represents different races, nationalities, genders, and even sexual preferences.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Replacement or removal of religious and political symbology.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Reducing or replacing gore and blood—often a publishing requirement in Germany.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Different pricing models and/or payment methods. For example, SMS payments are a very popular way of paying for digital goods in India.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">Addition of new characters that appeal to historical or pop-culture references.

In short, playtesting is the process in which you expose your game to the members of your target audience in order to uncover issues and design flaws, and gather actionable feedback that can help improve the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">However, there's more to playtesting than simply having people play your game and tell you what they think. Varying circumstances ask for different methodologies, and knowing how to apply them is essential in obtaining and analyzing results.</p><p class="calibre_2">We’ll now arm you with practical expertise that should help you decide on:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Which parts of the game to test and when?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Who should participate?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">How to run a playtest session?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">How to gather and analyze feedback?</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">What to playtest?</p><p class="calibre_2">Anything that cannot be verified within the confines of your development team is a potential playtesting candidate. A well prepared playtest will be confined to a particular set of questions that your team wants to answer, for example:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Are the controls easy to understand and use?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Do players like and care about their character?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Is this area/mechanic/enemy/puzzle too difficult or too easy?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Are people motivated to keep on playing?</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Such questions and hypothesis are often a part of the production milestone and determine whether the game should continue as is, change its course, or even get canceled.</p><p class="calibre_2">Testing the whole game without focus is rarely a good idea. The broader the spectrum of feedback, the harder it becomes to capture trends and eliminate outlying opinions. Broad spectrum tests are best deployed on groups of people, or even publicly—in the final stages of game’s development.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember, big innovation requires early validation! The riskier the design the more it will benefit from playtesting. Any fundamental building blocks of your game need to be verified as soon as feasibly possible.</p><p class="calibre_2">To help you plan and organize your playtesting sessions, a playtesting plan can be formulated between the producer, designers, lead programmers, and anyone else involved in spearheading the development. Such a plan will surely adapt and evolve with the game, but it’s important to prepare your team for the upcoming times of pre-test intensity and feedback fueled uncertainty.</p><p class="calibre_2">We’ll now deconstruct a sample high-level playtesting plan of a fictional AAA action-adventure game:</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre_117">Pre-production</blockquote></blockquote><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Controls and base game mechanics (movement and camera, jumping and climbing, aiming and shooting, using cover).

Having a test server that anyone can opt to play in allows us to pre-deploy game updates and gather feedback on any changes before they’re made available to the entire playerbase.</p></li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Playtesting formats</p><p class="calibre_2">In the ideal world, you’d be able to repeatedly tap into a strong and consistent flow of players that represent your target audience and have them engage with the entirety of your game in their natural environment. However, due to costs, time, and manpower required for “lab level” user testing, you’ll often have to make sacrifices in either the quality of the players or the extensiveness, robustness, or frequency of the tests.</p><p class="calibre_2">Fortunately, we’re testing entertainment products, not life-saving drugs. Dependable results and useful feedback can be gathered in a variety of ways, some of them available for close to no costs (besides time).</p><p class="calibre_2">Before you create your playtesting plan, you’ll need to acknowledge the advantages and limitations of available solutions, and pick the one that best suits your situation. Playtesting sessions can be divided into three general categories: individual, group, and public.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Individual sessions</p><p class="calibre_2">As the heading suggests, each player is being exposed to the game separately, with their play session closely monitored and often recorded.</p><p class="calibre_2">Individual sessions allow you to pinpoint highly specific usability issues, interview the players and confront their opinions with observed behaviors. They are also good at minimizing peer-based bias as players cannot help out or influence the opinions of fellow test subjects.</p><p class="calibre_2">Frequency is more important than scale. It’s better to run the tests every two weeks on just three users than to do it once a month on a group of ten. Big usability issues are easy to find, and if they’re repeated by more than one player, you have an obvious problem to address.</p><p class="calibre_2">Individual sessions tend to be time-consuming as the facilitator of the test needs to dedicate a portion of their time to each player. As the player pool tends to be smaller, poor screening can also hurt your results. The fewer the players, the more unreliable the findings. Try to grade your testers on a scale based on how closely they overlap with your target demographic and adapt this scale to your findings. For example, a 21 year old male Call of Duty player is not the best source of feedback for a casual game in the hidden object genre, which has a target audience that's primarily female and 34+. Don't just look at the results, but also who is the feedback coming from.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Group playtesting</p><p class="calibre_2">Sometimes the most efficient way of playtesting your game is to put it into the hands of a whole group of people simultaneously.</p><p class="calibre_2">Group sessions are often used on the cusp of big production milestones and may also be the only way to validate certain components such as multiplayer gameplay and balance. It’s a format that allows you to cover more ground, for the price of introducing peer-to-peer bias, missing minor usability problems, and diluting the feedback.</p><p class="calibre_2">The playtesting user group is usually composed of a single cohort, be it company employees, fans and influential community members, recruited testers, press, or friends and family. If possible, try your game on various groups to see how the general opinion differs between them.</p><p class="calibre_2">Supervised playtests have a group of people playing the game at the same time and in the same space. You can run them in your studio or outside, at a conference, exposition show, and so on. Coordinated and supervised tests enable the members of the development team to observe and take notes, but also introduce the risk of peer-to-peer bias. Communication between playtesters can skew the results as they influence each other’s opinions and answer their own questions. Moreover, having multiple people in the same space creates a less critical atmosphere, especially if they’re playing a multiplayer game against their friends and peers.</p><p class="calibre_2">On the other hand, unsupervised playtests have the users access the game at their own leisure (within the testing time frame) and return the results via spoken or written feedback, questionnaires, and analytics. These sessions are easy to run but lower the quantity and quality of findings. They may also not be the best choice for testing onboarding as you cannot directly observe the issues. That said, unsupervised playtests can run for weeks on end, a great choice when gathering feedback on storylines, difficulty and balancing, in-game progression, and metagame.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Public testing</p><p class="calibre_2">Another great way of gathering feedback and testing the game extensively is to release it into the wild, in a limited manner.</p><p class="calibre_2">Public testing most often takes the form of alpha and beta tests, which correspond to their milestones and can either be open (available to everyone) or closed (with access granted to a portion of registered candidates).</p><p class="calibre_2">To make the best use of public tests, you’ll need to open and gather feedback from multiple feedback channels such as:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Game forums, fan pages and community sites such as Reddit.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Questionnaires - either e-mailed via newsletters or linked to from in-game.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Analytics - user retention, equipment usage, win/loss rates, drop off points, and more!</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Built-in rating systems - completed a mission/quest/storyline/challenge? Rate it on a scale or answer yes/no to a sequence of short questions.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Community outreach by moderators and customer support members.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Live-streams - you can engage with the audience and take questions/suggestions directly from them.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Once the game is officially live, you can set up a PTR. This is a test version of the game that allows you to gather feedback on new content and changes before they're made live to the entire player base. PTR can be an invaluable tool for competitive multiplayer games but comes with increased server costs and development effort.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">In the mobile development scene, you also have the practice of soft launching, that is, releasing the game onto a small market (Thailand, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Netherlands, and so on) with the help of locally-targeted marketing. At this stage, it’s also common to run multiple different variants of the game configuration settings in order to find the best performing one. We’ll speak more about A/B testing and analytics in <a href="index_split_443.html#filepos1012825"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 15</tt></a>, Games As a Service.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Remote playtesting solutions</p><p class="calibre_2">In the last several years, professional user testing companies have begun putting more attention on video game development, and premium playtesting services now extend way beyond candidate recruitment. A quick web search will unveil at least several highly-specialized companies capable of running full blown playtests on your behalf.</p><p class="calibre_2">These sessions will either be conducted by specialists in a highly controlled environment, or externalized onto candidates themselves. At the end of the testing period, you'll either be granted access to recordings from on-site sessions or self-recorded testimonials from remote playtesters. Some companies are also willing to combine an expert report that not only highlights the most pressing issues but also suggests potential solutions to your problems.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remote playtesting services are perfect for anyone who lacks the time, people, and expertise to conduct their own tests, but has the money to pay for them. But their utility is not ending there! Remote sessions can be a supplementary source of detailed usability feedback and provide an effective, unbiased control-group for anyone who conducts their own playtesting.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Sourcing candidates</p><p class="calibre_2">People are the single most important resource when running your playtesting sessions. Each group of potential candidates comes with a set of potential advantages and disadvantages. That said, do not get hung up on trying to find the very best people to play your game, it’s often more beneficial to run smaller tests regularly than to find the perfect group of playtesters.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Personal and professional network</p><p class="calibre_2">If you’re working at a games company, using your colleagues as playtesters is one of the most popular practices.</p><p class="calibre_2">Advantages:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Quick and efficient: Sessions are cheap to run and easy to organize.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Inexpensive: There's no agency fees or fixed price per player/hour associated with using your colleagues. That said, be wary of how many man hours are dedicated to your project and get the manager's approval whenever necessary.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Repeatable: It's possible to track changes in test results across multiple versions of the game.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Professional feedback is invaluable: Your colleagues are likely to be full of games knowledge, market insight, and industry expertise. This primes them to share realistic and actionable feedback. They can also help by generating ideas, proposing game mechanics, and giving tips on improving your development process.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Enabling extended play sessions: Using your network opens up the possibility of spending an extensive amount of time with the game and gathering insight into a larger amount of content, the storyline, and the progression systems. It’s still good to observe the onboarding section personally, then set the player free and have them report back after several days. You can then set up another interview and compare the new findings and feedback with the initial performance and opinions of the same tester.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Confidential: There is no need for a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). These are the safest tests you can run.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Disadvantages:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Audience mismatch: It may be impossible to pick users that fit your target audience. Play patterns, age, gender, and interests may differ dramatically.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Lack of objectivity: Many colleagues are less objective and frank with their critique, while others still; are overly pessimistic or have a personal stake in play. The same can be said of your average friend and acquaintance.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Diminishing returns on onboarding: Sessions repeatedly ran on the same person cannot be used to validate your tutorials or first-time user experience. You can only gather objective feedback on your onboarding with help of a fresh pair of eyes.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Feedback stagnation: The more exposure someone has to your project, the harder it becomes to gather fresh and enthusiastic feedback. Repeating the same content for the tenth time is also likely to sprout an unfairly dull and uninspired reaction. They may have nothing new to say but may still feel obliged to find something and try to pick holes in the design.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Developers aren't exactly players: Experience with game development processes gives game dev professionals an unfair insight and skews their perception. If you're looking for an inexperienced player, you're unlikely to find them at a games company.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Your personal and professional network is a hugely valuable playtesting resource that can be tapped into one short notice. Colleagues can provide a fresh pair of professional eyes, valuable critique, and a much-needed boost in confidence. Friends, family members, and acquaintances can be screened easily and are sure to at least partially overlap with your target audience.</p><p class="calibre_2">Spend this resource wisely and avoid over-exposing too many people too early. And remember, your friends and family can be biased towards you and a game industry professional is rarely equivalent to a real player or an average member of your target audience.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Recruited testers</p><p class="calibre_2">Product testing is a big industry! Requesting help from a local agency is a sure way to offload the time-intensive work of finding suitable candidates yourself. Chances are they already have a strong database of potential playtesters you can tap into on short notice.</p><p class="calibre_2">Unfortunately, using agencies to handle player recruitment can get prohibitively expensive. In such cases, you can always try to find testers yourself. Online listings are a couple clicks away and offer a large reach for those who put in the time to manage them. Go to forums, Reddit subgroups, and fansites where your target audience congregates.</p><p class="calibre_2">Advantages:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Handpicked audience: A set of entry requirements makes it much easier to pre-screen and recruit candidates representative of your target audience.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Controlled, unbiased, recorded: With proper training and practice, you'll be able to run tightly controlled sessions that provide you with unbiased feedback and even digital recordings of real reactions to various parts of the game.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Time Efficient: Players can be booked for specific days and time slots. It’s possible to fit multiple tests in a week and have them witnessed by various members of your team—all without unnecessarily disrupting the development schedule.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Ideal for art and FTUE: This is a perfect way of validating your art direction, brand, and First Time User Experience (FTUE) against the members of your target audience.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Confidential: People visiting your studio are more willing to sign and abide by the rules of the NDA than the strangers and fans encountered in the wild.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Disadvantages:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Requires pre-planning: Testers, developers, builds, and devices all need to be scheduled for a specific day and time.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Costly: Even if you avoid the agency costs by recruiting players online yourself, you still need to set aside a monetary reward for each player (typically a small shop voucher).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Limited duration: A recruited player can rarely help you validate long-term progression, retention, storyline, or difficulty. It may be possible to arrange for long or recurring sessions, but doing so will increase the costs and yield diminishing returns.</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Strangers</p><p class="calibre_2">Approaching strangers for help is a seemingly common practice amongst indie developers and university students. This can be done on the street, in a public space, or even at an exposition show or a conference.</p><p class="calibre_2">Advantages:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Mobile friendly: If your project is a mobile title, you can present it to potential players on a moment's notice. Whether you set up a simple stand inside your university building or ask people in the mall to take a look at your prototype, opportunities are abundant.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Inexpensive: The only time you absolutely need to account for is the one spent by the facilitators. Nevertheless, time is money, and you'll increase your chances if you're able to present your candidates with a small shop voucher as an incentive.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Suitable for onboarding: Short tests are perfect for evaluating your tutorials, controls, usability, and the general appeal of the game.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Great for art testing: You don't need a playable version of the game to test the appeal of your brand and the game's art direction. The best way to do that is to present the audience with printouts of several different versions. Have the person pick up their most and least favorite ones and tell you why. Such tests are very reliable and quick to conduct.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Disadvantages:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Hard to scale: Needless to say, there are only so many people you can approach every day and there's a large amount of idle time involved.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Require filtering: It's very hard to screen for suitable candidates and even a short pre or post-test questionnaire may strain the attention span of your candidate, making it harder to determine who exactly the feedback is coming from.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">More effective with a brand: If you're testing in a public environment, the attention span will be very short. In general, the bigger the brand or the monetary incentive, the easier it is to recruit. Finding volunteers to try the new FIFA, Call of Duty, or Star Wars game is much easier than recruiting players for an unknown title from an unknown studio, especially with no monetary award for their time.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Lack of confidentiality: Not many volunteers are keen to read and sign a NDA, and even if they do, you're unlikely to be in a position to properly enforce them.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Limited use for console and PC products: Needless to say, getting strangers to visit your studio and sit down in front of a screen is hard!</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Potential legal roadblocks: Some countries have strict restrictions put on engaging with minors without their parent's written consent. Malls and other quasi-public spaces also have restrictions on what you can and cannot do on their premises without prior authorization.</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Running playtesting sessions</p><p class="calibre_2">We’ll now provide you with a set of guidelines and tips for running your very own playtesting sessions.</p><p class="calibre_2">At first, the methodology may seem unnecessarily complex and restrictive, but the effort you put into preparing and running your sessions has a direct impact on the quality of the results. Do not fret over your mistakes as a test facilitator. After several sessions, it will all become second nature!</p><p class="calibre_2">The playtesting scenarios deconstructed below are two of the most commonly encountered permutations. For any other situation, simply pick and choose to find a combination that fits your playtesters, as well as the available equipment, people, and facilities.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Supervised individual sessions</p><p class="calibre_2">Supervised sessions are best run in a meeting room or another secluded place where you won't be interrupted. The only people present should be the playtester, the test facilitator, and a maximum of two observers. The observers are typically other members of the core development team—everyone should witness at least one test in order to appreciate how their game is performing on an actual player. Instruct the observers to remain quiet and make their presence as unnoticeable as possible.</p><p class="calibre_2">If you have the capabilities, record each session! This will allow you to distribute the footage to everyone interested, and remove the necessity for observers. In the best case scenario, you’d be able to combine raw game footage with a separate video stream of player’s face and body. Seeing the body language of the tester will help you identify their emotional state and better assess their reaction to various parts of the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">If the candidate is under NDA, make sure to prepare one. As soon as they arrive, greet them, offer them a drink and pass an NDA to read and sign. Once they’re all set, the session can commence.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Session introduction</p><p class="calibre_2">If you do not know the playtester, start by introducing yourself and everyone else in the room. It’s good to put distance between yourself and the product. If possible, pretend that you (and everyone else in the room) are not a part of the development team—We’ve been asked by some people at the company to run this tests for them. This setup allows the candidate to open up without fearing they’ll hurt your feelings.</p><p class="calibre_2">After introductions, it's important to explain the purpose of the playtesting session and prime the player to vocalize their emotions and intentions. This is essentially a script, which is being run at the start of each session. In fact, you could write and print it ahead, then read it out to each tester. The script is tailor-made for each game and test-group, but it’s most likely going to include following statements and questions:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">We will present you a work-in-progress version of a game. We’re looking to get your feedback and opinions so that the game can be improved.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">There may be some bugs and unfinished areas, but it's important to get your personal, unfiltered, and honest opinion. If something is terrible, say it's terrible and explain why. Similarly, if you like something, tell us what and why. You cannot hurt our feelings, we are here to learn as much as we can about what works and what doesn't.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">We are here to evaluate the product, not the playtester. You cannot do anything wrong, if something is confusing, it's 100 percent the game's fault.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">When playing the game, try to think aloud and explain what you're doing and why. For example, I think I need to train more troops. I'll need more gold to do that. Maybe if I go on this mission, I'll get more gold.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">It’s good to ask questions. In fact, you should ask all the questions that pop into your head. One small caveat though, we cannot answer the questions immediately. Instead, we'll give you all the answers you want after we're done!</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">If you're testing a branded product, consider some of the following:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">How familiar are you with the brand? <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">At this point, it’s best to present pictures of characters or other branded material and ask for a run-down of what is what. Often players say they are familiar yet cannot pinpoint more than one or two character names.</li></ul></li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">What is your opinion of the brand?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Who do you think the brand appeals to most?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Do you have any expectations for a game based on this brand?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Would you be interested in playing a game in this world?</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Unless you know the tester inside out or are running a pre/post-session questionnaire, it’s important to understand your player's background:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Do you play video games? How often? On what devices? PC, console, mobile?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">What are some of your favorite games?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">What gaming genres are you interested in most?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Are you playing anything now? What is it?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">How much do you spend on games per month?</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Have you ever spent money on downloadable content/in-app purchases? If the answer is YES: What did you spend on? If it's NO: Why not?</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Should you have any artistic tests to conduct (most likely mocked-up screenshots and characters in different themes and styles), present them at this point and get feedback on the following questions:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Which one appeals to the player most? Why?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Which one appeals to the player least? Why?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Who do they think the different styles would appeal to most?</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Playtesting session</p><p class="calibre_2">It’s time to begin the session! For best results, try to adhere to following guidelines:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Provide a comfortable atmosphere: Keep the disturbances to a minimum and do not respond to player's actions and questions; sit back, observe and encourage the player to keep going. Do not loom over the player, sit next to them and respect their personal space.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Encourage the playtester to speak: Provide positive reinforcement when the player speaks (even if they are wrong) and remind them to vocalize their thoughts and reactions if they are overly quiet.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Take notes discreetly: Do not glue yourself to a notepad as players may feel scrutinized and exposed. An exception to this is when players are voicing their opinions and ideas - writing these down can be encouraging. Recording the session helps reduce the reliance on paper notes, and you can always write things down after the session is over.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Do not answer questions: You're not there to help the playtester have a good time or sell them onto your game. Do not answer questions but encourage them to be asked. Find out why they'd like to know and withhold the answers until the session is over.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Prompt players to explain the game to you: This will help compare player's mental model of the game with the reality. Ask for an explanation of every little detail, as if you were their friend who has never seen the game—Tell me what just happened? What do you think this means? How does this work? Who is this character? Be sure to prompt such explanations whenever the user is struggling (to find out what’s wrong in their rationale), as well as at the end of the test (to check if everything aligns and there are no knowledge gaps).</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Ask if they'd keep playing: Every 10 minutes or so, ask the tester if they'd keep playing the game on their own volition. This can help you pinpoint potential drop off points. Find out why they'd be willing to stop/continue playing.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">Avoid leading questions: A question can be loaded with answers or prompt the player to respond in a particular way. "Would you agree that the controls are easy to understand and intuitive?" is not a good way to ask about controls! "What's your opinion on the controls?" is a much better way to formulate a question.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_9">Do not waste time/torture your playtester: You're not learning anything new from someone who's stuck on a single screen for 20 minutes. Write down the point of friction, apologize for the confusion, and explain what has to be done to move on. Explain only as much as you need to keep the test going, and only when the playtester is stuck for good.</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Post-session interview</p><p class="calibre_2">After the playtesting session is over, it's time to ask about tester's overall experience, gather any outstanding feedback, and answer their questions. Consider the following questions:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Would you keep playing this game outside the test? Why?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Would you spend money on this game? Why?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">How would you rate your overall experience? How fun was it on a scale from 1 to 10?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">What’s the most memorable moment? Something that stood out to you.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">What’s the part you enjoyed most? Something you really loved.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">What’s the part you enjoyed least? Something you really hated.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">If you could make changes to this game, what would you change and how?</li><li value="8" class="calibre_9">Who do you think this game would appeal to most?</li><li value="9" class="calibre_9">Any other ideas on how we could improve this game and make it appeal more to players like you?</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">If your game reminded the player of another product:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">How does it compare to that game or other games in that genre?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">What are the biggest differences? What's better and what's worse?</li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">Instead (or in addition to) the interview, you may ask the playtester to fill in a questionnaire. We'll explain the best practices for creating and interpreting playtesting questionnaires in a separate section below.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Unsupervised group playtesting</p><p class="calibre_2">An unsupervised group session requires far less time and involvement per player, but there's still plenty to organize.</p><p class="calibre_2">First up, you need to ensure that each playtester has a suitable device and full access to the specific version of the game. The easiest way out is to have every player use their own PC/Console/Mobile phone, sparing you the need to organize equipment.</p><p class="calibre_2">Make sure to provide detailed instructions on how the game can be obtained and installed. The installing instructions should also explain the intentions behind the test, any areas that require special focus, feedback channels, and any known bugs and issues (in a bid to save everyone's time).</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Setting an objective</p><p class="calibre_2">The success of unsupervised tests depends solely on your players finding the time to try your game and putting in the effort to share their feedback. Unfortunately for us, numbers provide safety. Without direct supervision and time-slots, many playtesters tend to get surprisingly busy with everything but playing the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">To improve the participation, you’ll need to set out a clear, achievable objective for your participants. Try to make the goal rely on time-based progression, not skill. For example: get your character to experience level 10, reach the mountains, finish the first two chapters of the story mode, and so on. This objective will ensure that playtesters engage with the game sufficiently before giving feedback. It also provides a clear way out (excuse) for those who aren’t inclined to put in too much of their personal time.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">Unsupervised group sessions are often used when a game is approaching a significant milestone. If the project has a large scope, it carries a risk of diluting the results. The sheer amount of new game features and content can make for a very long or very chaotic playtest. Players who are set to roam free across a huge game will likely touch upon everything, but rarely provide a deep analysis of any particular area. To help produce more concrete and thorough feedback, you’ll either need to focus the test on a smaller set of areas or features (This playtest is all about Player vs Player combat mechanics and balancing) or divide your playtesters into subgroups. Each subgroup would then be served its own instructions, for example Group A focuses on the story mode, Group B on special abilities, and Group C feeds back on the guilds and social features.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">You can also increase engagement and the quality of feedback by turning the whole thing into a competition and providing the playtesters with extra incentives. For example, each player has a chance to grab a prize in the following categories: the most useful feedback, the best new idea, the highest score on the leaderboard. If you don’t want to hand-pick winners for various categories, you can always run a single prize draw for everyone who submitted their questionnaire in time. As for rewards, if a shop voucher is out of the question, you can always take the winner out for lunch, shower them with their favorite sweets (you can find that out with the questionnaire), or honor them by naming an in-game character, item, or location after them.</p><p class="calibre_2">Objectives and competitions may seem silly at first, but you'll be surprised at how effective they are at promoting test participation and securing high-quality feedback!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Gathering feedback</p><p class="calibre_2">For unsupervised group testing, the typical ways to gather feedback would be:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Face-to-face conversation (make sure to take notes during or immediately after receiving feedback)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Post-session questionnaire</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Electronic communication (work chat, email, and so on)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">In-game feedback forms (vote a map up/down, rate your experience in last round, and so on)</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Analytics (crash reports, win/loss ratios, drop-off points, average frames per second per device, most/least popular and successful loadouts, and so on)</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Playtesting questionnaires</p><p class="calibre_2">Well executed questionnaires are tailor-made to both your game (in its current state) and the playtesting session itself. Sometimes you’ll go for a very short and snappy form, with just a few burning questions to answer, and other times, you’ll try to build the profile of the player and seek feedback on every aspect of the game. Consider the following tips:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Be mindful of the length: The length of your questionnaire should correspond to the length of the test and how much area you've covered. A form with 25 questions may be suitable for a week-long playathon, but not so much for a few short sessions of gameplay focused on the onboarding experience. Playtesting can be fun, filling forms is not.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Build a player profile: Unless your test is very narrow in scope and the playtesters well known, you should dedicate the first few questions to getting to know your player. This information will help you to add more context and validate the feedback. Player profiling comes down to three components: <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Basic info: Name, age, and gender.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Gaming habits: Do they play games on your target platform? How often?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Calibrating against genre and competition: Create a list of similar genres for the playtester to tick, add an open-field at the end for them to add more if they want. Ask what's their favorite game in the genre, ask them to score it. Now that you know who they are and what they play, you can ask them to rate their overall experience in your game on the very same scale. If someone gives their genre showcase a 5/10, and you manage to score a 6, you know that you're faring comparably well in their eyes— perhaps it's not possible for your game to fully satisfy this player, no matter what you do.</li></ul></li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Use basic questions to track progress: Repeating basic questions in each test allows you to make quantifiable comparisons across different tests and milestones. Consider making some of the following your mainstay: <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Rate your overall experience (1-terrible, 10-excellent).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Would you play this game after release (1-not at all, 10-absolutely).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Rate the default control scheme (1-terrible, 10-excellent).</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Rate the user interface (1-very hard to use and understand, 10-very easy to use and understand).</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Rate the difficulty of gameplay challenges (1-way too difficult, 3-just right, 5-way too easy). Due to the nature of difficulty questions, they often need to use a different scale; make sure it's visually distinct! (in this case, it's five bullet points instead of numbers from 1 to 10).</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">How long did you play?/What level did you reach?/What was your high score?</li></ul></li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Avoid leading questions: In here, as in spoken interviews, questions should avoid pointing to an answer. Do you agree that this game is very easy to use? is a loaded question. Rate the difficulty of interaction is a better phrasing, which will make your players consider their experience, as opposed to having them follow the general trend of agreeing to anything they don't have a strong opinion on.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Use 10-point scale: If a question lends itself to a numbered rating, a 1-10 range provides much more accurate results than a 1-5. With a 10-point scale, you can narrow the score to a tidy number, while providing ample room between the middle and the absolute.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Combine questions: If you're asking the same questions about 5 different components, simply combine them into a single, tidy matrix.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">Stay consistent: Do not flip things around! Making a left-to-right scale (where left is bad, right is good) suddenly go in the opposing direction is a surefire way to get false results.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_9">Use digital forms: Do not bother with creating print-out forms that you'll later need to manually gather, input and analyze. Services like SurveyMonkey and Google Forms are free and easy to use. If your playtesters are nearby, you can secure fresh and immediate feedback by giving them access to a tablet with a survey on it. Another cool thing about digital forms, you can embed links to them directly inside the game!</li><li value="9" class="calibre_9">Organize the form: Order your questions in a logical and repeatable fashion. If one question flows into another without dramatically shifting context, the whole form will take less time and effort to fill. Player info comes first, general questions second, test-specific questions are next, and any open-ended questions last. Try to group your questions either by category (story, combat, social features) or context (there are 5 chapters in the game and each gets a series of questions).</li><li value="10" class="calibre_9">Track fill-rate: The larger the test group, the harder it is to get a 100 percent fill rate. Check the fill-rate throughout the test duration and remind the playtesters about the questionnaire. If needed, send individual messages to players that lag behind. Getting a large group of 50 players to a 75 percent fill rate is a big success.</li><li value="11" class="calibre_9">Let the players express themselves: There are three open questions that I try to fit at the end of my forms: <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">What's an in-game moment you LOVED?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">What's an in-game moment you HATED?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Any closing comments, new ideas, things you'd like to see more or less of?</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">The screenshots used in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only.
