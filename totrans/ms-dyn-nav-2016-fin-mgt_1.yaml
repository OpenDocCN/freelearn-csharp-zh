    organizations, the salesperson or the purchase department are the ones responsible
    for generating quotes and orders. People from the finance area are the ones in
    charge of finalizing the sales and purchase processes by issuing the documents
    that have an accountant reflection: invoices and credit memos.'

    to accountancy language, so they needed a financier to do the job. In Dynamics
    NAV, anyone can issue an invoice, with zero accounting knowledge needed. But a
    lot of companies keep their old division of labor between departments. This is
    why we have decided to explain the sales and purchase processes in this book.

- en: An ERP is a system, a piece of software, that integrates the internal and external
    management information across an entire organization. The purpose of an ERP system
    is to facilitate the flow of information between all business functions inside
    the boundaries of the organizations. An ERP system is meant to handle all the
    organization areas on a single software system. This way, the output of an area
    can be used as an input of another area.

    How many customizations can you expect? This is hard to tell as each case is particular,
    but we'll try to give you some highlights.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your ERP system covers 100 percent of your needs without any customization,
    you should worry. This means that your procedures are so standard that there is
    no difference between you and your competence. You are not offering any special
    service to your customer, so they are only going to measure you by the price they
    are getting.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to use Dynamics NAV, all organizations have to use the Financial Management
    area. It is the epicenter of the whole application. Any other area is optional
    and their usage depends on the organization's needs. The sales and the purchase
    areas are also used in almost any Dynamics NAV implementation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actually, accountancy is the epicenter, and the general ledger is included inside
    the Financial Management area. In Dynamics NAV, everything leads to accounting.
    It makes sense as accountancy is the act of recording, classifying, and summarizing,
    in terms of money, the transactions and events that take place in the company.
  prefs: []

    a transfer, these actions can be written in terms of money using accounts, credit,
    and debit amounts.

    one by one to the accounting language. But this means manual duplicate work, a
    lot of chances of getting errors and inconsistencies, and no real-time data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, Dynamics NAV is capable of interpreting such transactions
    and translating them to accountancy on the fly. In Dynamics NAV, everything leads
    to accountancy, so all the company's employees are helping the financial department
    with their job. The financers can now focus on analyzing the data and taking decisions,
    and they don't have to bother on entering the data anymore.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Posted data cannot be modified (or deleted)
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the first things you will face when working with Dynamics NAV is the
    inability to modify what has been posted, whether it's a sales invoice, a shipment
    document, a general ledger entry, or any other data. Any posted document or entry
    is unchangeable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    systems that allow you to modify data. However, this feature is a great advantage
    since it ensures data integrity. You will never find an unbalanced transaction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to null the incorrect ones, and then post the good entries again. For instance,
    if you have posted an invoice, and the prices were wrong, you will have to post
    a credit memo to null the original invoice and then issue a new invoice with the
    correct prices:'

    a track of what was wrong and how we solved it. Users get the feeling that they
    have to perform too many steps to correct the data with the addition that everyone
    can see that there was a mistake at some point. Our experience tells us that users
    tend to pay more attention before they post anything in Dynamics NAV, which leads
    to making fewer mistakes in the first place.
