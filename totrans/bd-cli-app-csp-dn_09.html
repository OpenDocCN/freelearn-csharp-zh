			<h1 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Working with External APIs and Services</h1>
			<p>Although an autonomous application can provide great value to its users, consuming external APIs and services can make it provide even greater value to those users by integrating the functionalities of the application with other applications!</p>
			<p>However, consuming external APIs and services creates new dependencies for your application. While this might make perfect sense, you have to know how to interact with these dependencies and how to integrate them into your application, so you don’t couple your application too much to that external dependency and avoid having to change your application’s code every time that dependency changes.</p>
			<p>More specifically, in this chapter, we will discuss the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The benefits of consuming external APIs</li>
				<li>Extending <strong class="bold">Bookmarkr</strong>’s capabilities by consuming an external API</li>
				<li>The proper way in .NET to consume external APIs</li>
				<li>How to avoid tight coupling between our application’s commands and the external API</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>The code for this chapter can be found in the GitHub repository accompanying this book, <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-CLI-Applications-with-C-Sharp-and-.NET/tree/main/Chapter09">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-CLI-Applications-with-C-Sharp-and-.NET/tree/main/Chapter09</a></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Why consume external APIs?</h1>
			<p>When building your application, you have to consider multiple factors and sometimes implement multiple features that go well beyond your expertise.</p>
			<p>Does that mean you should not build an application if you do not master every feature? No! Many applications rely on code developed by other people who are more skilled and experienced in a very <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>specific area. These pieces of code are packaged as APIs and services so we can use (aka consume) them without having to understand every line of code they contain.</p>
			<p>We have already come across this situation when we added logging into Bookmarkr. We didn’t develop the logging engine ourselves. We instead relied on an existing service provided by an organization that knows how to do it (and do it well!). By relying on that service, our application was able to benefit from logging functionality without having to be experts in the logging business domain.</p>
			<p>Now, I can hear your thoughts (yes, I can – that is my sixth sense 😊). You are thinking that it doesn’t seem that complicated to develop your own logging engine, and you might be right. This is a business decision: if it is part of your core business, then yes, it makes sense to invest time, resources, and money in developing, testing, and maintaining your own logging engine. But remember, while it might be cool to develop it, you will have to maintain it, and that is what hurts many organizations in the long run! You know what they say… You build it, you run it! 😉</p>
			<p>Also keep in mind that building your own “dependencies” (aka, services that are not part of your core business) is not always easy. An example of that is a payment gateway. There is a lot of regulation involved in building and offering such a service. If it’s not your core business (in other words, if you are not Stripe or such a company), don’t do it! Consume an existing service.</p>
			<p>By consuming external APIs and services, we can then focus on what we do best, and in our case, it is managing bookmarks! That is the key to consuming external APIs and services: having the ability to focus on our core business and delegating other concerns to whom those concerns are their core business.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>How to consume an external API</h1>
			<p>.NET provides a way to interact with external APIs and services by abstracting the need to construct our own HTTP requests, handle the underlying networking details, send the request, and receive the response while performing serialization and deserialization and handling communication issues.</p>
			<p>So, in order to interact with these external APIs and services, .NET provides us with the <code>HttpClient</code> class. However, the <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>proper way to deal with this class is through the <code>IHttpClientFactory</code> interface. This allows us to create and manage <code>HttpClient</code> instances for optimal performance and resource management.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Benefits of using IHttpClientFactory</h2>
			<p>Using <code>IHttpClientFactory</code> provides several <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>advantages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>HttpMessageHandler</code> instances, which helps prevent issues such as socket exhaustion</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Connection reuse</strong>: It reuses underlying HTTP connections, improving performance</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resilience</strong>: It adds resilience to transient faults</li>
				<li><code>HttpClient</code> instances</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Bookmarkr: your bookmarks, anywhere!</h1>
			<p>Up to this point, Bookmarkr has been <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>managing our bookmarks locally. This means that we are tied to the physical boundaries of our computer.</p>
			<p>But what happens if we want to access these bookmarks from another computer?</p>
			<p>To make this happen, we will need to extend the capabilities of Bookmarkr beyond the local computer. To do this, we will make Bookmarkr call an external API that will be responsible for storing and retrieving our bookmarks.</p>
			<p>For that matter, we will add a new command called <code>sync</code> that will be responsible for synchronizing the local<a id="_idIndexMarker277"/> bookmarks with the<a id="_idIndexMarker278"/> ones stored by the external service.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">About the external service</p>
			<p class="callout">When you consume <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>an external service, you don’t have to know its internals (aka, its architecture, technology stack, application code, and dependencies). This is in accordance with the encapsulation principle of object-oriented programming.</p>
			<p class="callout">All you need to know is how to send requests to it and how to interpret the responses it returns.</p>
			<p class="callout">However, since I know that you are curious to know more about it, I have provided the details of its architecture and its application and infrastructure code in the <code>appendixA-bookmarkr-syncr</code> branch of the GitHub repository.</p>
			<p>Let’s start by adding the new command!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>The sync command</h1>
			<p>Following the project structure that we<a id="_idIndexMarker280"/> designed in the previous chapter, let’s add a new folder named <code>Sync</code> under the <code>Commands</code> folder, and within this folder, let’s add a new code file named <code>SyncCommand.cs</code>.</p>
			<p>The startup code for this command is the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public class SyncCommand : Command
{
    #region Properties
    private readonly IBookmarkService _service;
    #endregion
    #region Constructor
    public SyncCommand(IBookmarkService service, string name, string? 
    description = null)
        : base(name, description)
    {
        _service = service;
        this.SetHandler(OnSyncCommand);
    }
    #endregion
    #region Options
    #endregion
    #region Handler method
    private async Task OnSyncCommand()
    {
    }
    #endregion
}</pre>			<p>This code is pretty straightforward and needs no explanation.</p>
			<p>The synchronization process comprises the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The local bookmarks<a id="_idIndexMarker281"/> are sent by Bookmarkr’s <code>sync</code> command to the<a id="_idIndexMarker282"/> external service (called BookmarkrSyncr).</li>
				<li>BookmarkrSyncr will then perform the synchronization between the local bookmarks it receives from Bookmarkr with the ones it has in its data store.</li>
				<li>BookmarkrSyncr will send the synchronized bookmarks back to the Bookmarkr <code>sync</code> command’s handler method.</li>
				<li>The <code>sync</code> command’s handler method will store the received bookmarks in the local data store. Keep in mind that if the application is dealing with large datasets or rate-limiting APIs, batching and retry techniques will be needed.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So, the <code>sync</code> command needs to<a id="_idIndexMarker283"/> have a reference to <code>IHttpClientFactory</code>. Let’s add this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
#region Properties
    private readonly IBookmarkService _service;
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
#endregion
#region Constructor
    public SyncCommand(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory, 
    IBookmarkService service, string name, string? description = null)
        : base(name, description)
    {
        _service = service;
        _clientFactory = clientFactory;
        this.SetHandler(OnSyncCommand);
    }
#endregion</pre>			<p>In this code, we are adding a <code>private</code> property of type <code>IHttpClientFactory</code> and we are injecting it through the constructor.</p>
			<p>We are then using it in the command’s method handler:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
#region Handler method
    private async Task OnSyncCommand()
    {
        var retrievedBookmarks = _service.GetAll();
        var serializedRetrievedBookmarks = JsonSerializer.
        Serialize(retrievedBookmarks);
        var content = new StringContent(serializedRetrievedBookmarks, 
        Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
        var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("bookmarkrSyncr");
        var response = await client.PostAsync(«sync», content);
        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            var options = new JsonSerializerOptions
            {
                PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true
            };
            var mergedBookmarks = await JsonSerializer.
            DeserializeAsync&lt;List&lt;Bookmark&gt;&gt;(
                await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync(),
                options
            );
            _service.ClearAll();
            _service.Import(mergedBookmarks!);
            Log.Information("Successfully synced bookmarks");
        }
        else
        {
            switch(response.StatusCode)
            {
                case HttpStatusCode.NotFound:
                    Log.Error("Resource not found"); break;
                case HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized:
                    Log.Error("Unauthorized access"); break;
                default:
                    var error = await response.Content.
                    ReadAsStringAsync();
                    Log.Error($"Failed to sync bookmarks | {error}");
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
#endregion</pre>			<p>This code is pretty easy to understand <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>and conforms to the synchronization process we described earlier.</p>
			<p>There is, however, one segment in that code that requires an explanation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We create an HTTP client from the <code>IHttpClientFactory</code> instance by relying on the named clients approach. As you can see, we are providing the name of the client configuration (here, <code>bookmarkrSyncr</code>) to the <code>CreateClient</code> method. We will get back to this configuration later.</li>
				<li>Next, we issue a <code>POST</code> request to the <code>sync</code> endpoint of the remote web service, passing the list of local bookmarks that have been previously serialized as JSON using an instance of the <code>StringContent</code> class:<ul><li>If the request is <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>successful, we deserialize the returned list of bookmarks (which represents the list of synchronized local and remote bookmarks) and we replace the local list of bookmarks with this new list</li><li>If the request is not successful, we display an error message corresponding to the returned HTTP status code</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In order to import the <code>IHttpClientFactory</code> interface, we need to reference the <code>Microsoft.Extensions.Http</code> NuGet package. As we already know by now, we can do this by typing this command:</p>
			<pre class="console">
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Http</pre>			<p>Before we can use our new command, let’s register it within the <code>Program</code> class!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Registering the sync command</h1>
			<p>Let’s register the <code>sync</code> command <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>in the <code>Program</code> class. It’s only a matter of one line of code:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
rootCommand.AddCommand(new SyncCommand(_clientFactory, _service, "sync", "sync local and remote bookmark stores"));</pre>			<p>But wait! Where did the <code>_clientFactory</code> variable come from?!</p>
			<p>Well done! You spotted it! 😊</p>
			<p>As you may have guessed, this is a reference to the <code>HttpClient</code> that we need to configure to make the magic happen. This is where we will talk about the named clients approach that we mentioned earlier.</p>
			<p>The <code>_clientFactory</code> variable is of type <code>IHttpClientFactory</code>. So, we first need to declare it within the <code>Main</code> method of the <code>Program</code> class:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;</pre>			<p>This will allow us later to retrieve a<a id="_idIndexMarker287"/> reference to it and pass it to the constructor of <code>SyncCommand</code> during its registration (as we saw earlier). We can retrieve that reference as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
_clientFactory = host.Services.GetRequiredService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;();</pre>			<p>Finally, let’s register the HTTP client for the BookmarkrSyncr service. We do this within the <code>ConfigureServices</code> block as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
services.AddHttpClient("bookmarkrSyncr", client =&gt;
{
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://bookmarkrsyncr-api.
    azurewebsites.net");
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Accept", "application/json");
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("User-Agent", "Bookmarkr");
});</pre>			<p>Let’s explain what this code does:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A name (<code>bookmarkrSyncr</code>) is provided for the registered HTTP client. This is why we call this approach “<code>named clients</code>”. Notice that this is the same name that is passed to the <code>CreateClient</code> method in the <code>SyncCommand</code> class we saw earlier. This is how the appropriate HTTP client is selected.</li>
				<li>We then specify the base address for the service and a couple of request headers. Note that the base address does not specify the <code>sync</code> endpoint. It is specified when performing the request. This allows a web service to have different endpoints and for those endpoints to be invoked as needed without having to specify the base address over and over again.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">About the base address</p>
			<p class="callout">You may have noticed that the base address points to an external URL. I deployed the code of the BookmarkrSyncr service in <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>App Service on Azure.</p>
			<p class="callout">I will keep this service up and running as long as I can but keep in mind that you have access to both its infrastructure and application code in the <code>appendixA-bookmarkr-syncr</code> branch if you need to redeploy it.</p>
			<p>Everything is now set up. We<a id="_idIndexMarker289"/> can run the program and see what happens.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Running the program</h1>
			<p>To run the program, we simply <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>need to execute this command:</p>
			<pre class="console">
dotnet run sync</pre>			<p>The result will be as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_09_01.jpg" alt="Figure 9.1 – The sync command in action"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.1 – The sync command in action</p>
			<p>Great, isn’t it?</p>
			<p>If we list all available local bookmarks, we will notice that they have indeed been synchronized with the remote list <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>of bookmarks.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">What about security?</p>
			<p class="callout">You may certainly have noticed that the web service can be used without any authentication. In other words, anonymous requests are allowed, which may be a security concern.</p>
			<p class="callout">You are totally right, and this is intentional for now as security will be addressed in <a href="B22400_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor220"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a> where we will see how we can authenticate users using a technique called “Personal Access Tokens,” which resembles using API keys.</p>
			<p>The code works great but there is actually a drawback to it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Reducing the coupling between our application and the external dependency</h1>
			<p>In the previous section, although we applied the best practices of consuming external APIs, we created a coupling between our application and that dependency…</p>
			<p>Notice that our application actually <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>knows about the data type and structure that is returned by the API. This means that whenever this API changes, we will need to update our code accordingly.</p>
			<p>This also means that our application is responsible for handling the different HTTP codes that the API may return. Can’t we abstract this complexity somewhere so that eventual changes are scoped to a small portion of our code?</p>
			<p>Of course we can! And there is a pattern for that, which is called <strong class="bold">Service Agent</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>About the Service Agent pattern</h2>
			<p>The Service Agent pattern abstracts away the details of HTTP communication into a dedicated service, allowing other services (or, in our case, commands) to interact with external systems without directly <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>dealing with HTTP requests and responses.</p>
			<p>There are many benefits to the Service<a id="_idIndexMarker294"/> Agent pattern, among which are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Abstraction</strong>: It abstracts the complexity of HTTP communication, including constructing the HTTP request, handling the response, and managing errors</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Encapsulation</strong>: It encapsulates all the logic related to communicating with a specific external service or API</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reusability</strong>: Service Agent can be reused by multiple components or services within the application</li>
				<li><code>sync</code> command) from the communication logic (in Service Agent)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Maintainability</strong>: Changes to the external API or communication protocol only need to be made in one place (Service Agent)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I believe that it’s clear to you by now that our CLI application can greatly benefit from leveraging the Service Agent pattern. Let’s now see how we can implement it!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Implementing the Service Agent pattern</h2>
			<p>This pattern is often implemented using <code>IHttpClientFactory</code> and named or typed <code>HttpClient</code> instances.</p>
			<p>We are already using these<a id="_idIndexMarker295"/> artifacts, so it will be quite straightforward for us to abstract the HTTP details away from the <code>sync</code> command and into a dedicated Service Agent class.</p>
			<p>The first step we will perform is to create a folder structure for Service Agents. Following the project structure we have laid out in the previous chapter, let’s create a folder named <code>ServiceAgents</code> and a subfolder named <code>BookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent</code>.</p>
			<p>Within this subfolder, let’s create two code artifacts: an interface file named <code>IBookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent.cs</code>, and a class file named <code>BookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent.cs</code>.</p>
			<p>Here is the code <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>of the <code>IBookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent</code> interface:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
namespace bookmarkr.ServiceAgents;
public interface IBookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent
{
    Task&lt;List&lt;Bookmark&gt;&gt; SyncBookmarks(List&lt;Bookmark&gt; localBookmarks);
}</pre>			<p>This interface only exposes one operation, <code>SyncBookmarks</code>, which takes the list of local bookmarks (held by the Bookmarkr CLI application) and returns the synced list of bookmarks that includes the bookmarks from the remote web service, BookmarkrSyncr.</p>
			<p>Let’s now implement this interface:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
namespace bookmarkr.ServiceAgents;
public class BookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent : IBookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent
{
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
    public BookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent(IHttpClientFactory 
    clientFactory)
    {
        _clientFactory = clientFactory;
    }
    public async Task&lt;List&lt;Bookmark&gt;&gt; Sync(List&lt;Bookmark&gt; localBookmarks)
    {
        var serializedRetrievedBookmarks = JsonSerializer.
        Serialize(localBookmarks);
        var content = new StringContent(serializedRetrievedBookmarks, 
        Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
        var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("bookmarkrSyncr");
        var response = await client.PostAsync(«sync», content);
        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            var options = new JsonSerializerOptions
            {
                PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true
            };
            var mergedBookmarks = await JsonSerializer.
            DeserializeAsync&lt;List&lt;Bookmark&gt;&gt;(
                await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync(),
                options
            );
            return mergedBookmarks!;
        }
        else
        {
            switch(response.StatusCode)
            {
                case HttpStatusCode.NotFound:
                    throw new HttpRequestException($"Resource not 
                    found: {response.StatusCode}");
                case HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized:
                    throw new HttpRequestException($"Unauthorized 
                    access: {response.StatusCode}");
                default:
                    var error = await response.Content.
                    ReadAsStringAsync();
                    throw new HttpRequestException($"Failed to sync 
                    bookmarks: {response.StatusCode} | {error}");
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>			<p>As you may have noticed, this implementation is reusing the code that was located in the body of the <code>Sync</code> command’s handler<a id="_idIndexMarker297"/> method, hence abstracting it from this method and encapsulating it into the Service Agent class.</p>
			<p>For this reason, the code of this class does not need a lot of explanation. However, it is worth mentioning that in case of an unsuccessful request, we return an instance of <code>HttpRequestException</code> with the details about the issue.</p>
			<p>Next, we need to update the code <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>of the <code>SyncCommand</code> class to abstract the use of <code>IHttpClientFactory</code> and use our new Service Agent instead. The updated code is the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public class SyncCommand : Command
{
    #region Properties
    private readonly IBookmarkService _service;
    private readonly IBookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent _serviceAgent;
    #endregion
    #region Constructor
    public SyncCommand(IBookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent serviceAgent, 
    IBookmarkService service, string name, string? description = null)
        : base(name, description)
    {
        _service = service;
        _serviceAgent = serviceAgent;
        this.SetHandler(OnSyncCommand);
    }
    #endregion
    #region Options
    #endregion
    #region Handler method
    private async Task OnSyncCommand()
    {
        var retrievedBookmarks = _service.GetAll();
        try
        {
            var mergedBookmarks = await _serviceAgent.
            Sync(retrievedBookmarks);
            _service.ClearAll();
            _service.Import(mergedBookmarks!);
            Log.Information("Successfully synced bookmarks");
        }
        catch(HttpRequestException ex)
        {
            Log.Error(ex.Message);
        }
    }
    #endregion
}</pre>			<p>This code is quite simple and easy to read. What we did basically was replace the use of <code>IHttpClientFactory</code> with the use of <code>IBookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent</code> and remove all the code, in the <code>OnSyncCommand</code> method, that was dealing with the HTTP communication (which we abstracted away into the Service Agent class) by the call to the <code>Sync</code> method of the Service <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>Agent. Hence, the <code>OnSyncCommand</code> method is also leaner, shrinking from 41 lines of code down to 16.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">For your reference, we provide a copy of the <code>SyncCommand</code> class as it was before introducing the use of the Service Agent class. By doing so, you can easily compare the differences between the two implementations. Look for the file named <code>SyncCommand_NoServiceAgent.txt</code> in the <code>Commands/Sync</code> folder.</p>
			<p>The final step is to register the Service Agent into the list of services in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> section of the <code>Program</code> class.</p>
			<p>As we have seen previously, this can be easily done by adding this line of code:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
services.AddScoped&lt;IBookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent, BookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent&gt;();</pre>			<p>We need not forget to declare a variable for the Service Agent:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
IBookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent _serviceAgent;</pre>			<p>Next, we need to retrieve the instance of that Service Agent:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
_serviceAgent = host.Services.GetRequiredService&lt;IBookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent&gt;();</pre>			<p>We pass it to the constructor of the <code>SyncCommand</code> class:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
rootCommand.AddCommand(new SyncCommand(_serviceAgent, _service, "sync", "sync local and remote bookmark stores"));</pre>			<p>Everything is now in place. Let’s make sure that the application still works as expected.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Rerunning the program</h2>
			<p>We can run the program the same<a id="_idIndexMarker300"/> way we did before, by typing this command:</p>
			<pre class="console">
dotnet run sync</pre>			<p>We will get the exact same result, proving that the application still works as it is supposed to:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_09_02.jpg" alt="Figure 9.2 – The sync command in action using the Service Agent"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.2 – The sync command in action using the Service Agent</p>
			<p>Awesome! By leveraging the Service Agent pattern, we have been able to provide a clean separation between the business logic and the details of HTTP communication. Hence, we can consume the BookmarkrSyncr web service in any other command (using the <code>BookmarkrSyncrServiceAgent</code> class), without this command having to deal with the HTTP communication details.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned how to extend the functionalities of Bookmarkr by consuming external APIs and services.</p>
			<p>We explored the best practices of communicating with external dependencies, handling response data, codes, and errors, and designing that integration in a way that does not create a heavy coupling between the external dependency and our application, making it easy to replace that dependency over time if this proves necessary.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will cover one of the key aspects of building applications, which is testing those applications.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Your turn!</h1>
			<p>Following along with the provided code is a great way to learn through practice.</p>
			<p>A better way is by challenging yourself to achieve tasks. Hence, I challenge you to improve the Bookmarkr application by adding the following features.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Task #1 – adding SQLite as a data store</h2>
			<p>Who said that APIs are the only external dependencies an application can rely on? Certainly not me! 😊</p>
			<p>Until now, our application has stored its bookmarks in memory. You will certainly agree with me that this is not an ideal solution as bookmarks will be lost as soon as the application terminates or restarts.</p>
			<p>You are asked to add a new dependency to the Bookmarkr application – a <strong class="bold">SQLite</strong> database! This will allow bookmarks to be <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>stored in a more permanent manner by Bookmarkr, making it more useful to our users 😉.</p>
			<p>Why SQLite? You may ask…</p>
			<p>SQLite is a versatile and lightweight database solution, designed to be both simple and easy to use while requiring minimal setup and administration. One of its most significant advantages is its portability: the entire database is stored in a single file, which makes it easy to move, back up, and distribute. Its self-contained nature also means that SQLite doesn’t require a separate server process or system configuration, simplifying its deployment. That is why it is a great fit for CLI applications!</p>
			<p>Now, you will also need to modify the code of <code>BookmarkService</code> to retrieve bookmarks from and store bookmarks in the SQLite database.</p>
			<p>Consider using the <code>Microsoft.Data.Sqlite</code> library for .NET, as it is a reliable and lightweight library. Consider adding migrations and ensuring thread-safe access for SQLite in concurrent CLI scenarios.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Task #2 – retrieving the web page name based on its URL</h2>
			<p>Until now, when adding a new bookmark, we had to pass both the web page name and URL.</p>
			<p>Now that we know how to work with external dependencies, let’s tweak the <code>link add</code> command so that it makes an HTTP request to retrieve the name of the web page to bookmark based on the provided URL. If the name can’t be retrieved, we can then use the name that was passed as a command option.</p>
			<p>If the web page cannot be found, the bookmark’s name should be <code>Unnamed bookmark</code>. If the request takes more than 30 seconds, terminate it and also set the name to <code>Unnamed bookmark</code>.</p>
