Would you be able to write a two-to-five pages short presentation on that game? A presentation that describes why is it fun, how you play it, what it looks like, and for what kind of player it is going to be a great experience?</p><p class="calibre_2">Now imagine that you've never played that game, that it doesn't even exist yet. Would you still be able to describe it?</p><p class="calibre_2">That vision is the game you want to make and the presentation is a game concept.</p><p class="calibre_2">The purpose of the game concept is to describe a game with enough detail <span class="italic">to distill and communicate its vision</span> to the reader. To explain what makes it fun, who'll enjoy playing it, and why we should make it a reality.</p><p class="calibre_2">One of the main responsibilities of every game designer is to make sure that, at every stage of development, the vision behind the game is clearly documented and communicated to the team.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">The earlier you are in the development cycle, the more abstract this documentation will be.

You will be able to compare your initial work with what we're going to see, expand it, and find and correct any eventual mistake by yourself.</p><p class="calibre_2">Structure of a game concept document So, how do you write a game concept? And what do you need before starting?</p><p class="calibre_2">There is some information that any game concept should always contain:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Introduction (sometimes called a <span class="italic">hook</span> or <span class="italic">elevator pitch</span>)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Description/game overview</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">A list of key features, including its <span class="bold">Unique Selling Points</span> (<span class="bold">USPs</span>)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Game genre</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Platform</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Target audience</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">It is clear from this list that your role as a game designer is not about deciding all this. The game idea or hook may come from any other team member, from an external client, from a publisher, or from some lead/director within the company.</p><p class="calibre_2">The games industry offers a lot of freedom and possibilities; there are companies that make games to make a profit or indie developers that follow their passion and make their games because they have something to say—there are even people working on games in their free time just because they love it.</p><p class="calibre_2">Regardless of the motivations or the goals of a developer, it's always a good idea to treat a game such as a commercial product. This means that, in order to justify the existence of the game, there must be people willing to buy it, play it, and hopefully even talk about it. This is why the game concept needs to go beyond a simple description of a game; you have to think about a game concept as a sales tool.</p><p class="calibre_2">The audience may vary (and so do the formality and the structure of the document) but the goal stays the same: whoever reads the document must understand and see what the development team wants to do, and needs to get excited about that!</p><p class="calibre_2">The reader might be a publisher to which you are presenting the idea. Presenting really means selling, in this case. But the reader could be the programmer who is going to implement the game or an artist who is going to create all the artwork or graphical assets, or even just a possible player. All these people will look at the document in a different way, but one thing is for sure: if they get what the document is trying to present they will get excited about the project and look forward to whatever it is they have an interest in, from giving the money needed for its development, to working on it or to just playing it!</p><blockquote class="calibre_112"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></tt></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Try to compare the work you have done in your first exercise with what you have learned in this paragraph. Does your concept include information such as genre, platform, or target audience?</tt></span></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Read on to understand what are we talking about and why these things are as important as the mere description of the game.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_97"/>


<div id="filepos158135" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The "hook" or "elevator pitch"</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">You have a couple of sentences, three maximum, to describe what your game is going to be. The introduction has to condense all the information that you will expand in the rest of the document. This is your first page and if it doesn't catch your reader's attention, nothing else you have to say will.</p><p class="calibre_2">It's not only that; by stripping your whole game down to such a fundamental description, you are focusing on what's really important. It's like a mantra you will have to follow during development because that's your promise to your players.</p><p class="calibre_2">It's called <span class="italic">a hook</span> because the reader wants to know more. Some call it an e<span class="italic">levator pitch</span> because it's what you can say to a stranger in a 30-second elevator ride. A great example comes from a well-known game developer, Rami Ismail. He and his team, Vlambeer, made a game called <span class="italic">Ridiculous Fishing</span>, a hit mobile game from 2013.</p><p class="calibre_2">What is it? In his own words, it's <span class="italic">Fishing with machine guns</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">In just four words, this sentence tells a lot about the game, but also makes you wonder <span class="italic">how?</span> (and probably <span class="italic">why?</span>). You're hooked. You want to know more. Great introduction!</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">There are no strict rules on how to put together your introduction. In a multimedia world, some games are introduced with a short video, a set of mood boards, or concept art. These are all powerful tools that can be used to communicate the game vision. Don't limit yourself to just words on a page; after all, a picture is worth a thousand words. At the same time, keep in mind your audience, be sure that the person who is going to read your concept can clearly understand your intentions. As your audience changes (from peers to high-level executives), you might need to change things around and adapt your concept.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_99"/>


<div id="filepos160417" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Description</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">In a few paragraphs, a page, or a few slides, this is where the game is described. All the main elements should appear in this section:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">The core gameplay mechanics</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">The narrative</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Mode and setting</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Information about the characters and the game world</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">The idea is to give to the reader a clear picture of how the final experience is going to be. This is also the section with more space for multimedia. Concept artwork can juxtapose text to reinforce it, but also to give directions about the art style.</p><p class="calibre_2">Sometimes audio and soundtracks will be a defining part of a game concept (just think about musical games), and for games that would require an extensive use of audio, such as narrative games with voice acting, including these details early in the concept is as important as defining the core gameplay mechanics.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">A common mistake while writing the description is to include too specific information or yield to the temptation of exaggerating. Describing the game combat as driven by a revolutionary artificial intelligence is not a good idea if developing that AI is not part of the plan (or the budget). And in case it is, there's no need to go into the details of how such an AI will work, even though a few words to describe why it's defined as revolutionary might be required.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_101"/>


<div id="filepos162326" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Key feature set</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">This is a list of the features that make your game a great experience for your players. There's no need to include all the system you will be designing, but it is expected that a game concept includes all the main ones. This means that a healthy development cycle starts with a fundamental feature set that remains largely unchanged (unless things don't work out as expected and you find yourself in dire need of a big design pivot).</p><p class="calibre_2">Some common key features are game modes, multiplayer guild systems, battle systems, playable characters, progression systems, and technical features (such as advanced AI or particular graphics). The list is as long as a designer's imagination can go, so make sure to include only the ones really relevant to your game.</p><p class="calibre_2">To look at some practical examples, the App Store gives some very good insights. Most App Store descriptions contain a list of the game's key features. <span class="italic">Hearthstone</span>, for example, markets itself with the following messages:</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">JUMP RIGHT IN: Fun introductory missions bring you into the world of Hearthstone's intuitive gameplay.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">BUILD YOUR DECK: With hundreds of additional cards to win and craft - your collection grows with you.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">HONE YOUR SKILLS: Play in practice matches against computer-controlled heroes of the Warcraft universe. Thrall, Uther, Gul'dan - they're all here!</span></span></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">COLLECTION TRAVELS WITH YOU: Your card collection is linked to your Battle.net account - enabling you to switch your play between tablet and desktop with ease.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">AND FIGHT FOR GLORY: When you're ready, step into the Arena and duel other players for the chance to win awesome prizes!</span></span><br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="calibre_2">As you can see, Blizzard did an excellent job of mixing technical and gameplay features, describing them with taglines that make players excited about their trading card game. These messages were obviously written by the marketing team for the finished product, but they are a perfect example of clearly and efficiently communicating the key feature set to the target audience.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_103"/>


<div id="filepos164960" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Finding your USP</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">What makes your game different? What is its USP?</p><p class="calibre_2">Finding the USP is a fundamental step in defining your key feature set, especially if your concept is intended for a publisher or an investor.</p><p class="calibre_2">The USP determines that unique mechanism or takes on your genre that are going to make your game stand out from the competition, the reason why players out there will be interested in dedicating their valuable time to your game instead of the many others that they already have or are interested in trying.</p><p class="calibre_2">To help you understand the idea behind the USP, sometimes also called <span class="italic">breakthrough</span>, let's have a look at some widely popular and successful games. The <span class="italic">Assassin's Creed</span> franchise came out in 2007 and it revolutionized the action-adventure game genre by introducing its famous <span class="italic">parkour</span> mechanic. The ability to traverse on the vertical axis by freely climbing buildings was a fresh and innovative feature and helped set the game apart from its competition. The public response was immensely positive, and despite some major flaws in that original game, Assassin's Creed became one of the biggest game franchises in history.</p><p class="calibre_2">Another famous example, on a different platform: <span class="italic">Supercell's Clash Royale</span>. The core gameplay is based on collecting cards and battling with them in an arena with other players. The game is full of fresh takes on different mechanics, but it has one very clear USP: real-time <span class="bold">Player vs Player</span> (<span class="bold">PvP</span>). When the game came out in mid-2016, very few mobile games were relying on synchronous PvP. Most titles at the time were either turn-based or real-time vs AI (the other player being controlled by an artificial intelligence). Clearly, it was a consequence of the technical challenges of creating synchronous PvP games on mobile.</p><p class="calibre_2">Like in any market, an unexplored area is both a risk and an opportunity. <span class="italic">Supercell</span> was successful in pushing the boundaries of mobile multiplayer games towards synchronous PVP and created a billion-dollar game in the process.</p><p class="calibre_2">The USP concept seems to be another one more concerning marketing and sales. Indeed, the two questions: <span class="italic">Why should I buy your game?</span> and <span class="italic">Why should I play your game?</span> have very similar answers, but as a game designer, your job is to answer the latter. However, most of the time, that will answer the former too!</p><blockquote class="calibre_112"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></tt></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Have you clearly defined the USP for your game concept? Try to add it to your document.</tt></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Is it unique enough to make the concept stand out from similar games? </tt></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Do you know any other examples of game franchises that owe their popularity to a specific USP? Think about a few of them and compare their USP with yours.</tt></span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_105"/>


<div id="filepos168354" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Platform</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">This refers to the hardware on which the game will be played or a particular distribution platform. Hardware such as PCs, games consoles, mobile devices, and virtual reality headsets are considered <span class="italic">platforms</span>, but also specific environments such as Facebook or iMessage are platforms themselves. Each platform brings a unique set of requirements and opens up very different possibilities, both on the technical and creative sides.</p><p class="calibre_2">Choosing the right platform for your game has to be one of the earliest decisions. The platform on its own can have an immense influence on the game design, from the target audience and business model to controls, user interface, and performance requirements. Platform choice in itself sets certain expectations towards the game you're making. There's a good reason why match-three puzzle games are not swarming the console market.</p><p class="calibre_2">From an audience perspective, a card solitaire game may work really well on smartphones but is unlikely to be as popular on consoles. Similarly, but from a hardware angle, a strategy game that relies on precise controls provided by mouse and keyboard might not translate very well to the console or handheld input methods.</p><p class="calibre_2">There are many unspoken rules to game design, and knowing when to break them is part of the art. Introducing a complex strategy game to the smartphone market and tackling the challenges of the platform head-on might result in a very innovative and interesting product. But remember, such experiments are risky, so make sure you know the rules before you try to break them!</p><p class="calibre_2">Each platform has also a very tangible impact on how the game will be designed. The most evident example is about input controls: an action game would pose completely different challenges on a mobile device than on a console controller...</p><p class="calibre_2">Those difference in design are not limited to the platform technology; the way the player expects to interact with games on different platforms is important too. A mobile game would be usually characterized by short sessions where the player is able to complete the whole game loop in just a few minutes, while a PC game could require the same amount of time just to go through a single cutscene.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_107"/>


<div id="filepos170968" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Audience</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">There is a huge difference between an educational game for little kids and an 18+ rated zombie shooter.</p><p class="calibre_2">Defining the audience is part of the initial creative process. Even if it seems such as a consequence of the kind of game one wants to make, it is important to spend some time thinking about it and having a clear idea of who is going to play the game. The kids/adult example is an easy one, but identifying an audience means asking yourself questions such as who is interested in this game? Which other similar games does he or she play? What are they expecting from a new game in their favorite genre?</p><p class="calibre_2">Mere demographics are still an important factor in defining an audience, but in our modern world, amazingly, pretty much everyone plays video games and there's no such thing as a <span class="italic">young hardcore gamer</span> or an <span class="italic">average casual gamer</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">These are concepts from the past that it is important to leave behind. Everyone is a potential gamer in today's world, but each and every gamer is interested in very different game experiences. Internet and online communities give game developers an incredible tool to find out about people's desires and fantasies in terms of what they'd love to play. User research is done by many developers, submitting rough concepts, trailers, or marketing materials of games that don't yet exist to test and learn from those desires.</p><p class="calibre_2">Video game audiences are also constantly evolving. There is a great article written by Meg Jayanth (the writer behind 80 Days) for The Guardian in 2014 titled:</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">"52% of gamers are women – but the industry doesn't know it".</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">(<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/52-percent-people-playing-Games-women-industry-doesnt-know"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/52-percent-people-playing-games-women-industry-doesnt-know</tt></span></a>). Give it a good read! Industry reports available online can also give you a great idea of the different (and, sometimes, unexpected) types of audience out there.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">When you define your target audience, try to go beyond a generic definition. Define your audience by their interests.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> Casual players who have a few spare minutes on their commute is incredibly more accurate than an average casual gamer.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> Hardcore players who grew up playing strategy games such as Dune II and Fallout Tactics are not quite the same as hardcore strategy game players.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> A more precise target audience definition is extremely helpful because it gives you something to design around already. Just look at the information contained in casual players who have a few spare minutes on their commute. You don't only know that your game is for casual players, you also know that the average game session should last no more than a few minutes and that the game might have some problems working online, as commuting usually means unstable mobile networks.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_109"/>


<div id="filepos174574" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Age rating systems</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">You surely have heard about PEGI or ESRB. Age-based rating systems are important in the game industry and they should be taken into consideration by developers. Knowing beforehand that you are developing a game that is supposed to be PEGI 7, for example, already says a lot about the game design itself. <br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="calibre_2">The same goes for mature-rated games.</p><p class="calibre_2">Sometimes, the very fact that they are mature-rated is part of the concept.</p><p class="calibre_2">In fact, the idea of including an <span class="italic">expected</span> age-based rating in the concept might help in creating a game actually suitable for that age restriction.</p><p class="calibre_2">There is an everlasting debate about these systems and how they are (or are not) useful to consumers, especially parents choosing a game for their children. As will often be the case in this book, we strongly recommend you explore the topic on your own; but for now, keep in mind that they are not just tools to rate a finished game, but also useful guidelines to keep a project on track so it's suitable for a particular audience.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_111"/>

Therefore, in games, the <span class="italic">genre is more informative than the theme and the setting</span>. And so our genres, such as a <span class="bold">First Person Shooter</span>
<span class="italic">(</span><span class="bold">FPS</span><span class="italic">),</span> are heavily related to the gameplay at hand. An FPS can take place in different settings and explore different themes: from historic, to present day or even sci-fi.</p><p class="calibre_2">Genre tells the players what kind of game they will be playing, and it's a very useful way to classify games. There are quite a lot of genres and each genre might have many sub-genres. Also, smart game designers are constantly redefining genres and pushing the boundaries of what a genre means. Nonetheless, it is safe to say that some genres are universally recognized by both developers and players as standard.</p><p class="calibre_2">Some examples are FPS, platformers, <span class="bold">role-playing games</span> (<span class="bold">RPG</span>), sports games, <span class="bold">mass multiplayer online games</span> (<span class="bold">MMO</span>), <span class="bold">Multiplayer online battle arenas</span> (<span class="bold">MOBA</span>), strategy games, and simulations. The list goes on and on.</p><p class="calibre_2">Defining the genre, or having a genre as a starting point for redefining one, is a crucial part of creating a game concept, certainly the one that will most influence the entire design process:</p><blockquote class="calibre_112"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></tt></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">How many genres are you familiar with? Make a list of all the genres you know and then highlight the ones you have never played. Get yourself some games in those genres and familiarize yourself with them. Everyone has their favorite genre, but by becoming a game designer, you can't afford to ignore the genres you don't like to play. You are not a mere videogamer anymore!</tt></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Have a look at this great list on Wikipedia and keep learning about old games and genres you might have missed! </tt></span><br class="calibre1"/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_Game_genres"><span class="calibre4"><tt class="calibre5">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_genres</tt></span></a></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_113"/>

Remember, a game is ultimately a product that needs to be sold, even the most artistic one—surprisingly enough, even the ones that will be given away for free. As we already mentioned, a game concept is not a one-man job by the game designer. Just like game design, creating a game concept is a collaborative work in which the whole team participates and there might be also requirements coming from outside. This includes the business model, and the team needs to have a clear idea of how it will work.</p><p class="calibre_2">You might think that this is something about marketing that doesn't really concern you, but the business model will have an impact on how the game is designed; therefore, it is absolutely your concern and has to be clear from the beginning.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Some developers think that business models are some kind of virus that infected the game development world in recent years.

Or maybe, that smaller games made by a handful of developers don't need to waste time on marketing stuff.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> Sometimes, indeed, this is true, especially because there are many reasons to make a game with no intention of selling it.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> That said though, the rest of the time (which is most of the time) games have to be sold and the job of the game developer is to make games for a living. So keep the business model in mind, and design around it from the beginning. Create something so great that players are willing to pay for it.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">There are three main business models through which a game can generate revenue:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Premium</span>: A premium game is paid upfront and then it can be played virtually forever by the player. It is still the dominant business model for console and PC games. Some examples include <span class="italic">The Elder Scroll V</span>: <span class="italic">Skyrim</span>, <span class="italic">The Sims,</span> and <span class="italic">The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span>.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Subscription</span>: Games with subscriptions require the player to pay a monthly fee in order to continue to access the game. The most popular subscription-based games are MMOs such as <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span> or <span class="italic">Eve Online.</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Free to Play</span>: <span class="bold">Free to Play</span> (<span class="bold">F2P</span>) games can be downloaded and played for free and rely entirely on optional microtransactions. Extensive information on this business model can be found later on, in <a href="index_split_443.html#filepos1012825"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 15</tt></span></a>, G<span class="italic">ames As a Service.</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Sounds simple enough, right? Like every aspect of game development, there's a whole lot under the surface! Each of those three main models can be implemented in a variety of different ways and also intertwined with each other.</p><p class="calibre_2">Premium games can be given out for free as a demo (only a limited amount of content available for free) or for a limited amount of time (free weekends are really popular for competitive multiplayer games such as Overwatch). Premium games can also be enriched with further content releases of <span class="bold">downloadable content</span> (<span class="bold">DLC</span>). This is new and fresh content (levels, characters, game modes, and so forth) made available later to keep players interested and engaged in a game. Usually, DLC is sold for extra money, but sometimes it might be free (for everyone or just for players who purchased a particular edition of the game).</p><p class="calibre_2">A great example of an innovative business model is Episodic games, popularized by <span class="italic">Telltale games</span>, with their series of licensed titles such as <span class="italic">The Walking Dead</span> and <span class="italic">Back to the Future</span>. This is essentially an evolution of the old shareware (demo) or trial model but naturally divided and reinforced by the narrative. Usually, the first episode is given away for free, and the player can decide to purchase each additional episode individually or <span class="italic">subscribe</span> and gain access to the entire season.</p><p class="calibre_2">F2P games can generate their revenues in even more creative and new ways. Offering virtual goods or in-game currencies for real money is just one possibility. F2P games can make money through advertisements (yes, just like TV shows!) and then sell players the ad-free version, or they can ask players to watch an ad to get an in-game reward, or maybe to subscribe to the game to get the same reward without having to watch any ads.</p><p class="calibre_2">There are many possibilities, but regardless of the business model you chose for your game, one thing must not be forgotten: the business model and the game design are intertwined.</p><p class="calibre_2">Creating a game and thinking about its business model as the last step before release is a huge mistake. Switching between vastly different business models in the middle of the development process (for example, turning a premium game into an F2P one) is a very dangerous move that can seriously derail the product. This is why the business model is an essential part of the game concept. Like anything else in it, it sets important guidelines for the entire development:</p><blockquote class="calibre_112"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></tt></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Did your initial concept include something about the business model? </tt></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Think about it and include it in your concept. Does it change your idea of the game? What are players going to pay for? </tt></span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_115"/>


<div id="filepos185063" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Know your competition</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">There is another reason why a game concept is such an important milestone in starting to create a new game. Once your game genre, audience, and platform are defined, it is possible to take a look at what's out there in the market: your competition. Understanding games similar to the one you will be developing is crucial to the project's success. It is very likely that the developers of those other games have already faced and solved (or maybe not!) many of the problems you will encounter at some point during development.</p><p class="calibre_2">Communities of players already playing those games might be discussing them in depth online. This is an invaluable resource for you, as you will be able to fix known problems or add features to your game, based on what real players are willing and hoping to play.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Other ways of gaining insight into the competition include game postmortems (first-hand reports on what went right and wrong on a particular game project), user research, analytics, and industry press.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Your competition also defines the state of your game's genre, giving you a clear direction regarding your design. Once you have analyzed your competition, you can ask yourself questions such as:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="italic">Is my game too similar to what's already out there?</span></li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="italic">How is it different?</span></li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="italic">Does it offer a better and novel experience to its target audience?</span></li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="italic">If I was a fan of my competitor's game, would I be interested in trying out this new game?</span></li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Answering these questions honestly will help you establish and test your USPs.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_117"/>


<div id="filepos187273" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The ideation process</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We have already explored defining and communicating game ideas to others through the game concept document, now let's pose a more fundamental question. How do we generate the game idea in the first place? How do we get to the point of having something to write down in the concept document?</p><p class="calibre_2">Before we begin, let's make it clear that the game designer is not the <span class="italic">ideas guy</span>. It is not their job to have a constant flow of new game ideas. These can (and should) come from anyone in the company or even from people outside your organization. It's very common in our industry to have publishers <span class="italic">commission</span> a game idea to the developers, an owner of an <span class="bold">intellectual property</span> (<span class="bold">IP</span>) such as <span class="italic">Star Wars</span> or <span class="italic">The Witcher</span> to seek out licensing, or game studios themselves providing outsourcing services to other developers.</p><p class="calibre_2">A game idea could be driven by market research, a game vision, or even, in a more artistic way, by the urge to say something or tell a story. What is really important for you as a game designer is to have what I like to call the <span class="italic">designer mindset</span>. The designer mindset allows you to process raw ideas analytically. You should be able to imagine a finished product being played by your audience. You will need to predict any major problems and issues, have a clear idea of the competition, and some intuition about possible USPs.</p><p class="calibre_2">There are no shortcuts to developing this mindset; you have to play games and create them, to know what works and what doesn't, to keep a critical eye on everything you play and see. Ideally, you will strive to become a true expert in the genres you are more interested in (both as a designer and as a player), but to do so, you'll often need to explore all sorts of games. You might not be keen to play certain types of game, but you must still try and understand what makes them fun for their intended audience. A truly great designer will be able to point out good and bad design decisions in anything from a pony nurturing game to a horror shooter.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Every developer (not just game designers) dreams of working on their dream game, but as a professional who's trying to make a living, you will have to adapt your skills and career goals to what's required of you. Shift your expectations to the available opportunities and embrace the challenge of working on something that isn't your forte. Your job will rarely allow you to create a perfect representation of your dream game; until that time arrives, be resourceful and make the best possible game, treating your constraints as interesting problems rather than depressing limitations. Learn from your mistakes and do the best you can for the players and the team!</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">The designer mindset and the game designer profession are something you develop with experience and dedication. Like any other discipline, you will need to study and work hard.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_119"/>


<div id="filepos190663" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Coming up with ideas</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">As we said, ideas can come from many different sources, so let's try to recap them in a practical list of activities that can help you come up with interesting concepts for future new games:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Play tons of video games, especially ones outside your favorite genres</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Watch movies, TV, and theatre, and read books</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Travel</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Think how to turn your interests outside gaming into a game (bricolage, wine, fitness, art, music, traveling, and so on)</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Analyze the market and think about unique games that are not quite there</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Ask other people what they'd like to play that is not quite there</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">Deconstruct your favorite games, focusing on what would make them better</li><li value="8" class="calibre_9">Go to game jams where you'll have a very restricted amount of time to create a game around a given theme</li><li value="9" class="calibre_9">Give yourself a theme and try to make a game around that in a very short time</li><li value="10" class="calibre_9">Learn the basics of a game engine and do some stuff! Anything: follow online tutorials, try to recreate some game mechanics, just mess around with example projects</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_121"/>


<div id="filepos192339" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Twisting familiar mechanics</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">As a game developer, your goal will always be to create new interesting games, but as we can learn from other game developers' success stories, a successful game is always a mix of novelty and familiarity. If you think about most of the games available today, you can clearly see how each of them is an iteration of an older game or well know mechanics. Very few games are completely new and with <span class="italic">never-seen-before</span> core mechanics.</p><p class="calibre_2">In fact, your role as a game designer is not to invent a completely new set of mechanics every time, but to pick a set that works well with the game you're making. Using existing mechanics, refining well-known concepts, and falling back on clichéd settings is totally fine (if you think about it, many multimillion dollars franchises do exactly that). Just make sure that you have a very clear goal of what you want to achieve and how the mechanics you picked are helping you deliver on your vision.</p><p class="calibre_2">Don't be afraid, there will be plenty of space for innovation and creativity even working on proven mechanics. More importantly, there will be plenty of occasions to work on truly innovative games in your career. Just keep in mind that, as a professional game designer, your goal is to design compelling game experiences and not to do something new and different at all costs.</p><p class="calibre_2">It must be clear at this point that everything that goes into the game concept will have a direct impact on how the game is going to be designed. This is why it is so important that it is defined as a first stage and must be kept in mind for the whole development process.</p><p class="calibre_2">It must act as the ultimate reference, a guide to keep the vision clear and the project on track during the difficult and exciting times ahead when the proper development begins.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_123"/>


<div id="filepos194495" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Creativity through constraints</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The main risk of defining and refining a game concept when is in its ideation stage is to underestimate the project scope or the actual ability of the team to accomplish such effort. The fact that these limits exist is all good news though. Imagine having a blank canvas and being told to draw a beautiful painting, or having a blank page and having to write a short story. This is when artists experience a<span class="italic">rtist's block</span>: the inability to produce any new work or let their creativity flow.</p><p class="calibre_2">Your blank canvas is your ideation space. The more constraints you can identify, the more that space will shrink, allowing you to focus on ideas that could actually work! The size of your team, the expertise on the platform, your budget, the available technology... They all help to inform what you can and cannot realistically do. Every design decision you will make will be somehow constrained. You have to embrace those limits and create something that works within them. Game design is problem-solving, which usually means compromising.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_125"/>


<div id="filepos195792" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Finding the fun</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">What do you think about this?</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">A game where you play as an astronaut who watches Planet Earth being destroyed from a space station?</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Or this?</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">An augmented reality game in which you use your phone to find clues and solve mysteries.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">These may sound like good hooks for a game concept (if you think about that first one, that could be a hook for a book or a movie as well), but the most important thing when you are ideating your game is: How can this be fun? What do you do in that game? Is the space station game a survival adventure or a horror? Is it about managing resources or survival? Is it a space shooter? Think about the games you love, what makes them fun? And what is fun anyway? Is it the joy of learning and mastering new systems, of exploring and interacting with the virtual worlds, making interesting choices?</p><p class="calibre_2">We'll be exploring the connection between <span class="italic">fun</span> and game mechanics in further chapters while trying to avoid any unnecessary immersions in the theory. That said, it doesn't mean that you don't have to! There are entire books dedicated to the topic of <span class="italic">fun</span>. Raph Kostner's <span class="italic">Theory of Fun</span> and Nicole Lazarro's <span class="italic">Four Keys to Fun</span> are just two of many noteworthy examples.</p><p class="calibre_2">Good designers are fluent with practical game design techniques and well informed in the theory. Excellent game designers are experts in both. Fun in games comes from the player experience, which is ultimately related to the core game mechanics. As you can imagine, if those core mechanics are not fun, no one will be interested in the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Of course, you cannot wait until the game is finished to try it out and see whether it's fun... So how do you do it?</p><p class="calibre_2">There's only one answer to this question, and it is by prototyping.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_127"/>


<div id="filepos198099" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Prototyping</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We will talk about prototyping in detail later; for now, let's just get some basics:</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Only 15 years ago, building a prototype for a video game concept or to just try out some mechanics was out of the question for most game developers. Today, with tools such as Unity and other accessible game engines, prototyping is extremely quick and efficient, and most importantly, not only a prerogative of games programmers.</p><p class="calibre_2">Imagine that you want to make a 3D game where two armies clash in battle. Developing a playable demo of such a game, with 3D models of every soldier, the battleground, and the rules behind movement and fighting, is a massive amount of work.</p><p class="calibre_2">And what if after everything is ready, you find out that the battle is not as fun as you thought it would be?</p><p class="calibre_2">Prototyping means focusing on the essentials and answering particular gameplay questions. Once it is clear what we want to test out with a prototype—in this case, whether the battle mechanics are fun—we realize that we don't need fully rendered 3D models for soldiers and accurate terrain. We probably don't even need the soldiers.</p><p class="calibre_2">By abstracting, we'll find out that we will just need some cubes moving on a flat plane. Setting up a plane and some cubes require 5 minutes of work in Unity. Clearly, the challenge would be to make them move and act as if they were soldiers on a battlefield, but since that's what we need to focus on, we can do just that. Eventually, you will find out that the concept of <span class="italic">two armies fighting</span> was too generic to have a meaningful or realistic prototype. You have to search for the fun at an even more abstract level. You have to ask yourself other questions. What kind of battle are you trying to represent? A medieval battle is very different from a battle between tanks in the Second World War.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">If you're planning to show the prototype to a less imaginative audience, you might want to replace the abstract cubes and shapes with some basic models and images found on the internet. The likes of Unity Asset Store can be a great source of effective prototyping assets! Just make sure that the audience realizes that you're not trying to represent the final look of the game.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_129"/>


<div id="filepos200966" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Iteration</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">While prototyping, you essentially <span class="italic">iterate on the concept</span>, stripping it down to its core.</p><p class="calibre_2">For example, you may find out that the essence of the game you're trying to make can be described as your unit charging the enemy in a medieval battle. That's your next direction for prototyping, just focus on the charge element, on the enemy's reaction. They can flee if you're charging from one side, or react by firing arrows or standing their ground if you're charging from the front.</p><p class="calibre_2">All you will see on your screen is going to be just colored cubes chasing each other. But that's already a great start. The sooner you have something playable, the sooner your vision will become more tangible and you will have real feedback not only on its playability but also on its feasibility.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember, there's no need to prototype something that's already been proven. There's no point in prototyping running and jumping for a 2D platformer if you already have a strong reference to them. Your prototypes should focus on the USP! For example, the portal gun and its mechanics in <span class="italic">Portal</span> are more important to prototype than the behavior of the automated turrets.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_131"/>


<div id="filepos202453" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Defining the fantasy</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The common association in the part of the word <span class="italic">fantasy</span> is with a fictional world populated by magic and fantastic creatures. Let's leave that idea of fantasy behind for now. By <span class="italic">fantasy</span> here, we mean the <span class="italic">activity of imagining things</span>, not necessarily things that cannot happen in our real world. You can fantasize about being a doctor, an athlete, or a gangster. That's what we mean by <span class="italic">fantasy</span>. Defining the fantasy means establishing the imaginary settings and environments for the game world and the actions the player is able to use in it.</p><p class="calibre_2">The fantasy is not something that needs to be explicitly stated in the game concept, as it emerges from how the game is designed around the initial vision.</p><p class="calibre_2">In the example we made previously in the <span class="italic">Prototyping</span> section, we were creating a strategy battle game set in a medieval past. Through iterations, we strip the game to its core, imagining the fun of issuing orders to our units, commanding a charge through enemy lines.</p><p class="calibre_2">What we did there is come up with a fantasy. The fantasy of being a general ordering troops to charge into battle and conquer enemies. Note how the genre influences the fantasy. A strategy game with many different troops to command implies the player is the <span class="italic">strategist</span>, therefore the fantasy is being a general of a medieval army.</p><p class="calibre_2">If the concept (and the prototype) was about a first-person action game where you command a Knight during a charge on the enemy lines, we would have a completely different fantasy (the player being the heroic knight leading the charge). Different fantasy, same setting (and same battle).</p><p class="calibre_2">Other common fantasies in games include being a hero through his journey to save someone (from <span class="italic">Super Mario</span> to <span class="italic">Legend of Zelda</span>) or controlling a team in a specific sport. Again, a fantasy always suggests a genre, but it describes something more telling: a bigger story about the player's actions. Clearly, defining a fantasy means setting up more guidelines that will drive the entire development and any design decision down the line.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_133"/>


<div id="filepos204953" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Creating the fantasy through game mechanics</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Let's go back to the charging knight example we just made. You want that charge to be spectacular, tense, and ultimately satisfying for the player; that means designing the enemy reaction and behavior (and even the game physics) in a way that is meaningful for that fantasy. Imagine if the combat system doesn't include any physics and the Knight simply stops in front of his target after the charge and begins a static fight where both he and his enemy just swing their weapons until one is defeated. Wouldn't it be so much better if the momentum built by the charge sends the enemy through the air and the Knight continues advancing until the momentum is gone (and many enemies have been knocked out). Creating such a game requires the design of the core mechanics to be built around a very specific fantasy.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_135"/>

This combination evokes an emotional response from the player and defines the mood of a game.</p><p class="calibre_2">The mood is very much part of the design like any other element, as important as gameplay or story. Games such as <span class="italic">Limbo</span> and <span class="italic">Journey</span> are essentially designed around a mood, with the specific intention of evoking certain emotions in the player as a central part of the experience.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Usually, it's not the game designer's job to define the mood of a game, but as we have seen, the mood influences the design and vice versa, so it is always an ongoing conversation within the team. Artists create amazing content that can define the mood and the soul of any game and sometimes it's the designer's responsibility to put it together. He might be the first one to actually see it "in-game." Keeping in touch with the art team is crucial to the final quality of the game; designing new content that the art team will have to create is not unidirectional.
