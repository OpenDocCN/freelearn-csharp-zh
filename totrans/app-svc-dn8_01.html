    <h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-20">Introducing Apps and Services with .NET</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this first chapter, the goals are setting up your development environment to use Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code and understanding your choices for building apps and services; we will review good places to look for help.</p>
    <p class="normal">The GitHub repository for this book has solutions using full application projects for all code tasks:</p>
    <p class="normal"><a href="https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/">https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/</a></p>
    <p class="normal">After going to the GitHub repository, simply press the <em class="italic">.</em> (dot) key on your keyboard or change <code class="inlineCode">.com</code> to <code class="inlineCode">.dev</code> to change the repository into a live code editor based on Visual Studio Code using GitHub Codespaces.</p>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio Code in a web browser is great to run alongside your chosen code editor as you work through the book’s coding tasks. You can compare your code to the solution code and easily copy and paste parts if needed.</p>
    <p class="normal">Throughout this book, I use the term <strong class="keyWord">modern .NET</strong> to refer to .NET 8 and its predecessors like .NET 6, which come from .NET Core. I use the term <strong class="keyWord">legacy .NET</strong> to refer to .NET Framework, Mono, Xamarin, and .NET Standard. Modern .NET is a unification of those legacy platforms and standards.</p>
    <p class="normal">This chapter covers the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Introducing this book and its contents</li>
      <li class="bulletList">App and service technologies</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Setting up your development environment</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Exploring top-level programs, functions, and namespaces</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Making good use of the GitHub repository for this book</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Where to go for help</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-21">Introducing this book and its contents</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book caters to two audiences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Readers who have completed my book for beginners, <em class="italic">C# 12 and .NET 8 – Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals</em>, and now want to take their learning further.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Readers who already have basic skills and knowledge about C# and .NET and want to learn practical skills and knowledge to build real-world applications and services.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-22">Companion books to continue your learning journey</h2>
    <p class="normal">This book is the second of three books in a trilogy that continues your learning journey through .NET 8:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">The first book covers the fundamentals of the C# language, the .NET libraries, and ASP.NET Core for web development. It is designed to be read linearly because skills and knowledge from earlier chapters build up and are needed to understand later chapters.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">This second book covers more specialized topics like internationalization and popular third-party packages including Serilog and NodaTime. You will learn how to build native AOT-compiled services with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs and how to improve performance, scalability, and reliability using caching, queues, and background services. You will implement more services using GraphQL, gRPC, SignalR, and Azure Functions. Finally, you will learn how to build graphical user interfaces for websites, desktop, and mobile apps with Blazor and .NET MAUI.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">The third book covers important tools and skills that a professional .NET developer should have. These include design patterns and solution architecture, debugging, memory analysis, all the important types of testing whether unit, performance, or web and mobile, and then hosting and deployment topics like Docker and Azure Pipelines. Finally, we look at how to prepare for an interview to get the .NET developer career that you want.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">A summary of the .NET 8 trilogy and their most important topics is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.1</em>:</p>

    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-23">What you will learn in this book</h2>
    <p class="normal">After this first chapter, this book can be divided into four parts:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1"><strong class="keyWord">Managing data</strong>: How to store and manage data locally and in the cloud with SQL Server and Azure Cosmos DB. Later chapters use the SQL Server database and entity models that you will create at the end of <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Building Entity Models for SQL Server Using EF Core</em>. The chapter about Cosmos DB uses the SQL API, and there is an online-only chapter about Gremlin, which is a graph API.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Specialized libraries</strong>: Dates, times, and internationalization; improving performance with threads and tasks; and third-party libraries for image handling, data validation rules, and so on. These chapters can be treated like a cookbook of recipes. If you are not interested in any topic, you can skip it, and you can read them in any order.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">Service technologies</strong>: How to build and secure services with ASP.NET Core Web API Minimal APIs, GraphQL, gRPC, SignalR, and Azure Functions. To improve service scalability and reliability we cover queues, caching, and event scheduling. There is also an online-only chapter about OData services.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="keyWord">User interface technologies</strong>: How to build user interfaces with ASP.NET Core, Blazor, and .NET MAUI.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-24">My learning philosophy</h2>
    <p class="normal">Most people learn complex topics best by imitation and repetition rather than reading a detailed explanation of the theory; therefore, I will not overload you with detailed explanations of every step throughout this book. The idea is to get you to write some code and see it run.</p>
    <p class="normal">You don’t need to know all the nitty-gritty details immediately. That will be something that comes with time as you build your own apps and go beyond what any book can teach you.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-25">Fixing my mistakes</h2>
    <p class="normal">In the words of Samuel Johnson, author of the English dictionary in 1755, I have committed “<em class="italic">a few wild blunders, and risible absurdities, from which no work of such multiplicity is free.</em>” I take sole responsibility for these and hope you appreciate the challenge of my attempt to lash the wind by writing this book about rapidly evolving technologies like C# and .NET, and the apps and services that you can build with them.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">If you have an issue with something in this book, then please contact me before resorting to a negative review on Amazon. Authors cannot respond to Amazon reviews so I cannot contact you to resolve the problem. I want to help you to get the best from my book, and I want to listen to your feedback and do better in the next edition. Please email me (my email address can be found in the GitHub repository for the book), chat with me in the Discord channel for the book (<a href="https://packt.link/apps_and_services_dotnet8">https://packt.link/apps_and_services_dotnet8</a>), or raise an issue at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/issues">https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/issues</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-26">Finding the solution code on GitHub</h2>
    <p class="normal">The solution code in the GitHub repository for this book for all code editors is available at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/tree/main/code">https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/tree/main/code</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-27">Project naming and port numbering conventions</h2>
    <p class="normal">If you complete all the coding tasks in this book, then you will end up with dozens of projects. Many of those will be websites and services that require port numbers for hosting on the <code class="inlineCode">localhost</code> domain.</p>
    <p class="normal">With large, complex solutions, it can be difficult to navigate the entire code. So, a good reason to structure your projects well is to make it easier to find components. It is good to have an overall name for your solution that reflects the application or solution.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the 1990s, Microsoft registered <strong class="keyWord">Northwind</strong> as a fictional company name for use in database and code samples. It was first used as the sample database for their Access product and then also used in SQL Server. We will build multiple projects for this fictional company, so we will use the name <code class="inlineCode">Northwind</code> as a prefix for all the project names.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Good Practice</strong>: There are many ways to structure and name projects and solutions, for example, using a folder hierarchy as well as a naming convention. If you work in a team, make sure you know how your team does it.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">It is good to have a naming convention for your projects in a solution so that any developer can tell what each one does instantly. A common choice is to use the type of project, for example, class library, console app, website, and so on, as shown in <em class="italic">Table 1.1</em>:</p>

    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-28">Treating warnings as errors</h2>
    <p class="normal">By default, compiler warnings may appear if there are potential problems with your code when you first build a project, but they do not prevent compilation and they are hidden if you rebuild. Warnings are given for a reason, so ignoring warnings encourages poor development practices.</p>
    <p class="normal">Some developers would prefer to be forced to fix warnings, so .NET provides a project setting to do this, as shown highlighted in the following markup:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;OutputType&gt;Exe&lt;/OutputType&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net8.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
    &lt;ImplicitUsings&gt;enable&lt;/ImplicitUsings&gt;
    &lt;Nullable&gt;enable&lt;/Nullable&gt;
<strong class="hljs-slc">    &lt;TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;</strong><strong class="hljs-literal-slc">true</strong><strong class="hljs-slc">&lt;/TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;</strong>
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">I have enabled the option to treat warnings as errors in (almost) all the solutions in the GitHub repository.</p>
    <p class="normal">The exceptions are the gRPC projects. This is due to a combination of factors. In .NET 7 or later, the compiler will warn if you compile source files that contain only lowercase letters in the name of a type. For example, if you define a <code class="inlineCode">person</code> class, as shown in the following code:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">public class person
{
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This compiler warning has been introduced so that a future version of C# can safely add a new keyword knowing it will not conflict with the name of a type that you have used because only C# keywords should contain only lowercase letters.</p>
    <p class="normal">Unfortunately, the Google tools for generating C# source files from <code class="inlineCode">.proto</code> files generate aliases for class names that only contain lowercase letters, as shown in the following code:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">#region Designer generated code
using pb = global::Google.Protobuf;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">If you treat warnings as errors, then the compiler complains and refuses to compile the source code, as shown in the following output:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">Error CS8981 The type name 'pb' only contains lower-cased ascii characters. Such names may become reserved for the language. Northwind.Grpc.Service C:\apps-services-net8\Chapter14\Northwind.Grpc.Service\obj\Debug\net8.0\Protos\Greet.cs
</code></pre>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Good Practice</strong>: Always treat warnings as errors in your .NET projects (except for gRPC projects until Google updates their code generation tools).</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">If you find that you get too many errors after enabling this, you can disable specific warnings by using the <code class="inlineCode">&lt;WarningsNotAsErrors&gt;</code> element with a comma-separated list of warning codes, as shown in the following markup:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">&lt;WarningsNotAsErrors&gt;0219,CS8981&lt;/WarningsNotAsErrors&gt;
</code></pre>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">More Information</strong>: You can learn more about controlling warnings as errors at the following link: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/errors-warnings#warningsaserrors-and-warningsnotaserrors">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/errors-warnings#warningsaserrors-and-warningsnotaserrors</a>.</p>

    <p class="normal">.NET, .NET Core, .NET Framework, and <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>Xamarin are related and overlapping platforms for developers used to build applications and services. If you are not familiar with the history of .NET, then I will point you to each of these .NET concepts at the following link, which is from the <em class="italic">C# 12 and .NET 8 – Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals</em> book:</p>

    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-31">Building websites and apps using ASP.NET Core</h2>
    <p class="normal">Websites<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> are made up of multiple web pages loaded statically from the filesystem or generated dynamically by a server-side technology such as ASP.NET Core. A web browser makes <code class="inlineCode">GET</code> requests <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>using <strong class="keyWord">Unique Resource Locators </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">URLs</strong>), which identify each page and can manipulate data stored on the server using <code class="inlineCode">POST</code>, <code class="inlineCode">PUT</code>, and <code class="inlineCode">DELETE</code> requests. </p>
    <p class="normal">With many websites, the web browser<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> is treated as a presentation layer, with almost all the processing performed on the server side. Some JavaScript might be used on the client side to implement some presentation features, such as carousels, or to perform data validation.</p>
    <p class="normal">ASP.NET Core<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> provides multiple technologies for building websites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">ASP.NET Core Razor Pages</strong> can <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>dynamically generate HTML for simple websites.</li>

You will learn about using it to build user interfaces in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">Building Web User Interfaces Using ASP.NET Core</em>.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Razor class libraries</strong> provide<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> a way to package reusable functionality for ASP.NET Core projects including user interface components.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Blazor</strong> lets you<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> build user interface components using C# and .NET and then run them in a web browser or embedded web component instead of a JavaScript-based UI framework like Angular, React, and Vue.

    <p class="normal">This book assumes that you are already familiar with the fundamentals of ASP.NET Core development, so although the book reviews the basics, it quickly moves on to intermediate topics.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-32">Building web and other services</h2>
    <p class="normal">There are no formal definitions, but services are sometimes described based on their complexity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Service</strong>: All functionality <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>needed by a client app in one monolithic service.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Microservice</strong>: Multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> services that each focus on a smaller set of functionalities. The guiding principle for what the boundary of functionality should be for a microservice is that each microservice should own its own data. Only that microservice should read/write to that data. If you have a data store that multiple services access, then they are not microservices.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Nanoservice</strong>: A <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>single function provided as a service. Unlike services and microservices that are hosted 24/7/365, nanoservices are often inactive until called upon to reduce resources and costs. For this reason, they are also known as serverless services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Although the theory of microservices and serverless services has made them a fashionable choice over the past decade or so, monolithic services have recently had a resurgence in popularity as developers have found the reality of microservices does not always match the theory.</p>
    <p class="normal">You will learn how to build ASP.NET Core Web API and Minimal API web services that use HTTP as the underlying communication technology and follow the design principles of Roy Field’s REST architecture. You will also learn how to build services using web and other technologies that extend basic web APIs, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">gRPC</strong>: For building<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> highly efficient and performant microservices with support for almost any platform.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">SignalR</strong>: For<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> implementing real-time communications between components. </li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">GraphQL</strong>: For letting the client control what data is retrieved across multiple data sources. Although GraphQL<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> can use HTTP, it does not have to, and it does not follow the web design principles defined by Roy Field in his dissertation about REST APIs.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Azure Functions</strong>: For hosting<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> serverless nanoservices in the cloud. </li>

    <p class="normal">In 2006, Microsoft released .NET Framework 3.0 with some major new frameworks, one of which was <strong class="keyWord">Windows Communication Foundation</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">WCF</strong>). It abstracted the business logic implementation of a service from the <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>communication technology infrastructure so that you could easily switch to an alternative in the future or even have multiple mechanisms to communicate with the service. </p>
    <p class="normal">WCF heavily uses XML configuration to declaratively define endpoints, including their address, binding, and contract. This is known as the ABCs of WCF endpoints. Once you understand how to do this, WCF is a powerful yet flexible technology.</p>
    <p class="normal">Microsoft decided not to officially port<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> WCF to modern .NET, but there is a community-owned OSS project named <strong class="keyWord">CoreWCF</strong> managed <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>by the .NET Foundation. If you need to migrate an existing service from .NET Framework to modern .NET or build a client to a WCF service, then you can use CoreWCF. Be aware that it can never be a full port since parts of WCF are Windows-specific.</p>
    <p class="normal">Technologies like WCF allow for the building of distributed applications. A client application can make <strong class="keyWord">remote procedure calls</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">RPCs</strong>) to a server application. Instead of using a port of WCF to do this, we should use an<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> alternative RPC technology like gRPC, which is covered in this book.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">More Information</strong>: You can learn more about<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> CoreWCF in its GitHub repository found at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF">https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF</a>. You can read the announcement about client support for calling WCF or CoreWCF with System.ServiceModel 6.0 at the following link: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wcf-client-60-has-been-released/">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wcf-client-60-has-been-released/</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-34">Common service principles</h2>
    <p class="normal">One of the most important service <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>architecture principles is to make method calls chunky instead of chatty. In other words, try to bundle all the data needed for an operation in a single call, rather than requiring multiple calls to transmit all that information. This is because the overhead of a remote call is one of the biggest negative effects of services. This is also why having smaller and smaller services can hugely negatively impact a solution architecture.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-35">Summary of choices for services</h2>
    <p class="normal">Each service technology<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> has its pros and cons based on its feature support, as shown in <em class="italic">Table 1.2</em>:</p>

    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-37">Understanding legacy Windows application platforms</h3>
    <p class="normal">With the Microsoft <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>Windows 1.0 release in 1985, the only way to create Windows applications was to use the C language and call functions in three core DLLs named <code class="inlineCode">KERNEL</code>, <code class="inlineCode">USER</code>, and <code class="inlineCode">GDI</code>. Once Windows became 32-bit with Windows 95, the DLLs were suffixed with 32 and became known <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>as <strong class="keyWord">Win32 API</strong>.</p>
    <p class="normal">In 1991, Microsoft introduced Visual Basic, which provided developers with a visual, drag-and-drop-from-a-toolbox-of-controls way to build the user interface for Windows applications. It was immensely popular, and the Visual Basic runtime is still distributed as part of Windows 11 today.</p>
    <p class="normal">With the first version of C# and .NET Framework released in 2002, Microsoft provided technology for building Windows desktop applications <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>named <strong class="keyWord">Windows Forms</strong>. The equivalent at the time for web development was named <strong class="keyWord">Web Forms</strong>, hence the<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> complementary names. The code could be written in either Visual Basic or C# languages. Windows Forms had a similar drag-and-drop visual designer, although it generated C# or Visual Basic code to define the user interface, which can be difficult for humans to understand and edit directly.</p>
    <p class="normal">In 2006, Microsoft released a <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>more powerful technology for building Windows desktop applications, named <strong class="keyWord">Windows Presentation Foundation </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">WPF</strong>), as a <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>key component<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> of .NET Framework 3.0 alongside <strong class="keyWord">WCF</strong> and Windows<strong class="keyWord"> Workflow </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">WF</strong>).</p>
    <p class="normal">Although a WPF app can be created by writing only C# statements, it can also use <strong class="keyWord">eXtensible Application Markup Language </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">XAML</strong>) to<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> specify its user interface, which is easy for both humans and code to understand. Visual Studio 2022 is partially built with WPF.</p>
    <p class="normal">In 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 with its Windows Store apps that run in a protected sandbox. </p>
    <p class="normal">In 2015, Microsoft released Windows 10 with an updated Windows Store app concept named <strong class="keyWord">Universal Windows Platform </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">UWP</strong>). UWP <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>apps can be built using C++ and DirectX UI, JavaScript and HTML, or C# using a custom fork of modern .NET that is not cross-platform but provides full access to the underlying WinRT APIs.</p>
    <p class="normal">UWP apps can only execute on the Windows 10 or Windows 11 platforms, not earlier versions of Windows, but UWP apps can run on Xbox and Windows Mixed Reality headsets with motion controllers.</p>
    <p class="normal">Many <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>Windows developers rejected Windows Store and UWP apps because they have limited access to the underlying system. Microsoft recently<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> created <strong class="keyWord">Project Reunion</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">WinUI 3</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> work together to allow Windows developers to bring some of the benefits of modern Windows development to their existing WPF apps and allow them to have the same benefits and system<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> integrations that UWP apps have. This initiative is now known as <strong class="keyWord">Windows App SDK</strong>.</p>

    <p class="normal">There are many enterprise applications built using Windows Forms and WPF that need to be maintained or enhanced with new features, but until recently they were stuck on .NET Framework, which is now a legacy platform.

    <p class="normal">.NET MAUI makes it easy to develop those apps by sharing user interface components as well as business logic; they can target the same .NET APIs as used by console apps, websites, and web services.</p>
    <p class="normal">The apps can exist standalone, but they usually call services to provide an experience that spans all your computing devices, from servers and laptops to phones and gaming systems.</p>

    <p class="normal">Uno is “<em class="italic">the first C# &amp; XAML, free and open-source platform for creating true single-source, multi-platform applications</em>,” as<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> stated on<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> its own website at the following link: <a href="https://platform.uno/">https://platform.uno/</a>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Developers can reuse 99% of the business logic and UI layer across native mobile, web, and desktop.</p>
    <p class="normal">The Uno platform uses the Xamarin native platform but not Xamarin.Forms. For WebAssembly, Uno uses the mono-wasm runtime just like Blazor WebAssembly. For Linux, Uno uses Skia to draw the user interface on the canvas.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">A book to read to learn about the Uno platform can be found at the following link: <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/creating-cross-platform-c-applications-with-uno-platform/9781801078498">https://www.packtpub.com/product/creating-cross-platform-c-applications-with-uno-platform/9781801078498</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-42">Understanding Avalonia</h3>
    <p class="normal">Avalonia “<em class="italic">is a cross-platform UI framework for .NET. It creates pixel-perfect, native apps</em>” and “<em class="italic">is supported on all major platforms</em>.” Avalonia “<em class="italic">is the trusted UI framework for complex apps</em>,” as stated <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>on its official<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> website home page at the following link: <a href="https://avaloniaui.net/">https://avaloniaui.net/</a>.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can think of Avalonia as a spiritual successor to WPF. WPF, Silverlight, and UWP developers can continue to benefit from their years of pre-existing knowledge and skills. </p>
    <p class="normal">It was used by JetBrains to modernize their legacy WPF-based tools and take them cross-platform. This means their C# code editor runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
    <p class="normal">The Avalonia extension for Visual Studio 2022 and deep integration with JetBrains Rider makes development easier and more productive.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we’ve reviewed the theory about the apps and services technologies that can be used with .NET 8, let’s get practical and see how you can set up your development environment.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-43">Setting up your development environment</h1>
    <p class="normal">Before you<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> start programming, you’ll need a code editor for C#. Microsoft has a family of code editors and <strong class="keyWord">Integrated Development Environments</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IDEs</strong>), which<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Visual Studio 2022 for Windows</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Visual Studio Code for Windows, Mac, or Linux</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Visual Studio Code for the Web or GitHub Codespaces</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Third parties have created their own C# code editors, for example, JetBrains Rider, which is available for Windows, Mac, or Linux but does have a license cost. JetBrains Rider is popular with more experienced .NET developers.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Warning!</strong> Although JetBrains is a fantastic company with great products, both Rider and the ReSharper extension for Visual Studio are software, and all software has bugs and quirky behavior. For example, they might show errors like “Cannot resolve symbol” in your Razor Pages, Razor views, and Blazor components. Yet you can build and run those files because there is no actual problem. If you have installed the Unity Support plugin, then it will complain about boxing operations, which are a genuine problem for Unity game developers. But in this book we will not create any Unity projects so the boxing warnings do not apply.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapters 1</em> to <em class="chapterRef">15</em>, you can use Visual Studio 2022 or cross-platform Visual Studio Code and JetBrains Rider to build all the apps and services. In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italic">Building Mobile and Desktop Apps Using .NET MAUI</em>; and its <em class="chapterRef">online sections</em>, <em class="italic">Implementing Model-View-ViewModel for .NET MAUI</em> and <em class="italic">Integrating .NET MAUI Apps with Blazor and Native Platforms</em>, although you could use Visual Studio Code to build the mobile and desktop app, it is not easy. Visual Studio 2022 has better support for .NET MAUI than Visual Studio Code does (for now).</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-44">Choosing the appropriate tool and application type for learning</h2>
    <p class="normal">What is the best tool and application type for building apps and services with C# and .NET?</p>
    <p class="normal">I want you to be free to choose any C# code editor or IDE to complete the coding tasks in this book, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio 2022, or even JetBrains Rider.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this book, I give general instructions that work with all tools so you can use whichever tool you prefer.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-45">Using Visual Studio 2022 for general development</h3>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio 2022 can<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> create most types of applications, including console apps, websites, web services, desktop, and mobile apps. </p>
    <p class="normal">Although you can use Visual Studio 2022 with a .NET MAUI project to write a cross-platform mobile app, you still need macOS and Xcode to compile it.</p>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio 2022 only <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>runs on Windows 10 version 1909 or later, or Windows Server 2016 or later, and only on 64-bit versions. Version 17.4 is the first version to support native Arm64.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">Warning!</strong> Visual Studio 2022 for Mac does not officially support .NET 8 and it will reach end-of-life in August 2024. If you have been using Visual Studio 2022 for Mac then you should switch to Visual Studio Code for Mac, JetBrains Rider for Mac, or use Visual Studio 2022 for Windows in a virtual machine on your local computer or in the cloud using a technology like Microsoft Dev Box. The retirement announcement can be read here: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-for-mac-retirement-announcement/">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-for-mac-retirement-announcement/</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-46">Using Visual Studio Code for cross-platform development</h3>
    <p class="normal">The most modern and lightweight<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> code editor to choose from, and the only one from Microsoft that is cross-platform, is Visual Studio Code. It can run on all common operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and many varieties of Linux, including <strong class="keyWord">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">RHEL</strong>)<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> and Ubuntu.</p>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio Code is a good choice for modern cross-platform development because it has an extensive and growing set of extensions to support many languages beyond C#.</p>
    <p class="normal">Being cross-platform and lightweight, it can be installed on all platforms that your apps will be deployed to for quick bug fixes and so on. Choosing Visual Studio Code means a developer can use a cross-platform code editor to develop cross-platform apps.</p>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio Code has strong support for web development, although it currently has weak support for mobile and desktop development.</p>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio Code is supported on ARM processors, so you can develop on Apple Silicon computers and Raspberry Pi.</p>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio Code is by far the most popular integrated development environment, with over 73% of professional developers selecting it in the Stack Overflow 2023 survey that you can read at the following link: <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/">https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-47">Using GitHub Codespaces for development in the cloud</h3>
    <p class="normal">GitHub Codespaces <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>is a fully configured development environment based on Visual Studio Code that can be spun up in an environment hosted in the cloud and accessed through any web browser. It supports Git repos, extensions, and a built-in command-line interface so you can edit, run, and test from any device.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">More Information</strong>: You can learn more about GitHub Codespaces<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">https://github.com/features/codespaces</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-48">What I used</h3>
    <p class="normal">To write and test the code for this book, I used the following hardware and software:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Visual Studio 2022 for Windows on:<ul>
          <li class="bulletList">Windows 11 on the HP Spectre (Intel) laptop</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="bulletList">Visual Studio Code on:<ul>
          <li class="bulletList">macOS on the Apple Silicon Mac mini (M1) desktop</li>
          <li class="bulletList">Windows 11 on the HP Spectre (Intel) laptop</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="bulletList">JetBrains Rider on:<ul>
          <li class="bulletList">Windows 11 on the HP Spectre (Intel) laptop</li>
          <li class="bulletList">macOS on the Apple Silicon Mac mini (M1) desktop</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">I hope that you have access to a variety of hardware and software too because seeing the differences on various platforms deepens your understanding of development challenges, although any one of the above combinations is enough to learn how to build practical apps and websites.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Getting Started</strong>: <em class="italic">Chapter 1</em> of the <em class="italic">C# 12 and .NET 8 – Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals</em> book has online sections showing how to get started with multiple projects using various code editors like Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider. You can read the sections at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/code-editors/README.md">https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/code-editors/README.md</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-49">JetBrains Rider and its warnings about boxing</h3>
    <p class="normal">If you use JetBrains <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>Rider and you have installed the Unity Support plugin, then it will complain a lot about boxing. A common scenario when boxing happens is when value types like <code class="inlineCode">int</code> and <code class="inlineCode">DateTime</code> are passed as positional arguments to <code class="inlineCode">string</code> formats. This is a problem for Unity projects because they use a different memory garbage collector to the normal .NET runtime. For non-Unity projects, like all the projects in this book, you can ignore these boxing warnings because they are not relevant. You can read more about this Unity-specific issue at the following link: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/performance-garbage-collection-best-practices.html#boxing">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/performance-garbage-collection-best-practices.html#boxing</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-50">Deploying cross-platform</h2>
    <p class="normal">Your choice of code editor and<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> operating system for development does not limit where your code gets deployed.</p>
    <p class="normal">.NET 8<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> supports the following platforms for deployment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Windows</strong>: Windows 10 version 1607 or later. Windows 11 version 22000 or later. Windows Server 2012 R2 SP1 or later. Nano Server version 1809 or later.</li>

    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-51">Downloading and installing Visual Studio 2022</h2>
    <p class="normal">Many professional <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>Microsoft developers use Visual Studio 2022 in their day-to-day development work. Even if you choose to use Visual Studio Code to complete the coding tasks in this book, you might want to familiarize yourself with Visual Studio 2022 too.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you do not have a Windows computer, then you can skip this section and continue to the next section where you will download and install Visual Studio Code on macOS or Linux.</p>
    <p class="normal">Since October 2014, Microsoft has made a professional quality edition of Visual Studio 2022 available to students, open-source contributors, and individuals for free. It is called Community Edition. Any of the editions are suitable for this book. If you have not already installed it, let’s do so now:</p>

    <p class="normal">In this book, I will avoid <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>showing keyboard shortcuts since they are often customized. Where they are consistent across code editors and commonly used, I will try to show them.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you want to identify and customize your keyboard shortcuts, then you can, as shown at the following link: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/identifying-and-customizing-keyboard-shortcuts-in-visual-studio">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/identifying-and-customizing-keyboard-shortcuts-in-visual-studio</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-53">Downloading and installing Visual Studio Code</h2>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio Code<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> has rapidly improved over the past couple of years and has pleasantly surprised Microsoft with its popularity. If you are brave and like to live on the bleeding edge, then there is the <strong class="keyWord">Insiders</strong> edition, which is a daily build of the next version.</p>
    <p class="normal">Even if you plan to only use Visual Studio 2022 for development, I recommend that you download and install Visual Studio Code and try the coding tasks in this chapter using it, and then decide if you want to stick with just using Visual Studio 2022 for the rest of the book.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s now download and install Visual Studio Code, the .NET SDK, and the C# Dev Kit extension:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Download and <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>install either the Stable build or the Insiders edition of Visual Studio Code from the following link: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>.

    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-56">Understanding Microsoft Visual Studio Code versions</h3>
    <p class="normal">Microsoft releases a new<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> feature version of Visual Studio Code (almost) every month and bug-fix versions more frequently. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Version 1.78.0, April 2023 feature release</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Version 1.78.1, April 2023 bug fix release</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">The version used in this book is 1.83.0, September 2023 feature release, but the version of Microsoft Visual Studio Code is less important than the version of the C# extension that you installed.</p>
    <p class="normal">While the C# extension is<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> not required, it provides IntelliSense as you type, code navigation, and debugging features, so it’s something that’s very handy to install and keep updated to support the latest C# language features.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-57">Visual Studio Code keyboard shortcuts</h3>
    <p class="normal">In this book, I will avoid showing <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>keyboard shortcuts used for tasks like creating a new file since they are often different on different operating systems. The situations where I will show keyboard shortcuts are when you need to repeatedly press the key, for example, while debugging. These are also more likely to be consistent across operating systems.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you want to customize your keyboard shortcuts for Visual Studio Code, then you can, as shown at the following link: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings</a>.</p>
    <p class="normal">I recommend that you download a PDF of keyboard shortcuts for your operating system from the following list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Windows: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf</a></li>
      <li class="bulletList">macOS: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf">https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf</a></li>
      <li class="bulletList">Linux: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf">https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-58">Consuming Azure resources</h2>
    <p class="normal">Some of the chapters <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>in this book will require you to sign up for an Azure account and create Azure resources. Frequently, there are free tiers or local development versions of these services, but sometimes you will have to create a resource that generates costs for the time it exists.</p>
    <p class="normal">Packt books use technical reviewers who complete all the coding exercises just like a reader would. Here is what one of the TRs of the <strong class="keyWord">second edition</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">2E</strong>) of this book said about their Azure costs. “I got my Azure bill. To run through 2E on a “paid” account cost me $3.01.”</p>
    <p class="normal">Microsoft currently says, “<em class="italic">Eligible new users get $200 Azure credit in your billing currency for the first 30 days and a limited quantity of free services for 12 months with your Azure free account.</em>” You can learn more at the following link:</p>

    <p class="normal">For the compiler to know where what statements need to go, you must follow some rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Import statements (<code class="inlineCode">using</code>) must go at the top of the <code class="inlineCode">Program.cs</code> file.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Statements that will go in the <code class="inlineCode">&lt;Main&gt;$</code> function must go in the middle of the <code class="inlineCode">Program.cs</code> file.

    </ul>
    <p class="normal">The last point is important because local functions have limitations, for example, they cannot have XML comments to document them.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-63">Writing static functions in a separate Program class file</h2>
    <p class="normal">A better approach is to<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> write any functions in a separate class file and define them as <code class="inlineCode">static</code> members of the <code class="inlineCode">Program</code> class:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Add a new class file named <code class="inlineCode">Program.Functions.cs</code>. The name has no effect, but it is a good practice to name it so that it is clear that this file is related to the <code class="inlineCode">Program.cs</code> class file.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">In <code class="inlineCode">Program.Functions.cs</code>, define a <code class="inlineCode">partial Program</code> class, then cut and paste the <code class="inlineCode">WhatsMyNamespace</code> function to move it from <code class="inlineCode">Program.cs</code> into <code class="inlineCode">Program.Functions.cs</code>, and finally add the <code class="inlineCode">static</code> keyword, as shown highlighted in the following code:

  {
    WriteLine("Namespace of Program class: {0}",
      arg0: typeof(Program).Namespace ?? "null");
  }
<strong class="hljs-slc">}</strong>
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">In <code class="inlineCode">Program.cs</code>, confirm that its entire content is now just three statements, as shown in the following code:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using static System.Console;
WriteLine("Top-level functions example");
WhatsMyNamespace(); // Call the function.
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">Run the<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> console app and note that it has the same behavior as before.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-64">What is automatically generated for a static function?</h2>
    <p class="normal">When you use a separate file to define a partial <code class="inlineCode">Program</code> class with <code class="inlineCode">static</code> functions, the compiler defines a <code class="inlineCode">Program</code> class with a <code class="inlineCode">&lt;Main&gt;$</code> function and moves your top-level statements inside the <code class="inlineCode">&lt;Main&gt;$</code> method, and then merges your function as a member of the <code class="inlineCode">Program</code> class, as shown in the following code:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using static System.Console;
partial class Program
{
  static void &lt;Main&gt;$(String[] args)
  {
    WriteLine("Top-level functions example");
    WhatsMyNamespace(); // Call the function.
  }
  static void WhatsMyNamespace() // Define a static function.
  {
    WriteLine("Namespace of Program class: {0}",
      arg0: typeof(Program).Namespace ?? "null");
  }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This is much cleaner, and you can document your functions with XML comments, which also provide tooltips in your code editor when calling the function.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Good Practice</strong>: Create any functions that you will call in <code class="inlineCode">Program.cs</code> in a separate file and manually define them inside a <code class="inlineCode">partial Program</code> class. This will merge them into the automatically generated <code class="inlineCode">Program</code> class <em class="italic">at the same level</em> as the <code class="inlineCode">&lt;Main&gt;$</code> method, instead of as local functions <em class="italic">inside</em> the <code class="inlineCode">&lt;Main&gt;$</code> method.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">It is important to note the lack of namespace declarations. Both the automatically generated <code class="inlineCode">Program</code> class and the explicitly defined <code class="inlineCode">Program</code> class are in the default <code class="inlineCode">null</code> namespace. If you define your <code class="inlineCode">partial Program</code> class in a namespace, then it will be in a different namespace and therefore not merge with the auto-generated <code class="inlineCode">partial Program</code> class.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Good Practice</strong>: Do not define a namespace for any <code class="inlineCode">partial Program</code> classes that you create so that they will be defined in the default <code class="inlineCode">null</code> namespace.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Optionally, all the <code class="inlineCode">static</code> methods in the <code class="inlineCode">Program</code> class could be explicitly declared as <code class="inlineCode">private</code> but this is the default anyway. Since all the functions will be called within the <code class="inlineCode">Program</code> class itself the access modifier is not important.</p>

You should also avoid special characters like <code class="inlineCode">#</code>. For example, do not use a folder name like <code class="inlineCode">C:\C# projects\</code>.

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.3: ChatGPT advising about microservice architecture design</p>
    <p class="normal">“Designing a microservice architecture is a complex task, and there are several common mistakes that can lead to significant issues, even causing a project to be abandoned. Here are the<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> top three <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>most common mistakes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Improper Service Boundaries: </strong>One of the most challenging aspects of designing a microservice architecture is defining the boundaries of each service. If the services are too large (a mistake often called a “monolith in disguise”), you lose many of the benefits of microservices due to tight coupling of different concerns. On the other hand, if the services are too small (sometimes referred to as “nanoservices”), you might have to deal with excessive inter-service communication, resulting in high latency and complexity. </li>
      <li class="bulletList">A lack of proper boundaries can also lead to data consistency issues. If multiple services are interacting with the same database tables, it can be difficult to maintain data consistency. </li>
      <li class="bulletList">To avoid this mistake, it’s important to understand the business domain thoroughly and design services around business capabilities. Techniques such as <strong class="keyWord">Domain-Driven Design</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">DDD</strong>) can help identify service boundaries more effectively.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Inadequate Consideration for Data Management:</strong> Each microservice should own its own data to ensure loose coupling. Sharing databases across services leads to tight coupling and makes it difficult to change the schema without affecting other services. </li>
      <li class="bulletList">However, managing data across services introduces challenges with data consistency and transaction management. Developers often underestimate these challenges. They might try to implement distributed transactions, which are complex and can hurt performance, instead of using eventual consistency and compensation transactions (the Saga pattern).</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Neglecting Operational Complexity:</strong> Microservice architectures add operational complexity. You’re moving from managing a single monolithic application to managing multiple services, each potentially written in different languages, using different data storage technologies, and running in different environments. </li>
      <li class="bulletList">This requires a mature<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> DevOps capability, including automated deployment, monitoring, and good logging practices. You need to plan for how <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>services will be monitored, how logs will be aggregated and analyzed, and how deployments and rollbacks will be handled. </li>
      <li class="bulletList">Ignoring the operational challenges of microservices can lead to significant issues down the line. For instance, it can become very difficult to debug issues that span multiple services without good tracing and logging. Deploying changes can become a nightmare without automated deployment and good testing practices. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">In conclusion, designing a microservice architecture isn’t a trivial task. It requires a deep understanding of the business domain, careful planning, and a mature DevOps capability. However, when done right, microservices can provide significant benefits, including better scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.”</p>

    <p class="normal">To preserve space in the print book, there are some optional online-only sections available in the GitHub repository. They are not needed for the rest of the book, but you will find them useful for general knowledge:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">What’s New in Modern C# and .NET</strong>: In this section, the goal is to review what is new since C# 6 and .NET Core 1.0, which were released in 2016. Instead of just listing the new features introduced with each version of .NET, this section takes a themed approach to make it easier to understand how small individual improvements introduced over multiple versions are designed to work together. This section will also be updated throughout the lifetime of .NET 8, from November 2023 to November 2026. This will include new language and library features introduced in .NET 9 and .NET 10 (<a href="https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/ch01-whats-new.md">https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/ch01-whats-new.md</a>).</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Benchmarking Performance and Testing</strong>: In this section, you will learn how to use types in the <code class="inlineCode">System.Diagnostics</code> namespace and the Benchmark.NET library to monitor your code to measure performance and efficiency (<a href="https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/ch01-benchmarking.md">https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/ch01-benchmarking.md</a>).</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Observing and Modifying Code Execution Dynamically</strong>: This is about some common types that are included with .NET for performing code reflection and applying and reading attributes, working with expression trees, and creating source generators (<a href="https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/ch01-dynamic-code.md">https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/blob/main/docs/ch01-dynamic-code.md</a>).</li>
