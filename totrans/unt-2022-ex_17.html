<p class="calibre3">Game developers can achieve a remarkable gameplay experience through advanced AI-based interactions using <strong class="bold">NavMesh</strong>, <strong class="bold">Sensors</strong> – both visually via Raycast and audio – implemented with a <strong class="bold">behavior tree</strong>, and Unity’s machine learning solution <strong class="bold">ML-Agents</strong>. By refactoring code from the 2D game, you will gain an understanding of the difference between implementing interactions in 2D <span>and 3D.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">You will learn how to easily convert the FPS game to an immersive <strong class="bold">mixed-reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">MR</strong>) experience with the <strong class="bold">XR Interaction Toolkit</strong>. In no time, you can create a sense of presence in a mix of virtual and real-world environments for players as they understand how to spawn and interact with objects to facilitate gameplay mechanics. You will take away an understanding of how to maintain smooth gameplay while targeting required devices with a simple but immersive game. Winning the game after battling and defeating a boss room encounter will bring all the systems together and provide you with a comprehensive understanding of a working <span>game structure.</span></p>

Unity LiveOps services analyze data to respond to player demand and provide dynamic player content with <strong class="bold">Remote Config</strong>, while a feature-rich version control system, <strong class="bold">Unity Version Control</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Build Automation</strong> streamline the DevOps process. Additionally, you will learn how to distribute your game worldwide using leading game <span>distribution storefronts.</span></p>
