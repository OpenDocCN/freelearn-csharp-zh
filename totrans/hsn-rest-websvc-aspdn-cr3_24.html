                    <h1 class="header-title">Testing Services Using Postman</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">Postman is one of the most powerful tools we can use to query APIs and is mainly available to developers and enterprise teams. In this chapter, we will introduce Postman and show you how to use this tool to test and monitor a web service. Postman is described as an API-first solution with the industry's only complete API development environment. Next, we will learn how to use Postman to call a generic HTTP API. Then, we will learn how to import the OpenAPI Specification we generated in the previous chapter into Postman to automatically generate the API calls that are implemented in the catalog service.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview of Postman</li>
<li class="mce-root">Importing a collection using OpenAPI</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have learned how to use Postman to test and verify API responses through the Postman UI and by using the automated testing tools.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Overview of Postman</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Postman can be used within a company to share internal APIs and applies the concept of collections so that it can group, index, and query web services. A collection is a group of HTTP calls related to the same service or a collection of services.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows a conventional UI for Postman. On the left, you can see a list of <em>collections</em> that are available in the Postman account, while on the right, you can see the core part of the UI:</p>
<div><img src="img/90eb6aca-fc74-4044-99f6-c0a5a9ae01a6.png" style=""/></div>
<p>The first half of the UI represents the HTTP request we intend to launch. Each tab at the top of the interface represents an API call; it is possible to type in a URL and specify the HTTP verb on the left. For each request, it is also possible to specify the query parameters, the authorization specification, the headers, the body, and some scripts that we will execute before and after every request.</p>
<p>Here, the request uses the <kbd>{{baseUrl}}/api/artists/:id</kbd> URL and passes <kbd>id:&lt;guid_value&gt;</kbd>. It is important to note that, in Postman, it is possible to specify environment variables that can be used to parameterize our API queries. In this case, the <kbd>{{baseUrl}}</kbd> placeholder is replaced with the values specified in the collection. It is possible to view the collection variables by clicking on the three dots next to the collection name, selecting Edit, and then navigating to the Variables tab:</p>
<div><img src="img/fcff8238-3dba-42eb-87ba-b7b5daf53bde.png" style=""/></div>
<p>The second part of the Postman interface is focused on the response of the request. The main section contains the JSON response of the API:</p>
<div><img src="img/03db581c-8a6a-4f36-8d11-67f4463c8cae.png" style=""/></div>
<p>On the right-hand side, we have the Status of the response, the response Time, and the Size of the response. Furthermore, it is possible to switch the format of the response so that it's either JSON, HTML, or raw text. The response section also provides some detailed information about the Headers, Cookies, and Test Results.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will learn how to automatically test our API using Postman's tools.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Testing the API using Postman</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Postman also provides us with a helpful tool/framework that we can use to test our APIs automatically. The test runtime is based on Node.js; for that reason, we should write a test assertion using JavaScript. The test framework of Postman uses the following workflow to test our code:</p>
<div><img src="img/007fe9da-7399-431b-ad1a-335f4959ccc7.png" style=""/></div>
<p>The scripts will execute as follows for every request in a collection:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pre-request script will run before every request in the collection. This is considered the setup part of a test case.</li>
<li>A test script will run after every request in the collection; this is the core part of our test. Furthermore, it provides the core assertions for our test.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's use this procedure to implement a simple test for our API:</p>
<pre>pm.test("response is ok", function () {<br/>    pm.response.to.have.status(200);<br/>});</pre>
<p>As you can see, the test uses the <kbd>pm</kbd> global object to describe a test, and it adds a callback function to make some assertions. In this case, it checks whether the API has a status of <kbd>200</kbd> OK. The following implementation can be added to a request by typing the preceding code into the Tests tab of the request, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/5e379cc0-c364-441a-82fe-9ecf0519dfc1.png" style=""/></div>
<p>After that, we will be able to check the result in the response part of Postman:</p>
<div><img src="img/1ca0e823-f4e5-4c7d-b5ca-a1f561d0a2e8.png" style=""/></div>
<p>The test results section that's shown in the preceding screenshot contains four different subtabs, all of which group the tests by the results. If an error occurs, the UI provides details of the error.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using the runner to test the APIs</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Postman team built a runner tool that automatically tests and runs your APIs so that you can – quite literally – sit back and watch your API test itself. Furthermore, you can use scripts to build integration test suites, pass data between API requests, and build workflows that mirror your actual API use cases. </p>
<p>The runner feature requires at least one test to be associated with the request so that it can assert the result. It is possible to access the runner interface of Postman by clicking on the Runner button (shown in the yellow rectangle in the following screenshot), which can be found in the top-left corner of the screen, and selecting the collection you want to run:</p>
<div><img src="img/e8d6489f-8217-47df-baff-5841911b1d2f.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Postman also allows us to integrate these functionalities using the CLI. The development team published an <kbd>npm</kbd> package to execute the runner in a localhost environment. It is possible to install this package on your local machine using the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>npm install -g newman</strong><br/></pre>
<p>After that, it is possible to execute the runner on a specific collection by passing the JSON file that represents the collection and then executing the preceding command. It is possible to export a collection by clicking on the three points next to the collection and clicking on the Export option:</p>
<div><img src="img/16d976d6-9b72-4a18-ade8-104bb5d2741f.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Then, we can proceed by executing this command on the file:</p>
<pre><strong>newman run examples/sample-collection.json</strong></pre>
<p>The resulting execution will look something similar to the following:</p>
<div><img src="img/f06b7f68-082e-4de4-ad13-042d963e41fd.png" style=""/></div>
<p>This implementation provides a single and detailed response of each request that was tested and a final report that shows all the information related to the tests. This approach is really useful when we want to integrate Postman's testing capabilities into a continuous integration pipeline. All we need to do is install the <kbd>newman</kbd> tool on our server and add the path of the collection.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will learn how to use the OpenAPI Specification (described in the previous chapter) to automatically generate a Postman collection. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Importing a collection using OpenAPI</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this section, you will learn how to import a collection using the OpenAPI Specification. Postman uses some of common API description standards, such as OpenAPI v3, Swagger v2 and v1 (as described in the previous chapter), to import the routes of web services. Let's get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, click on the Import (shown in the yellow rectangle) button at the top-left corner of the screen and click on the Import from Link tab:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/fef80a91-2a6f-48aa-afd7-30e88edc7985.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Now, we can copy and paste the URL of the document API of the running localhost service, like so:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">http://localhost:5000/swagger/v3/swagger.json</pre>
<p>By doing this, the collection will be imported with the same name that we gave our Swagger document. This will contain a selection of all the routes that were described by Swagger. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we learned how to use Postman to query, test, and monitor web services. Postman's capabilities go beyond this; however, we can also share collections of APIs with other teams and with our consumers. It is an essential tool for any API consumer if they wish to check the results and the information provided by the consumed services.</p>
<p>You now have the necessary knowledge to use the Postman suite to test and verify a web service.</p>
