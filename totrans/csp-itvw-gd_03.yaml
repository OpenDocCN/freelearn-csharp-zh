    captures only your upper body, but that doesn’t mean you should neglect your appearance

    your confidence but also keep you prepared for unexpected situations, such as
    needing to stand up during the interview.

    any potential background noise.

    for the company culture. If you’re unsure about the company’s dress code, it’s
    better to err on the side of being overdressed than underdressed. Business professional
    attire is a safe choice for most interviews. For men, this typically includes
    a suit and tie, while for women, it can be a suit, professional dress, or skirt
    and blouse. Regardless of gender, ensure your clothes are clean, wrinkle-free,
    and in good condition.

    to detail and can set the tone for the interview. Avoid overly flashy colors and

    grooming should not be neglected. Neat hair, trimmed nails, and subtle cologne
    or perfume can complement your professional look.

    Maintaining appropriate eye contact shows the interviewer that you’re engaged,

    maintaining eye contact and staring. The aim is to create a connection, not make
    the other person uncomfortable.

    not too tight, not too limp – can convey confidence and assertiveness. Remember

    we briefly touched upon body language earlier, a detailed analysis of this aspect
    can greatly enhance your interview performance. Good posture indicates confidence
    and interest while maintaining eye contact displays attentiveness. Similarly,
    controlled facial expressions can portray a composed and professional demeanor.
    Learning to use gestures effectively can add emphasis to your words and indicate
