- en: Part one of the book will start by exploring the various network architectures
    that make distributed programming possible in the first place. It will examine
    the standards adhered to by hardware and software vendors to allow communication
    across networks, including the DNS naming system, IPv4 and IPv6 standards for
    device addressing, and local hardware-level APIs and data structures that allow
    users to program for those networks, with basic examples of C# software that leverage
    or demonstrate these concepts.
