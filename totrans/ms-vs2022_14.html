   <p>
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Visual Studio extensions
     
    </strong>
    
     are powerful
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker770">
    </a>
    
     tools that enhance the capabilities of Microsoft Visual Studio, allowing developers to customize and extend the IDE to better suit their development needs.
    
    
     This section delves into the underlying architecture of Visual Studio extensions, highlighting key components, their interactions, and the broader ecosystem they
    
    
     
      operate within.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Visual Studio extensions are built upon a robust foundation known as the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Visual Studio Shell
     
    </strong>
    
     , which
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker771">
    </a>
    
     serves as the core environment for interactions with the IDE.
    
    
     This shell is highly customizable, providing a framework that allows us to create and integrate new features seamlessly.
    
    
     The process of developing an extension begins with the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      extension manifest
     
    </strong>
    
     , a
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker772">
    </a>
    
     crucial file that contains essential metadata, such as the extension’s name, version, description, and dependencies.
    
    
     This manifest is vital for the installation process within Visual Studio and plays a significant role in managing updates once the extension
    
    
     
      is deployed.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     At the heart of the extension
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker773">
    </a>
    
     lies the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      package
     
    </strong>
    
     component, which encapsulates all the necessary functionalities and assets, including
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Dynamic Link Library
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      DLL
     
    </strong>
    
     ) and
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker774">
    </a>
    
     images, into a single, deployable unit.
    
    
     This packaging ensures that all required files are correctly installed and configured within the Visual Studio environment.
    
    
     For extensions that need to interact with the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      user interface
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      UI
     
    </strong>
    
     ), the
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker775">
    </a>
    
     inclusion of menu commands and tool windows is necessary.
    
    
     These elements, defined using XML, can be dynamically enabled or disabled based on specific conditions or events occurring within
    
    
     
      the IDE.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     When an extension operates at the project level,
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      project system integration
     
    </strong>
    
     becomes
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker776">
    </a>
    
     essential.
    
    
     This involves working with the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      project system object model
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      PSOM
     
    </strong>
    
     ), which
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker777">
    </a>
    
     represents the project’s structure and properties within Visual Studio.
    
    
     Extensions that offer code generation and analysis tools leverage APIs provided by Visual Studio to generate boilerplate code, refactor existing code, or perform comprehensive code analysis.
    
    
     Finally, the success of an extension often hinges on effectively utilizing
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker778">
    </a>
    
     various
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      integration points
     
    </strong>
    
     offered by Visual Studio, such as event handlers that allow the extension to respond to specific IDE operations, such as opening documents or building solutions.
    
    
     These integration points enable extensions to automate tasks and enhance the user experience by responding to actions taken within
    
    
     
      the IDE.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In addition to the core components that make up a Visual Studio extension,
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Visual Studio Marketplace
     
    </strong>
    
     plays a
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker779">
    </a>
    
     pivotal role in the ecosystem.
    
    
     This platform serves as the primary distribution hub for extensions, enabling developers to easily find, install, and manage a wide array of third-party tools.
    
    
     Visual Studio Marketplace not only streamlines the process of accessing extensions but also fosters community engagement by providing a space for feedback and interaction between developers
    
    
     
      and users.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     To support the creation of these extensions, the Visual Studio
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Software Development Kit
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      SDK
     
    </strong>
    
     ) provides
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker780">
    </a>
    
     all the necessary tools and documentation.
    
    
     The SDK includes libraries, sample code, and comprehensive tutorials designed to help us get started with building our own extensions.
    
    
     This toolkit is essential for navigating the complexities of extension development and ensuring that new tools integrate smoothly with the Visual
    
    
     
      Studio environment.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     With a solid understanding of the foundational components and the supportive ecosystem surrounding Visual Studio extensions, you’re now well equipped to take the next step: building your first extension.
    
    
     In the following section, we’ll go through the process of creating a
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker781">
    </a>
    
     basic Visual Studio extension from scratch, demonstrating how to leverage the tools and resources provided by the Visual Studio SDK to bring your ideas

   <p>
    
     Let’s create a simple
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker782">
    </a>
    
     Visual Studio extension that adds a new menu item under the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Tools
     
    </strong>
    
     menu.
    
    
     When clicked, this menu item will display a message box.
    
    
     This example will guide us through setting up a basic
    
    
     
      extension project.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Before diving into extension development, it’s crucial to set up your environment properly.
    
    
     The first step is to ensure that we have the right tools installed.
    
    
     Begin by opening the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Visual Studio Installer
     
    </strong>
    
     and
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker783">
    </a>
    
     modifying the current Visual Studio installation.
    
    
     Within the installer, we’ll want to check that the Visual Studio extension development workload
    
    
     
      is installed.

      This can be used for syntax highlighting, identifying specific patterns in the code, or even providing real-time feedback on coding standards.
     
     
      For example, we can create a classifier that highlights all to-do comments in a bright color to ensure they catch the

      These margins can display additional information or controls related to the code being viewed.
     
     
      A use case could be implementing a margin that shows a mini-map of the code file, allowing users to quickly navigate through
     
     
      
       large files.

      This can include underlining, strikethroughs, background colors, or even inserting images or icons in line with the text.
     
     
      That allows us to add a red squiggly underline to deprecated methods to visually indicate they should not be used,
     
     
      
       for instance.

       Async Package
      
     </strong>
     
      : This provides a foundation for creating asynchronous operations within Visual Studio extensions.
     
     
      This is particularly useful for operations that may take a significant amount of time to complete, such as fetching data from an external service or performing
     
     
      
       intensive computations.

     Deploying and sharing
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker799">

     Visual Studio extensions with the community is an exciting step in the extension development process.
    
    
     It allows us to contribute to the ecosystem, potentially improving the development experience for thousands of Visual Studio users worldwide.
    
    
     In this section, we will walk through a comprehensive guide on deploying and sharing our extensions, including signing your VSIX (a
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      .vsix
     
    </strong>
    
     file contains one or more Visual Studio extensions) packages for added security
    
    
     
      and trustworthiness.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Once we ensure it is thoroughly tested and ready for public release, we can start the deploying phase.
    
    
     This includes testing across different versions of Visual Studio, handling edge cases, and ensuring compatibility with various project types
    
    
     
      and configurations.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     First, in order to prevent tampering and build trust with the end user, we sign our VSIX with
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Sign CLI
     
    </strong>

     tag when we need to get
    
    
     
      the latest:
     
    
   </p>
   <pre class="source-code">
dotnet tool install sign --prerelease –global</pre>
   <p>
    
     Once installed, Sign CLI could be accessed in a Developer PowerShell instance using
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      sign code &lt;command&gt; &lt;option&gt;

   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     
      First, create a publisher account on Visual
     
     
      
       Studio Marketplace.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Sign in with your Microsoft account and follow the prompts to set up your publisher profile if you haven’t done so already.

       https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/createpublisher?managePageRedirect=true
      
     </a>
     
      ).
     
     
      Here, you’ll need to provide essential details about your extension, including the title, description, and relevant visuals, such as an icon and screenshots.
     
     
      These elements help potential users understand what your
     
     
      
       extension offers.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Once we’ve filled out the details, upload your signed VSIX package.
     
     
      Visual Studio Marketplace will automatically validate the package and its digital signature, ensuring everything is in order
     
     
      
       before proceeding.
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      After uploading, submit your extension for review.
     
     
      Microsoft will carefully evaluate your submission to ensure it adheres to the Marketplace’s policies
     
     
      
       and guidelines.
      
     
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    
     This review process is crucial for maintaining the quality and security of the extensions available
    
    
     
      to users.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Finally, upon approval, your extension will be published on Visual Studio Marketplace.
    
    
     It will then be available for installation directly through the Visual Studio IDE or as a download from the
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker803">
