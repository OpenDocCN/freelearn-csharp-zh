    (**ERP**) and **Customer Relationship Management** (**CRM**) solutions, isn't
    solely about technology. Experience tells that it is as much about the people
    and processes as it is about the software. Software is only the enabler, with
    the key to success lying in developing an organizational solution strategy to
    fit the near-term and long-term goals of the company, matching the needs to appropriate
    solutions, and then managing the implementation to meet the set goals.

- en: When organizations think of ERP and CRM systems, they typically think of core
    financials and bookkeeping functions or the basic customer contact management
    activities. While these systems certainly can and do support those functions,
    it is also important to understand the capabilities that the modern-day versions
    of these solutions are starting to provide to companies and their user base. These
    systems have evolved well beyond these basic foundations, encompassing multiple
    functional, departmental, and cross-functional needs of the organizations. Current
    generation business solutions are capable of providing composite applications
    that support areas including product engineering, sales force automation, marketing
    automation, customer care, sales order management, supplier relationship management,
    supply chain planning, order fulfillment and logistics, and after-sales service

    and users have minimal or no access to, nor a need for, the technical infrastructure.
    More and more providers, including Microsoft, are giving customers both online
    and on-premises options for end-to-end or specific point solutions, thereby allowing
    the customers to be able to leverage the Two-Tier approach as a means to gradually
    shift their technology to the cloud. Companies can either chose to move to the
    cloud the applications to support one or more of their subsidiaries, or they may
    choose to move a specific function such as **Expense Reporting** or **Indirect

    within a function such as supplier relationship management, supply chain management,
    human capital management, or sales, marketing, or customer service. In as much,
    a workload can encompass both **ERP and CRM workloads**. A workload can also address
    the operational requirements of a vertical function of an organization, such as
    its manufacturing or retail operations. Essentially, the workload approach decomposes
    the system into multiple blocks, allowing companies to select those blocks that
    specifically fit their needs, and also giving them the ability to sequence the
    deployment of the blocks in a timeline that is most appropriate to their immediate
    and long-term business goals and user needs. The workload approach also enables
    shorter and less expensive implementation cycles.

    the social aspect seems to be just as important for intra-office communications.
    Yet, a company could certainly function for a foreseeable period without e-mails—people
    may actually have to resort to what now seems to be an archaic form of communication
    and pick up a phone to talk to other parties. As humorous as it may seem, it wouldn't
    be far from reality, and some employees would argue that their efficiencies may

    solutions. Any solution will have a range of complexity, from a quick, rapid deployment,
    to a longer, complex solution development and deployment. The point of emphasis

    goes beyond that to help customers with their selection process, such a method
    can be of the utmost value to the customer. This is important from the sellers'
    perspective as well—given the criticality, customers go through the due diligence
    in selecting their solution provider or implementer as they do on the business
    application itself. If the solution provider offers to the customers a methodology
    that will help them select the right solution to meet their needs and then deliver

    components (hardware and any third-party software), as well as the release schedule
    (overall plan with resource needs from both the consulting and customer organization).

    and temporary character of our endeavor. Projects are temporary by definition,

    the start date of our project; the end date can be more of a worry and is often
    confused with the Go-Live date of the brand new software solution. Projects are
    also unique by nature—not only because they produce unique deliverables, but also
    because the context for the execution is unique. Unique can mean that it has never
    been done before, or maybe it has been done in a very similar fashion before but
    never exactly in the same way. Therefore, no two projects, by definition, can

    demands for specific deliverables such as internal reports and customized functionality,
    matching their unique organization of the business processes. But even more important
    to note is the fact that people make these implementations unique. Implementing
    the solution in a customer context is always unique because we are always working
    with different people. They always have a different background, knowledge level,
    expectations, goals, and their own unique way of working. We also work with changing
    consulting implementation teams, based on the availability of our consultants,
    resulting in a unique context. So yes, the Microsoft Dynamics implementations
    are projects because they are unique and they are meant to be temporary. We always
    need to deliver our projects in a limited timeframe and no two engagements are
    the same. However, this involves a lot of uncertainty and so our Microsoft Dynamics
    engagements are characterized by uncertainty going hand in hand with risk (in
    ISO 31000:2009 risk is defined as the effect of uncertainty on objectives).

    environments. We may know some of our key users, but we may not know all the key

    TEC believes that it is essential for corporate management to be actively involved
    in the system selection decision by naming an executive sponsor who participates

- en: Ensuring the participation of a cross-functional team is another key to success
    noted by TEC. A team comprised of all the functional divisions and management
    levels within the organization facilitates active ownership of the project by
    the entire user community. This also ensures that the implementation team will
    be able to reflect the requirements of the users, thereby maximizing the value

- en: This chapter serves as an introduction to the rest of the book. We began with
    a discussion of the needs and priorities of the business solutions market. We
    then explained how, depending on the usage scenario, CRM and ERP solutions can
    be mission critical to the customer organizations. This criticality underscores
    the need for a dependable approach for selecting the right solution to meet the
    customer's needs, a method that builds on the knowledge gained in the envisioning
    stage to deliver a solution that meets the requirements. We also introduced Microsoft
    Dynamics Sure Step as a methodology that has been designed to fulfill these needs.
