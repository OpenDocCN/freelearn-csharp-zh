<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">This chapter explains what can be done to make IT a real industry, and this begins with applying the main principles of industrialization, namely cutting complexity into small pieces and then standardizing the modules, and in particular their interfaces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">We will make a comparison with the development of cities, where the normalization of water pipes, electricity, and other interfaces has allowed for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">continuous evolution.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">In this chapter, we will explain the very concept of industry, as this is a very often used name, but not necessarily every time with a precise understanding of its meaning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">We will also learn about how industrialization works by cutting complex problems into small ones and then making the small ones simple and repeatable, principally by means of standardization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">We’ll also understand what benefits can be drawn from such an approach, in particular in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">information systems.</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">What is an industry?</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">In the previous </span><a id="_idIndexMarker046"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">chapter, we compared craftsmanship to industrialization, hopefully showing that, while the former has nothing to be ashamed of, the latter is its natural evolution in time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">All industries start with artisans and, with the work becoming more and more controlled and repeatable, potentially end up as real industries where the artisans have gradually converted to engineer competencies and jobs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">Most people understand this without any need for explanation because it can be seen in many day-to-day experiences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">When one, for example, first attempts at realizing a new task (say, cutting hair), the first trials are not comparable to the ensuing ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.5">After a period of time, the process starts to become more regular (the hair is cut fine, and the initial customer who accepted to be your </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">guinea pig</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1"> does not complain anymore). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Given enough training, one gets expertise in the field and develops a routine (the hair is cut at a defined length and with the expected shape, in a way that can be precisely reproduced in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">future haircut).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">How about </span><a id="_idIndexMarker047"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">trying to formalize what is behind industrialization, though? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">In other terms, how do we characterize what constitutes industrialization? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.3">As we saw, there is the concept of being reproducible, which means there is a measured norm that should be met. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.4">Also, this norm is shared between all knowledgeable people in the field, which means it becomes a standard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.5">In our example with haircuts, there are names for haircuts, and everybody in the field knows what “trimmed” or “shortened” means, which makes it safe for customers not to leave the hairdresser with a hairstyle they did not expect. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.6">Also, from one hairdresser to another, one can expect to obtain a globally similar result once stated using the right vocabulary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.7">We obtain a homogeneous quality in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">this way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">In industrialization, just like in hairdressing, there is also the concept of addressing small parts of the whole. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">Except if you would like to look like a well-known person, you will not describe your haircut as a whole but describe small parts that form a complete hairstyle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">For example (although not a good one, from an aesthetic point of view): long at the back, short on the top, tapered on the side. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.4">Addressing the parts instead of the whole and cutting a complex problem into small, simple ones that can be solved simply is the basis for industrialization, engineering, and even problem-solving as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">a whole.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">A good hairdresser may be a fine artisan, but once you can get a similar haircut from many professionals in the field, it has simply become an </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">industry</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">In the following sections, we will apply this definition to IT and show how industrialization happens there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">In order to do so, we will first dive a bit deeper into what really stands behind the concept, in terms of actions </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">to realize</span><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">The two roots of industrialization – modularization and standardization</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">After a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker048"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">simple example as an introduction to what we are going to call industrialization when applying it to Information Technology, we are going to dive a bit deeper into two associated movements in the concept, namely cutting big problems into small ones, which can be called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">modularization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1"> (as we expect small </span><a id="_idIndexMarker049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">modules of a whole system) and solving these small problems with a normalized approach to reach homogeneous quality, which can be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">called </span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">standardizati</span><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">on</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Modularity to reduce complexity</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Before explaining the concept of complexity, let’s see with another example how it relates to modularity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">This time, we will use a mechanical comparison by analyzing the different modules of a car. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">A modern car is a feat of engineering, gathering so many parts in a sophisticated manner that is it virtually impossible for a person alone to build such a system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.4">When one decomposes a car into modules, there are definitely clear-cut, well-separated modules that each have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">a purpose:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">The engine will provide power to displace </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">the car</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">The body will protect the driver </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">and passengers</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">The wheels and driving train will transform power </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">into motion</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">The chassis will hold the other modules together in a rigid way, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">so on</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">The engine alone still is quite a beast, but we can decompose it further, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">into sub-modules:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">The injection system will bring gas into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">the chamber</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">The pistons will transform the explosion into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">linear motion</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">The crankshaft will convert linear motion into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">rotary motion</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">The lubrication system will ensure the system does not degrade due to wearing, heating, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">so on</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Again, the complexity has lowered, and, if we go one step further into decomposing modules, the lubrication system can be described as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">A pump ensures </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">oil circulation</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">The oil performs cooling and allows for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">frictionless movements</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">The oil filter removes small debris that could otherwise increase friction and wear, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">so on</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">This time, we </span><a id="_idIndexMarker050"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">have reached such a small level of complexity that almost anyone could act on these modules: adding oil can be done by anyone owning a car, provided they know where to pour it; replacing an oil filter is as simple as unscrewing the old one and screwing a new one into the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">same place.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Modularity, really, is the art of cutting complex things into small parts that are easier to manage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">If modularization is done well, complexity decreases at each step. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">Imagine we had separated the engine as left and right portions of it: we surely would not have made it easier to observe and maintain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.4">Indeed, modularity is not simply the cutting of the system; it is the art of cutting it in an intelligent way so that complexity decreases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.5">But how can we do that? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.6">This is where the experience of artisans and the help of a long history of making comes into place, providing enough expertise to know where the system should be and what will make it simpler. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.7">The first engines surely did not have an oil filter, but after some time being obliged to remove all the oil from the engine after a few hundred kilometers, filter it, and pour it back into the engine, it became obvious inserting a filter into the engine oil flow was the clever thing to do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.8">If we try to summarize this in just one sentence, modules should be carved out after functions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.9">The oil filter is there because, in the process of lubrication, there has to be a filtering function. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.10">It does make sense to assign this function to one and only </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">one mod</span><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">ule.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Standardization to ensure modularity is helpful</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker051"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">relationship between the different modules, the way they fit together, and how they interact are other criteria that must be taken into account. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">Cutting down is not enough: if one wants the whole system to function, defining smaller modules is the first step, but once created, they must be put back together to reach the global goal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">This is where the way the modules have been cut is important, and we have explained previously that it should </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">follow functions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">But how about putting them back together? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">If modules are aligned with functions, how can we make sure they fit together well? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.3">In fact, the problem is quite simple to explain and sometimes extremely hard to solve, needing large engineering teams to do so: we have to ensure that the common function they share is exactly the same. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.4">If two functions have to be reassembled, that means they have a small connecting sub-function in common, which is generally called the interface. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.5">This interface has to be defined in a similar pattern on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">both sides.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Let’s take the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker052"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1"> example of our oil filter again: it has been separated from the rest of the lubrication system and engine for its definition, but it also has to be put back in the engine system to operate and participate in the higher level of function, namely providing power to the car. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">To do so, it has been explained the oil filter has to be screwed back to the position in the engine, and this is where an interface will be needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.3">This interface is simply a screw thread: the oil filter will present a threaded oil and the engine a threaded growth at the place where the filter has to be placed, with of course a hole in it, allowing oil to flow in and from the filter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.4">The interface itself is defined </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">with functions:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">It should provide a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">stable attachment</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">It should be tight enough to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">be oil-proof</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">It should allow enough fluid circulation, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">so on</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">We are one step forward, but there remains another step to do in order to reach industrialization: the interface must be standardized, which means all the preceding functions should be specified in such a way that replacement is easy and each provider can participate in the higher-level module simply by knowing the interface. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">In our example, the oil filter, in order to participate in the engine system, has to adhere to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">Use the precise thread diameter (for European oil filters, it is a 20-millimeter diameter, with a thread step of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">1.5 millimeters)</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">Oil-proofness is ensured by a circular joint that is 62 millimeters wide in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">same standard</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">The capacity to retain debris based on fluid circulation, and thus the duration of the filter use, is determined by the volume of the filter, which comes in two standard sizes, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">so on</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">Here is a very low-grade schema of how an oil filter is attached to a car engine: a threaded hole in the oil filter adapts to a threaded piece of metal with a hole in it that is on the external part of the engine, for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">easy access:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">To take another example that is more associated with our day-to-day experience, small batteries, and chargers are currently the target of a push to standardization by governments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">This is particularly visible in the European Community, where USB-C has been pushed down the throat even to massive opponents such as Apple. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">Large companies have been using many different non-compatible connectors and chargers for decades, leading to a huge waste of electronic systems and complexity in the everyday lives of the users, forcing them to juggle many different pieces of equipment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.4">This law is already having some results in making charging a phone less complex for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">the public.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">The concept of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker056"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">complexity was introduced previously when talking about how to reduce it by cutting large, difficult-to-operate systems into small ones that are easier to deal with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">In</span><a id="_idIndexMarker057"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1"> this section, we will come back to this concept of complexity and start by stating that there are two kinds of complexity, namely the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">intrinsic</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">, functional one and the avoidable, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">accidental</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1"> one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">The first one comes from the function itself, and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker058"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">if a module is to provide this function, it cannot do less than this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">The second one is everything that is added when implementing the function to make it operate, and that cannot be considered as purely necessary for the function itself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">Of course, the whole deal will be to reduce as much as possible the second one, since the two add up and the first one cannot be reduced </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">by definition.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">In our example of an oil filter for a car engine, the folding of the absorbing paper inside the filter is intrinsic complexity, because the different stacks of paper and how they form a complex path for the oil are the way the filter functions, retaining the heavy metal particles in the foldings of paper, while the oil reaches the output of the filter with cleaner, purer characteristics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">The metal casing of the filter, really, cannot be considered as a participant in the filtering operation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.3">Sure – it is helpful to hold the paper sheets together and facilitate manipulation, but it does not participate in filtering: this is accidental complexity in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">oil filter.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">A lot of work currently done by computers today is of a high level of technical complexity: displaying high-resolution real-time pictures from 3D modeling in games, performing long calculations such as discrete Fourier transforms or Monte Carlo simulations, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">Lots of these operations could not be realized with the same level of accuracy and low error level by humans or even large groups of them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.3">Thus, we can consider IT has helped </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">reduce</span><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1"> complexity.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">It just happens that, along with the capacity of computers, we have asked them to do more and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">And while some of these additional operations are bringing new value (optimization of mechanical models, capacity to simulate complex physical models, and so on), a lot are non-value-adding features (larger screens, infinity of nuances of colors) that really make for additional</span><a id="_idIndexMarker061"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1"> comfort but, in </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">line-of-business</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">LOB</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">) software applications, do not bring anything to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">functional value.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">Luckily, there </span><a id="_idIndexMarker062"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">is also good news on the evolution of information systems, and the “as a service” approach is one such example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.2">The “as a service” approach means that something of value is provided to the user without the material part. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">Infrastructure as a service</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">IaaS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">), for example, brings you memory and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker063"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">CPU without the hardware part of the computer; that is dealt with by someone else, generally the cloud provider. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">Software as a service</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">SaaS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">) provides </span><a id="_idIndexMarker064"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">you with working software that you can call with a simple web browser without having to worry about prerequisites, installation, purchase of licenses, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">so on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">If we consider this approach with respect to the concepts of complexity exposed previously, we can say that the goal is to reduce accidental complexity to almost zero by providing not even the function alone but only the results of the function, which is the service requested. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">If almost nothing of the surrounding artifacts remains; only the outcome of the software-assisted procedure is obtained. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.3">For example, in IaaS, infrastructure as a whole is not what is needed per se by the buyer: one does not crave physical computers consuming space, needing local temperature control, racks, and so on, but has to go through this accidental complexity to obtain CPU power, RAM usage, storage space, or network bandwidth </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">and connectivity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">The “as a service” concept has considerably diminished the perceived complexity of information systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">Of course, there is no free lunch, and the overall complexity is still there (it has even increased). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.3">But the separation, not modules by modules this time, but functions by functions, has established a clear cut between the high technical complexity that is handled by the provider of the service and the low complexity that remains for the user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.4">The financial transfer from the latter to the former is explained by the fact that the user gets a great advantage of focusing only on value-adding, business-oriented complexity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.5">How the provider of the service gains a financial interest in handling higher technical complexity (which would be accidental for a mere user, but is standard business complexity for the provider) comes from the fact that they are an expert in it, handle large volumes for many users, and apply scale-related cost savings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.6">In the end, everyone benefits from a clear cut of complexity, which can also be described as a separation of responsibility and task specialization, which is consubstantial with industrialization, as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">expl</span><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">ained previously.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">It has been studied a lot and is a great description of the concept of the evolution of a software application from MVP (the skateboard) to a full-fledged project (the car on the right). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">Lots of imitations do not carry as much meaning because they miss a few details. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.3">For example, some of them end up with the same car on the two lines, which is completely wrong as Kniberg purposefully showed different cars at the end of the two processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.4">The whole story is perfectly explained at </span><a href="https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">, and I am certainly not going to paraphrase it, but rather try to make a link with what was written previously about the “as a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">service” approach.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">What is the service that is talked about in that famous picture? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">Does it have a car? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">No – owning a car or driving it is merely a side-effect on the service itself, which is “going from one point to another.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.4">Using an MVP will help us collect feedback as quickly as possible on the actual needs of the users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.5">Now, if we go to the extreme of the “as a service” approach and consider displacement of the person (and possible luggage) as the one and only request, science-fiction-like teleportation would be absolutely perfect! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.6">And we are a bit more reasonable with possibility and price; as Kniberg says, maybe the most basic approach should be to provide the user with a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">bus ticket.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">This would also be a valuable MVP, but that would be forgetting the fact that an MVP does not mean the designer does not have the final destination in mind: we provide the skateboard to collect feedback (for example, “stability is important”) while still having in mind that we want a car in the end, maybe because the initially expressed need is that of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">autonomous travel.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">What is of uttermost importance – and we will come back to why the cars are not the same in the end – is that, while taking into account feedback, stability was important in this example and the design quickly evolved to a bike, which is more stable and easier to stay on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">But </span><a id="_idIndexMarker067"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">this is not the only feedback that was received. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">For example, the fact that the vehicle was not covered was not really an issue, and the design evolved into a bike and then a motorbike, which has no wind or rain protection. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.3">In the end, the proposed car has no roof: not only because it is simply not requested, but because the interest in driving with hair in the wind may have arisen from the feedback loop. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.4">If one had created the car directly, maybe the customer would not have thought of an open roof. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.5">But asking for continuous feedback has shown an additional desirable feature (not a need, though, but just a “bonus”) that would have not been </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">detected otherwise.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">This is what companies talk about when they express their desire to “delight their customers.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">Most of us engineers do not immediately get it because we tend to see problems with one optimized solution that derives from initial specifications, but the best solutions bring value to customers that they would not even have thought about initially. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.3">And guess what? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.4">Since all companies are generally good at creating the expected features, these unexpected and delightful features will be the ones your customers will use to differentiate your service from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">your competitors!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">Now that the concept of complexity should be clear, we will propose a first approach </span><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">to how to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">reduce it.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">Until the 1950s, freight transportation was not standardized at all, and filling a ship with freight was quite a craftsmanship: packages came in all sizes and weights, some of them being soft, some of them being hard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.2">The way to bind them together so that they did not move during transportation was customized at every different shipping. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.3">It was extremely hard to correctly fill a vehicle since there was little chance all packages would fit nicely to occupy all space while keeping fragile and lightweight packages at the top and heavy, solid ones at the bottom. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.4">If you then add the problems of load balance, humidity, or temperature effects that could transmit from one package to another, and the occasional last-minute package that was too heavy to put on top of the other ones and forced the dockers to unload part of the shipment and rearrange everything, you start to get an understanding of what a complicated job freight shipping was at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">that time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">Meet Malcolm McLean, who devised in 1956 a shipping system based on wood boxes that could be easily transferred from trucks to trains and boats. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.2">After only 10 years, in 1967, this great idea was used so much that the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">International Organization for Standardization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">ISO</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">) defined </span><a id="_idIndexMarker070"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">three standard sizes of “containers.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.2">Despite road/train/sea transportation activities being a huge, worldwide business, after only a few decades, virtually every operator on earth uses standard-sized metal containers that allow optimization of the whole logistics chain </span><a id="_idIndexMarker071"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">and have the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">following benefits:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">Ease of loading</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">: Any expediter can get their hands on a container and load it at their own rhythm, then contact a transporter and have them carry the container, without any risk of refuse because they cannot take care of a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">particular shape.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">Improvement in the handling of goods</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">: Since the metal boxes have standardized sizes and corners with handling holes, there is no use anymore in changing manipulation tools that are needed to press the package (and potentially break its content). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.2">Now, the prehensile tools simply lock the four corners</span><a id="_idIndexMarker072"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1"> of the container and lift them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">The speed of handling is also improved as there is no need to handle different packages one by one: the machines lift a container – that carries many different packages inside – as a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">single unit.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">Optimized storage</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">: Industrial containers are plain, parallelepiped-shaped boxes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">Their stacking wastes almost no place but the width of the walls. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.3">Today, large ships are sized around containers for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">size optimization.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">Interchangeable material</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">: Containers have become such commodities that there is almost no question of property. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">A container can be easily repaired or replaced by another. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.3">A container basically never travels empty. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.4">Some of them have traveled several times around the world without their initial buyer seeing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">them again.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">The Docker name and logo clearly state the philosophy behind the technology: the term </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">docker</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1"> refers to the job of loading freight on ships, and Docker’s logo shows a whale carrying containers on its back. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">The link is quite obvious to the transportation business, and the company wants to become the equivalent of industrial containers for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">application shipping.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">Just as with industrial shipping containers, Docker containers provide </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">standard-based advantages:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">Whatever is inside the container (Java process, .NET web, Python script, NodeJS API, and so on), the external interface is exactly the same, and one can simply type </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">docker run</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1"> and have the container up </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">and running.</span></span></li>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">Independence from the underlying architecture</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">: Docker containers do not know or care whether they are operated on a Windows machine, a Linux server, or even a Kubernetes cluster. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.2">Since they have a standard size, they can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">fit anywhere.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">With all these nice features, Docker quickly became the de facto standard for application </span><a id="_idIndexMarker073"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1">deployment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">Docker itself could even have become the definitive standard, but there were a few shortcomings, and a higher-level, more widespread standard appeared a few years later: </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">Open Container Initiative</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">OCI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">) created a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker074"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">low-denominator, but undeniable standard that every container technology (Docker, but also other technologies, though less known) </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">adheres to.</span></span></p>
