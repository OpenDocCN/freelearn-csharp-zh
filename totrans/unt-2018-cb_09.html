                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since Unity 4.6 in 2014, Unity has shipped with dedicated 2D features, and Unity 2018 continues to build on these. In this chapter, we present a range of recipes to introduce the basics of 2D animation in Unity 2018, and help you understand the relationships between the different animation elements.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The Big picture</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In Unity 2D, animations can be created in several different ways—one way is to create many images, each slightly different, which frame-by-frame give the appearance of movement. A second way to create animations is by defining keyframe positions for individual parts of an object (for example, the arms, legs, feet, head, and eyes), and getting Unity to calculate all the in-between positions when the game is running:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/14375113-9416-4625-868a-71ac9dab7360.png"/></p>
<p>Both sources of animations become Animation Clips in the Animation panel. Each Animation Clip then becomes a State in the Animator Controller State Machine. We can also duplicate States based on Animation Clips, or create new States, and add scripted Behaviors.</p>
<p>We also can define sophisticated Conditions, under which GameObject will Transition from one animation State to another.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Grids, Tilemaps, and Tile Palettes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Unity has introduced a set of Tile features that makes creating Tile-based <strong>Scenes</strong> quick and easy. A Tile Grid GameObject acts as the parent to Tilemaps. Tilemaps are the GameObjects onto which Tiles are painted, from the Tile Palette panel. Sprites can be made into Tile assets, and a collection of Tiles can be added to form a Tile Palette from which to paint a Scene.</p>
<p>It also offers powerful, scripted Rule Tiles that enhance the Tile brush tools, automatically adding top, left, right, and bottom edge Tiles as more Grid elements are painted with Tiles. Rule Tiles can even randomly choose from a selection of Tiles under defined conditions.

                    <h1 class="header-title">The 2D GameKit – bringing 2D tools together</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Perhaps the most exciting 2D feature introduced by Unity is the 2D GameKit. This brings together several powerful Unity features for constructing 2D games, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tilemaps and Rule Tiles</li>
<li>Character Controller 2D (and Input Mapper and Player Character components)</li>
<li>Cinemachine intelligent camera control</li>
<li>The Unity event system</li>
<li>Many prefabricated common 2D game components, including doors, teleporters, dialog panels, switches, inventory, melee, collectables and inventory, damageables, and enemies and much more</li>
</ul>
<p>The final recipe in this chapter introduces the 2D GameKit, and the other recipes in this chapter, and some others, introduce some of the components individually, so that you'll know enough to start taking your first steps with the 2D GameKit and learning how to build Scenes that tightly combine core 2D game features.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we introduce recipes demonstrating the animation system for 2D game elements. The PotatoMan2D character is from the Unity 2D Platformer, which you can download yourself from the Unity asset store. That project is a good place to see lots more examples of 2D game and animation techniques:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Flipping a sprite horizontally – the DIY approach</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Perhaps the simplest 2D animation is a simple flip, from facing left to facing right, or facing up to facing down, and so on. In this recipe, we'll add a cute bug sprite to the scene, and write a short script to flip its horizontal direction when the <em>Left</em> and <em>Right</em> arrow keys are pressed:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d4160ed3-6d19-4451-ab9c-09534dbce803.png" style="width:39.58em;height:6.58em;"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>For this recipe, we have prepared the image you need in a folder named Sprites in folder <kbd>08_01</kbd>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To flip an object horizontally with arrow key presses, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are working in a project that was originally created in 3D, you can change the default project behavior (for example, new Sprite Textures and <strong>Scene</strong> mode) to 2D via menu: Edit | Project Settings | Editor, then choose 2D for the Default Behavior Mode in the Inspector.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/9e5f36aa-c081-4587-8f58-2eadd2776b15.png"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Import the provided image: EnemyBug.png.</li>
<li>Drag an instance of the red Enemy Bug image from the Project | Sprites folder into the <strong>Scene</strong>. Position this GameObject at (0, 0, 0) and scale to (2, 2, 2).</li>
<li>Create a C# script-class named BugFlip, and add an instance-object as a component to the Enemy Bug:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">     using UnityEngine;<br/>     using System.Collections;<br/><br/>     public class BugFlip : MonoBehaviour {<br/>       private bool facingRight = true;<br/><br/>       void Update() {<br/>         if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.LeftArrow) &amp;&amp; facingRight)<br/>           Flip ();<br/>         if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.RightArrow) &amp;&amp; !facingRight)<br/>           Flip();<br/>       }<br/><br/>       void Flip (){<br/>         // Switch the way the player is labelled as facing.<br/>         facingRight = !facingRight;<br/><br/>         // Multiply the player's x local scale by -1.<br/>         Vector3 theScale = transform.localScale;<br/>         theScale.x *= -1;<br/>         transform.localScale = theScale;<br/>       }<br/>     } </pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>When you run your scene, pressing the <em>Left</em> and <em>Right</em> arrow keys should make the bug face left or right.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The C# class defines a <strong>Boolean</strong> variable, <kbd>facingRight</kbd>, that stores a true/false value corresponding to whether or not the bug is facing right. Since our bug sprite is initially facing right, we set the initial value of <kbd>facingRight</kbd> to true to match this.</p>
<p>Every frame, the <kbd>Update()</kbd> method, checks to see whether the <em>Left</em> or <em>Righ</em>t arrow keys have been pressed. If the <em>Left</em> arrow key is pressed and the bug is facing right, then the <kbd>Flip()</kbd> method is called, likewise if the <em>Right</em> arrow key is pressed and the bug is facing left (that is, facing right is false), again the <kbd>Flip()</kbd> method is called.</p>
<p>The <kbd>Flip()</kbd> method performs two actions; the first simply reverses the true/false value in variable <kbd>facingRight</kbd>. The second action changes the +/- sign of the X-value of the <kbd>localScale</kbd> property of the transform. Reversing the sign of the <kbd>localScale</kbd> results in the 2D flip that we desire. Look inside the PlayerControl script for the PotatoMan character in the next recipe – you'll see the same <kbd>Flip()</kbd> method being used.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Flipping a sprite horizontally – using Animator State Chart and Transitions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this recipe, we'll use (in a simple way) the Unity animation system to create two states corresponding to two animation clips, and a script that changes localScale according to which animation state is active. We'll use a second script, which will map the arrow keys press Horizontal input axis values to a Parameter in the state chart, and which will drive the transition from one state to the other.</p>
<p>While it may seem like a lot of work, compared to the previous recipe, such an approach illustrates how we can map from input events (such as key presses or touch inputs), to Parameters and Triggers in a State Chart.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>For this recipe, we have prepared the image you need in a folder named Sprites in folder <kbd>08_02</kbd>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To flip an object horizontally using Animator State Chart and Transitions, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>Import the provided image: EnemyBug.png.</li>
<li>Drag an instance of the red Enemy Bug image from the Project | Sprites folder into the scene. Position this GameObject at (0, 0, 0) and scale to (2, 2, 2).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>With the Enemy Bug GameObject selected in <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, open the <strong>Animation</strong> panel (menu: Window | Animation | Animation), and click the Create button to create a new Animation Clip asset. Save the new Animation Clip asset as beetle-right. You will also see that an Animator component has been added to the Enemy Bug GameObject:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/12056ee9-9a17-40cc-9a19-abdaa840bcd8.png"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>If you look at the Project panel, you'll see two new asset files have been created: the beetle-right Animation Clip and an Animator Controller named Enemy Bug:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/97d8c5f0-3af0-4a8e-bac4-c8d7c22c2ce9.png" style="width:27.33em;height:9.25em;"/></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Close the <strong>Anim</strong><strong>ation</strong> panel, and double click the Enemy Bug Animator Controller to start editing it – it should appear in a new <strong>Animator</strong> panel. You should see four <em>states</em>, Any State and Exit are unlinked, and state Entry has a Transition arrow connecting to Animation Clipbeetle-right. This means that as soon as the Animator Controller starts to play, it will enter the beetle-right state. State beetle-right is tinted orange, to indicate that it is the Default state.</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/f693e4b9-b9ea-4c36-a2f1-4f0eca72820c.png"/></p>
<p>If there is only one Animation Clip state, that will be the Default state automatically. Once you have other states added to the state chart, you can right-click a different state and use the context menu to change which state is first entered.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Select the beetle-right state and make a copy of it, renaming the copy beetle-left (use can use the right-mouse menu, or the <em>Ctrl </em>+ <em>C</em>/<em>V</em> keyboard shortcuts). It makes sense to position beetle-left to the <strong>left</strong> of beetle-right:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/e33b61f7-78f9-4bad-8b99-029631dba86b.png"/></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Move your mouse pointer over the beetle-right state, and then in the mouse right-click context menu, choose Make Transition, and drag the white arrow that appears into the beetle-left state:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/11b92799-25b0-4c1c-8a8e-e5c3cb831f7b.png"/></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Repeat this step with beetle-left, to create a Transition back from beetle-left to beetle-right:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/fecdc29d-4aba-4077-9cd9-a11564a044e6.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="10">
<li>We want an instance Transition between left- and right-facing. So for <strong>each </strong>Transition, uncheck the Has Exit Time option. Click the Transition arrow to select it (it should turn blue), then uncheck this option in the <strong>Inspector</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/7b6c0e69-a37b-44e4-92ce-f29079c797e9.png"/></p>
<p>To delete a Transition, first select it, then use the <em>Delete</em> key (<strong>Windows</strong>) or press <em>Fn</em> + <em>Backspace</em> (<strong>macOS</strong>).</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>For our condition to decide when to change the active state, we now need to create a Parameter indicating whether the <em>Left/Right</em> arrow keys have been clicked. <em>Left/Right</em> keys presses are indicated by the Unity input system's Horizontal axis value. Create a state chart float Parameter named axisHorizontal by selecting Parameters (rather than Layers) in the top-left of the <strong>Animator</strong> panel, clicking the plus-symbol "+" button, and choosing Float. Name your new <strong>Parameter</strong> axisHorizontal:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/b355d388-26fb-4984-a403-9f2e1a622538.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="12">
<li>With our Parameter, we can define the conditions for changing between the left- and right-facing states. When the <em>Left</em> arrow key is pressed, the Unity input system's Horizontal axis value is negative, so select the Transition from beetle-right to beetle-left, and in the <strong>Inspector</strong> click the plus symbol in the Conditions section of the Transition properties. Since there is only one Parameter, this will automatically be suggested, with defaults of Greater than zero. Change the Greater to Less, and we have our desired condition:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ea709f84-2591-43b9-81f8-9d268d9d106f.png"/></p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Now, select the Transition from beetle-left to beetle-right, and add a Condition. In this case, the defaults, axisHorizontal Greater than zero, are just what we want (since a positive value is returned by Unity's input system Horizontal axis when the <em>Right</em> arrow key is pressed).</li>
<li>We need a method to actually map from the Unity input system's Horizontal axis value (from the <em>Left/Right</em> array keys) to our Animator state chart ParameteraxisHorizontal. This we can do with a short script class, which we'll create in the next steps.</li>
<li>Create a C# script class named InputMapper, and add an instance object as a component to the Enemy Bug GameObject:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">    using UnityEngine;<br/><br/>    public class InputMapper : MonoBehaviour {<br/>         Animator animator;<br/><br/>         void Start() {<br/>             animator = GetComponent&lt;Animator&gt;();<br/>         }<br/><br/>         void Update() {<br/>             animator.SetFloat("axisHorizontal", Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal"));<br/>         }<br/>     } </pre>
<ol start="16">
<li>Now we need to actually change the local scale property of the GameObject when we switch to the left or right facing state. Create a C# script class named LocalScaleSetter:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">    using UnityEngine;<br/><br/>     public class LocalScaleSetter : StateMachineBehaviour  {<br/>         public Vector3 scale = Vector3.one;<br/><br/>         override public void OnStateEnter(Animator animator, AnimatorStateInfo stateInfo, int layerIndex) {<br/>             animator.transform.localScale = scale;<br/>         }<br/><br/>     } </pre>
<ol start="17">
<li>In the Animator panel, select the beetle-right state. In the <strong>Inspector</strong>, click the AddBehaviour button, and select LocalScaleSetter. The default public Vector three scale value of (1,1,1) is fine for this state.</li>
<li>In the Animator panel, select the beetle-left state. In the Inspector, click the AddBehaviour button, and select LocalScaleSetter. Change the public Vector three scale to a value of (-1,1,1) – that is, we need to swap the X-scaling to make our Sprite face to the left:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/dc5ab0e9-9da3-4c3e-a614-1cfb885d6f34.png"/></p>
<p>Adding instance objects of C# script classes to Animator states is a great way to link the logic for actions when entering into/exiting a state with the Animator states themselves.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>In the Animator panel, select the beetle-right state. In the Inspector, click the AddBehaviour button, and select InputMapper.</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Each frame the <kbd>Update()</kbd> method of the <kbd>InputMapper</kbd> C# script-class reads the Unity input system's Horizontal axis value each frame, and sets the Animator state chart ParameteraxisHorizontal to this value. If the value is less than (left arrow) or greater than (right arrow) zero, if appropriate, the Animator state system will switch to the other state.</p>
<p>The LocalScaleSetter C# script class actually changes the localScale property (initial value 1,1,1, or reflect horizontally to make it face left -1,1,1). For each state the public <strong>Vector3</strong> variable can be customized to the appropriate values.</p>
<p>The <kbd>OnStateEnter(...)</kbd> method is involved each time you enter the state that an instance object of this C# class is attached to. You can read about the various event messages for the StateMachineBehaviour class at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/StateMachineBehaviour.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/StateMachineBehaviour.html</a>.</p>
<p>When we press the <em>Left</em>-arrow key, the value of the Unity input system's Horizontal axis value is negative, and this is mapped to the Animator state chart, Parameter axisHorizontal, causing the system to Transition to the beetle-left state, and <kbd>OnStateEnter(...)</kbd> of the <strong>LocalScaleSetter</strong> script class instance to be executed, setting the local scale to <strong>(-1, 1, 1</strong>), making the <strong>Texture</strong> flip <strong>Horizontally</strong>, so the beetle faces left.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Instantaneous swapping</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You may have noticed a delay, even though we set Exit Time to zero. This is because there is a default blending when Transitioning from one state to another. However, this can be set to zero, so that the state machine switches instantaneously from one state to the next.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select each Transition in the <strong>Animator</strong> panel.</li>
<li>Expand the Settings properties.</li>
<li>Zero both the Transition Duration and the Transition Offset:</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You have added an Animation Controller State Machine to the hero GameObject. The two Animation Clips you created (idle and jump) appear as States in the <strong>Animator</strong> panel. You created a Transition from Idle to Jump when the JumpTrigger parameter is received by the State Machine. You created a second Transition, which transitions back to the Idle state after waiting 0.5 seconds (the same duration between the 2 key-frames in our Jump Animation Clip).</p>
<p>The player makes the character jump by pressing the <em>Space</em> key. This causes code in the <kbd>PlayerControl</kbd> C#-scripted component of the hero GameObject to be invoked, that makes the sprite move upwards on screen, and also sends a <kbd>SetTrigger(...)</kbd> message to the Animator controller component, for the Trigger named Jump.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The difference between a Boolean Parameter and a Trigger is that a Trigger is temporality set to True and once the <kbd>SetTrigger(...)</kbd> event has been consumed by a state transition, it automatically returns to being False. So Triggers are useful for actions we wish to do once and then revert to a previous state. A Boolean Parameter is a variable, which can have its value set to True or False at different times during the game, and so different Transitions can be created to fire depending on the value of the variable at any time. Note that Boolean Parameters have to have their values explicitly set back to False with <kbd>SetBool(...)</kbd>.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The following screenshot highlights the line of code that sends the <kbd>SetTrigger(...)</kbd> message:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/b78d2caa-e14b-4bcc-9d8d-71b1e841aa25.png" style="width:34.58em;height:11.17em;"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">State Machines for animations of a range of motions (running/walking/jumping/falling/dying) will have more States and Transitions. The Unity-provided potato-man hero character has a more complex State Machine, and more complex animations (of hands and feet, and eyes and hat, and so on, for each Animation Clip), which you may find useful to explore.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">To create a continually-moving animated platform, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag an instance of the platformWoodBlocks sprite from the Project | Sprites folder into the <strong>Scene</strong>. Position this GameObject at (-4, -5, 0), so that these wood blocks are neatly to the left, and slightly below, the wall blocks platform.</li>
<li>Add a Box Collider 2D component to the platformWoodBlocks GameObject so that the player's character can stand on this platform too. Choose menu: Add Component | Physics 2D | Box Collider 2D.</li>
<li>Create a new folder named Animations, in which to store the Animation Clip and controller we'll create next.</li>
<li>Ensuring the platformWoodBlocks GameObject is still selected in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, open an <strong>Animation</strong> panel, and ensure it is in Dope Sheet view (this is the default).</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Animation</strong> panel's Create button, and save the new clip in your new Animation folder, naming it platform-wood-moving-up-down.</li>
<li>Click the Add Property button, choose Transform, and the click the plus-sign by Position. We are now ready to record changes to the (X, Y, Z) position of the platformWoodBlocks GameObject in this Animation Clip:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/e77cbeb9-d991-49aa-994f-3d944fe7a227.png"/></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>You should now see 2 keyframes at 0.0 and at 1.0. These are indicated by diamonds in the Timeline area in the right-hand section of the <strong>Animation</strong> panel.</li>
<li>We need 3 keyframes, with the new one at <kbd>2:00</kbd> seconds. Click at 2:00 in the Timeline along the top of the Animation panel, so that the red line for the current playhead time is at time 2:00. Then click the diamond + button to create a new keyframe at the current playhead time:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/bc5beb79-2670-47c1-9c6e-98e6c67f2320.png"/></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>The first and third keyframes are fine – they record the current height of the wood platform at Y= -5. We need to make the middle keyframe record the height of the platform at the top of its motion, and Unity in-betweening will do all the rest of the animation work for us.</li>
<li>Select the middle keyframe (at time 1:00), by clicking on the diamond at time 1:00 (they should both turn blue, and the red playhead vertical line should move to 1:00, to indicate the middle keyframe is being edited).</li>
<li>Click the red Record cirle button to start recording changes.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong>, change the Y-position of the platform to 0. You should see that all three X, Y, and Z values have a red background in the <strong>Inspector</strong> – this is to inform you that the values of the Transform component are being recorded in the Animation Clip.</li>
<li>Click the red Record circle button again, to finish recording changes.</li>
<li>Save and run your Scene. The wooden platform should now be animating continuously, moving smoothly up and down the positions we set up.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want the potatoman character to be able to jump when on the moving wooden block, you'll need to select the block GameObject and set its layer to Ground.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You have added an animation to the platformWoodBlocks GameObject. This animation contains three keyframes. A keyframe represents the values of properties of the object at a point in time. The first keyframe stores a Y-value of -4, the second keyframe a Y-value of 0, and the final keyframe -4 again. Unity calculates all the in-between values for us, and the result is a smooth animation of the Y-position of the platform.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">If we wanted to duplicate the moving platform, simply duplicating the platformWoodBlocks GameObject in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> and moving the copy won't work – since when you run the <strong>Scene</strong> each duplicate would be animated back to the location of the original animation frames (that is, all copies would be positioned and moving in the original location).</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The solution is first to create a new, empty GameObject (named movingBlockParent), and then a platformWoodBlocks parent to this GameObject. Now we can duplicate the movingBlockParent GameObject (and its platformWoodBlocks child) to create more moving blocks in our scene that each move relative to where the parent GameObject is located at <strong>Design-Time</strong>.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">In many cases, we don't want an animation to begin until some condition has been met, or some event has occurred. In these cases, a good way to organize the Animator Controller is to have two animation states (clips) and a Trigger on the Transition between the clips. We use code to detect when we want the animation to start playing, and at that time we send the Trigger message to the Animation Controller, causing the Transition to start.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">In this recipe, we'll create a water platform block in our 2D platform game; such blocks will begin to slowly fall down the screen as soon as they have been stepped on, and so the player must keep on moving otherwise they'll fall down the screen with the blocks too! It looks as follows:</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">To construct an animation that only plays once a Trigger has been received, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, create an Empty GameObject named water-block-container, positioned at (2.5, -4, 0). This empty GameObject will allow us to make duplicates of animated Water Blocks that will animate relative to their parent GameObject position.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Drag an instance of the Water Block sprite from the Project | Sprites folder into the scene and child it to the water-block-container GameObject. Ensure the position of your new child Water Block GameObject is (0, 0, 0), so that it appears neatly to right of the wall blocks platform:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/00271829-245c-4049-8d08-667da1aaf94e.png"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add a Box Collider 2D component to the child Water Block GameObject, and set the layer of this GameObject to Ground, so that the player's character can stand and jump on this water block platform.</li>
<li>Ensuring the child Water Block GameObject is selected in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, open an <strong>Animation</strong> panel, then create a new clip named platform-water-up, saving it in your Animations folder.</li>
<li>Create a second Animation Clip, named platform-water-down. Again, click the  Add Property button, chose Transform and Position, and delete the second keyframe at 1:00.</li>
<li>With the first keyframe at 0:00 selected, click the red Record button once to start recording changes, and set the Y-value of the GameObject's Transform Position to -5. Press the red Record button again to stop recording changes. You have now completed the creation of the water-block-down Animation Clip, so you can click the red Record button to stop recording.</li>
<li>You may have noticed that as well as the up/down Animation Clips that you created, another file was created in your Animations folder, an Animator Controller named Water Block. Select this file and open the Animator panel, to see and edit the State Machine diagram:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/358a7bc4-2f68-4a2d-9d1e-308c7507c1d4.png"/></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Currently, although we created 2 Animation Clips (states), only the Up state is ever active. This is because when the scene begins (Entry), the object will immediately go in the platform-water-up state, but since there are no Transition arrows from this state to platform-water-down, at present the Water Block GameObject will always be in its Up state.</li>
<li>Ensure the platform-water-up state is selected (it will have a blue border around it), and create a Transition (arrow) to the platform-water-down state by choosing Make Transition from the mouse-right-click menu.</li>
<li>If you run the Scene now, the default Transition settings are that after 0.75 seconds (default Exit Time), the Water Block will Transition into their Down state. We don't want this – we only want them to animate downwards after the player has walked onto them.</li>
<li>Create a Trigger named Fall, by choosing the Parameters tab in the <strong>Animator</strong> panel, clicking the + button and selecting Trigger, and then selecting Fall.</li>
<li>Do the following to create the transition to wait for our Trigger:
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Animator</strong> panel, select the Transition</li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel, uncheck the Has Exit Time option</li>
<li>Set Transition Duration to 3.0 (so the Water Block slowly Transitions to its Down state over a period of 2 seconds)</li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel, click the + button to add a Condition, which should automatically suggest the only possible Condition Parameter, which is our Trigger Fall:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>An alternative to setting the Transition Duration numerically is to drag the Transition end time to 3:00 seconds in the Animation Timeline offered under the Transition Settings in the <strong>Inspector.</strong></p>
<ol start="13">
<li>We need to add a Collider trigger just above the Water Block, and a C# script class behavior to send the Animator Controller Trigger when the player enters the collider.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="14">
<li>Ensure the child Water Block GameObject is selected, add a (second) 2D Box Collider, with a Y-Offset of 1, and tick its Is Trigger checkbox:</li>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You created a two-state Animator Controller state machine. Each state was an Animation Clip. You created a Transition from the Water Block Up state to its Down state that will take place when the Animator Controller received a Fall Trigger message. You created a Box Collider 2D with a Trigger, so that the scripted WaterBlock component could be detected when the player (tagged Player) enters its collider, and at that point send the Fall Trigger message to make the Water Block GameObject start gently Transitioning into its Down state further down the screen.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The traditional method of animation involved hand-drawing many images, each slightly different, which displayed quickly frame-by-frame to give the appearance of movement. For computer game animation, the term Sprite Sheet is given to the image file that contains one or more sequences of sprite frames. Unity provides tools to break up individual sprite images into large Sprite Sheet files, so that individual frames, or sub-sequences of frames, can be used to create Animation Clips that can become States in Animator Controller State Machines. In this recipe, we'll import and break up an open source monster sprite sheet into three animation clips for Idle, Attack, and Death, which looks as shown:</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Unity's Sprite Editor knows about Sprite Sheets, and once the correct grid size has been entered, it treats the items in each grid square inside the Sprite Sheet image as an individual image, or frame, of the animation. You selected sub-sequences of sprite animation frames and added them into several Animation Clips. You added an Animation Controller to your GameObject, and so each Animation Clip appears as a state in the Animation Controller State Machine.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You can now repeat the process, creating an Animation Clipmonster-attack with frames 8-12, and a third clip monster-death with frames 15-21. You would then create Triggers and Transitions to make the monster GameObject transition into the appropriate states as the game is played.</p>

<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>Import the provided images.</li>
<li>The tile Sprites we've using for this recipe are 128 x 128 pixels. It's important to ensure that we set the pixels per unit to 128, so that our Sprite images will map to a grid of 1 x 1 Unity units. Select all the Sprites in the Project | DesertTilePack | Tile folder, and in the <strong>Inspector</strong> set Pixels per Unit to 128:</li>

<li>Display the <strong>Til</strong><strong>e Palette</strong> panel, by choosing menu: Window | 2D | Tile Palette.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Project</strong> panel, create a new folder named Palettes (this is where you'll save your TilePalette assets).</li>

<li>Let's test our platform <strong>Scene</strong> with a 2D character – we can reuse the potatoman character from Unity's free tutorials. Import the provided PotatoManAssets package into your project.</li>
<li>Let's set up the 2D gravity setting for this project since the size of the potatoman character is big with respect to the platforms. We'll make the character move slowly by having a heavy gravity setting of Y= -60.

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">By having a set of platform Sprites that are all a regular size (128 x 128), it is straightforward to create a Tile Palette from those Sprites, and then to add a Grid and Tilemap to the <strong>Scene</strong>, allowing the Tile Palette brush to paint Tiles into the <strong>Scene</strong>.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You had to set the Sprite pixels per unit to 128, so each Tile maps to a 1 x 1 Unity grid unit.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You added a Tilemap Collider 2D to the Tilemap GameObject, so that characters (such as the potatoman) can interact with the platforms. By adding a Layer Ground, and setting the Tilemap GameObject to this Layer, jumping code in the potatoman character-controller script can test the Layer of the object being stood above, so that the jump action will only be possible when standing on a platform Tile.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Here are some suggestions for enhancing this recipe.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Tile Palettes for objects and walls</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The object Sprites in the Desert free pack are all different sizes, and certainly not consistent with the 128 x 128 Sprite size for the platform Tiles.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">However, if the Sprites for the objects and walls in your game <em>are</em> the same size as your platform Sprites, you can create a Tile Palette for your objects, and paint them into the <strong>Scene</strong> using the Tile Palette brush.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Rule Tiles for intelligent Tile selection</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">If you explore the 2D Extras Pack, or the 2D GameKit (see next recipe), you'll learn about Rule Tiles. These allow you to define rules about the choice of a Tile based on its neighbors. For example, you wouldn't put a platform top Tile immediately on top of another one, so Rule Tiles would place some kind of ground tile to be the Tile under the platform top tile. Rules can ensure the leftmost and rightmost tiles in a group select the Tiles with artwork for the edges, and so on.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">A good introduction to Rule Times can be found in this Unity live training video session: <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/using-rule-tiles-tilemap">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/using-rule-tiles-tilemap</a>.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">A collection of Unity 2D tools has been combined to become the Unity 2D GameKit. In this recipe, we'll create a simple 2D-platformer to explore some of the features offered by the 2D GameKit, including pressure plates, doors, and falling objects damaging enemies:</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">This recipe uses the free Unity Asset Store and Package Manager packages.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">To create a game with the <strong>2D GameKit</strong>, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>Use the Package Manager to install the Cinemachine and Post Processing packages (if these are installed, you'll get errors when downloading the 2D GameKit).</li>
<li>Import 2D GameKit (free from Unity Technologies) from the Asset Store.</li>
<li>Close and then re-open the Unity Editor.</li>
<li>Create a new 2D GameKit<strong>Scene</strong>, by choosing menu: Kit Tools | Create New Scene. You'll then be asked to name the <strong>Scene</strong>, and a new <strong>Scene</strong> asset file will be created in your Project | Assets folder. You'll see there are quite a few special GameObjects in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> of your new <strong>Scene</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/a0a8d52f-4abb-411a-8e38-e5a665a0d5de.png"/></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>As you can see, the new <strong>Scene</strong> starts off containing an animated 2D character (Ellen), and a small platform.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong>, select the Tilemap child of the TilemapGrid GameObject –  we are getting ready to paint some Tiles onto this Tilemap GameObject.</li>
<li>Display the Tile Palette, choose menu: Window | 2D | Tile Palette. Select TilesetGameKit, and click on the green-topped grass platform Tile. Select the Paint with active Brush tool (the <em>paintbrush</em> icon).</li>
<li>Start painting grass-topped platforms onto the <strong>Scene</strong>. This is a Rule Tile, so it cleverly ensures that only the top Tiles in a touching group are painted with the grass-topped Tile. The other touching tiles (left/right/below) are painted with a brown, earthy Tile.</li>
<li>Create a wide, flat area, and then to the right of where Ellen starts, create a very tall wall of earth, too tall for Ellen to jump over.</li>
<li>Add four Spikes between Ellen and the earth wall, so she would get hurt trying to jump over them. Drag instances of the Spikes Prefab from  the 2DGameKit | Prefabs | Environment Project folder.</li>
<li>To make things even harder, add a Chomper enemy between the Spikes and the earth wall! Drag an instance of the Chomper Prefab from the 2DGameKit | Prefabs | Enemies Project folder:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/2c611415-5bd6-4620-a10d-79892271ca6c.png"/></p>
<ol start="13">
<li>We have to give Ellen some way to get past the earth wall that avoids the Spikes and Chomper obstacles. Let's add a Teleporter, to the left of where Ellen starts. Drag an instance of the Teleporter Prefab from the 2DGameKit | Prefabs | Interactables Project folder.</li>
<li>Let's create a destination point for the Teleporter using a custom Sprite. Import the EnemyBug Sprite into this project, and drag an instance from the <strong>Project</strong> panel into the Scene – somewhere to the right of the earth wall.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="15">
<li>Teleporters require a Transition Point component in the GameObject that is to be the destination of the teleportation. Add a Collider 2D to Enemy Bug, choose Add Component | Physics 2D | Box Collider 2D. Check its Is Trigger option.</li>
<li>Add a Transition Point component to Enemy Bug, choose Add Component, search for Transition, and then add Transition Point.</li>
<li>We can now set up the Teleporter. With the Teleporter selected in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, in the <strong>Inspector</strong> for the Transition Point (Script) component, do the following:
<ul>
<li>Transitioning Game Object: Drag Ellen into this slot</li>
<li>Transition Type: Choose Same Scene from the drop-down menu</li>
<li>Destination Transform: Drag Enemy Bug into this Transition Point slot</li>
<li>Transition When: Choose On Trigger Enter from the drop-down menu:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/e4ca9c51-468f-49e7-802a-a2fbf1e431c0.png"/></p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Run the <strong>Scene</strong>. Ellen can safetly avoid the Spikes and Chomper by using the Teleporter.</li>
<li>Let's make it a bit more interesting – having the Teleporter GameObject initially inactive (not visible or able to be interacted with), and adding a switch that Ellen has to hit to make the Teleporter active.</li>
<li>Select the Teleporter GameObject in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, and uncheck its active box at the top-left of the <strong>Inspector</strong> – the GameObject should be invisible, and appear greyed out in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="21">
<li>Add a single-use switch to the game, to the left of where Ellen starts. Drag an instance of the Single Use Switch from the 2DGameKit | Prefabs | Interactables Project folder.</li>
<li>With the Single Use Switch selected in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, in the <strong>Inspector</strong> set the following:
<ul>
<li>Layers: Add Layer Player to the Interactable Layers (so the switch can be enabled by the Player colliding or firing a bullet)</li>
<li>On Enter: Drag Teleporter into a free RunTime Only GameObject Slot, and change the action drop-down menu from No Function to GameObject | Set Active (bool), and then check the checkbox that appears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run the <strong>Scene</strong>. Ellen now has to travel over to the switch, to reveal the Teleporter, which then leads her to safely transport to the Enemy Bug location, beyond the earth wall and away from danger.</li>
</ol>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">We have dipped our toes into the wide range of features of the 2D GameKit. Hopefully this recipe gives you an idea of how to work with the provided Prefabs, and also how to explore how custom artwork can be used, with appropriately-added components to create your own GameObjects using the features of the 2D GameKit.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">If you look at the Ellen 2D character, you'll see some scripted components that manage the character's interaction with the 2D GameKit. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CharacterController 2D: Movement and physics interactions</li>
<li>Player Input: Keyboard/input control mapping, so you can change which keys/controller buttons control movement, jumping, and so on</li>
<li>Player Character: How characters interact with the 2D GameKit, including fighting (melee), damage, and bullet pool</li>
</ul>
