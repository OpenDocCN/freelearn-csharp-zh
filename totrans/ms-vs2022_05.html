   <p>
    <strong class="bold">
     
      MAUI
     
    </strong>
    
     , is a versatile
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker351">
    </a>
    
     framework that enables developers to craft native applications for both mobile and desktop platforms, using C# and XAML.
    
    
     With MAUI, developers can target Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows devices from a unified
    
    
     
      code base.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     This open-source framework builds upon the foundation of Xamarin.Forms, extending its capabilities to cover desktop scenarios while aiming for enhanced performance, flexibility, and the ability to consolidate app logic and UI layout within one
    
    
     
      code base.

     The evolution of cross-platform development
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     Cross-platform development frameworks have revolutionized app development by enabling
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker352">
    </a>
    
     code sharing
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker353">
    </a>
    
     across multiple platforms.
    
    
     Xamarin.Forms, for instance, has empowered companies to share over 95 percent of their code base, maximizing development investments.
    
    
     However, the landscape has evolved, prompting the emergence of frameworks such as MAUI to address previous limitations and adapt to the evolving demands of
    
    
     
      app development.

     What is MAUI?
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     Developed by Microsoft, MAUI is an open source framework designed to facilitate the creation
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker354">
    </a>
    
     of native cross-platform apps using a single code base.
    
    
     It builds upon the foundation of Xamarin.Forms, enriching it with additional features, such as a unified project structure,
    
    
     
      and flexibility.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Leveraging .NET 6, MAUI integrates the latest advancements, performance enhancements, and security updates from the .NET framework, enabling developers to harness the extensive ecosystem of .NET libraries and tools to elevate
    
    
     
      their applications.

   <p>
    
     Some
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker355">
    </a>
    
     of the key features of MAUI are
    
    
     
      as follows:

      : MAUI streamlines project management by consolidating code, resources, and UI elements within a single project structure, reducing complexity, and
     
     
      
       saving time
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong class="bold">

     The architecture of MAUI
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     MAUI adopts a strategy where it leverages the native capabilities of each platform while maintaining
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker356">
    </a>
    
     a single code base.
    
    
     This approach grants developers access to native platform features and UI controls through a unified API, facilitating the delivery of uncompromised user experiences while achieving higher
    
    
     
      code reuse.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     .NET MAUI offers a unified framework for constructing user interfaces across both mobile and
    
    
     
      desktop applications.

   <p>
    
     We can craft .NET MAUI applications on either a PC or a Mac.
    
    
     In our .NET MAUI app, our code will
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker357">
    </a>
    
     primarily interact with the .NET MAUI API.
    
    
     Then, the .NET MAUI subsequently accesses the native platform APIs directly.
    
    
     Moreover, our application code may directly engage with platform APIs
    
    
     
      when necessary.

    <li>
     
      For macOS applications, .NET MAUI taps into Mac Catalyst, a feature provided by Apple.
     
     
      This feature permits iOS apps, constructed using UIkit, to operate on macOS platforms.
     
     
      Additionally, it supports the integration of AppKit and necessary
     
     
      
       platform-specific APIs.

      When it
     
     <a id="_idIndexMarker360">

       Shared
      
     </strong>
     
      project, we find the main page’s XAML file, under
     
     <strong class="source-inline">
      
       MainPage.xaml
      
     </strong>
     
      .
     
     
      This is where we design our
     
     
      
       app’s UI.
      
     
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    
     For our
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker365">
    </a>
    
     example, we will simply build an app, with a button to click on to show a
    
    
     
      text message.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     We will begin by designing the UI.
    
    
     To do that, we open
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      MainPage.xaml
     
    </strong>
    
     in the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Shared
     
    </strong>
    
     project and replace its content with the following
    
    
     
      XAML code:
     
    
   </p>
   <pre class="source-code">
&lt;ContentPage xmlns=»http://schemas.microsoft.com/
             dotnet/2021/maui»
             xmlns:x=»http://schemas.microsoft.com/
             winfx/2009/xaml»
             x:Class="MyMauiApp.MainPage"&gt;
    &lt;StackLayout&gt;
        &lt;Button x:Name="MyButton"
                Text="Click Me"
                Clicked="OnButtonClicked"/&gt;
        &lt;Label x:Name="MessageLabel"
               Text="Welcome to MAUI!"/&gt;
    &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
&lt;/ContentPage&gt;</pre>
   <p>
    
     This XAML code snippet defines the basic structure of
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      ContentPage
     
    </strong>
    
     in our .NET MAUI  application.
    
    
     This page contains
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      StackLayout
     
    </strong>
    
     , which is a simple layout that arranges its
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker366">
    </a>
    
     children in a single line that can be oriented horizontally
    
    
     
      or vertically.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     After this, we implement the logic by opening
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      MainPage.xaml.cs
     
    </strong>
    
     in the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Shared
     
    </strong>
    
     project and adding the following
    
    
     
      C# code:
     
    
   </p>
   <pre class="source-code">
using Microsoft.Maui.Controls;
namespace MyMauiApp
{
    public partial class MainPage : ContentPage
    {
        public MainPage()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }
        private void OnButtonClicked(
            object sender,
            EventArgs e)
        {
            MessageLabel.Text = "You clicked the button!";
        }
    }
}</pre>
   <p>
    
     This is
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker367">
    </a>
    
     C# code-behind for the
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      MainPage
     
    </strong>
    
     class in a .NET MAUI application.
    
    
     This code complements the XAML markup you shared earlier, defining the behavior of
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      ContentPage
     
    </strong>
    
     .
    
    
     Specifically, it includes the implementation of the
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      OnButtonClicked
     
    </strong>
    
     method, which updates the text of a label named
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      MessageLabel
     
    </strong>
    
     when a button
    
    
     
      is clicked.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Finally, we can run the app.
    
    
     The
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Start
     
    </strong>
    
     button allows us to select an emulator or device as the target (see

     choose
    
    <strong class="bold">

     ; when we launch it for the first time, Visual Studio will prompt us with a wizard to
    
    
     
      install it.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Now, when we launch our app, we will see a button labeled
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Click Me
     
    </strong>
    
     (see

     When we click the button, the text below it changes to
    
    <strong class="bold">

   <p>
    
     This is
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker369">
    </a>
    
     a basic example to get us started with MAUI.
    
    
     Now that we have a running app, we can explore all the tools offered by Visual Studio to enhance our MAUI
    
    
     
      development experience.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Next, let’s explore XAML Live Preview to leverage instant
    
    
     
      UI modification.
     
    
   </p>
   <h2 id="_idParaDest-102">

   <p>
    
     The
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      XAML Live Preview
     
    </strong>
    
     feature in Visual Studio, when used with the Windows machine
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker370">
    </a>
    
     executer, allows developers to see real-time updates of their XAML UI changes without the need to manually
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker371">
    </a>
    
     save or rebuild a project.
    
    
     This feature is particularly useful for quickly iterating on UI designs and ensuring that the changes are reflected immediately in the
    
    
     
      preview window.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     To enable
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      XAML Live Preview
     
    </strong>
    
     , look for the
    
    <em class="italic">

     icon in the
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      Visual Studio toolbar
     
    </em>
    
     .
    
    
     This icon is the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      XAML Live Preview
     
    </strong>
    
     button.
    
    
     Clicking on it will enable the Live
    
    
     
      Preview feature.
     
    
   </p>
   <div><div><img alt="Figure 5.7 – The XAML Live Preview button" src="img/B22218_05_7.jpg"/>

     Figure 5.7 – The XAML Live Preview button

   <p>
    
     Note that we can open the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      XAML Live Preview
     
    </strong>
    
     directly through the Visual Studio top bar menu in
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Debug
     
    </strong>
    
     mode; navigate to

      .
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     This action allows us to dock an XAML preview window alongside Visual Studio, adjacent to our code base.
    
    
     As we modify the XAML code, the changes are reflected in the XAML Live Preview window almost instantly.
    
    
     This allows us to see the impact of our changes immediately, without the need to save or rebuild
    
    
     
      a project.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     While hovering over an element, we can retrieve a variety of style information and identify
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker372">
    </a>
    
     the file in which the
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker373">
    </a>
    
     element
    
    
     
      is defined.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In this example, we hover over the
    
    
     <strong class="source-inline">

     and

     value of the

      .
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Further, we can smoothly interact with the preview by scrolling and zooming.
    
    
     Besides scrolling with the scroll bars, we can also utilize the
    
    
     
      following interactions:

   <ul>
    <li>

       supports it)

    <li>
     
      A

     In addition, for

      A bonus of using a mouse is maintaining more
     
     
      
       precise control.
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     Additionally, we can
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker376">
    </a>
    
     add rulers to help us to define the size and position of our element.
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Rulers
     
    </strong>
    
     assist us in aligning elements within our application.
    
    
     They present distances, measured in application units.
    
    
     This feature helps us verify the spacing between different components of
    
    
     
      our application.

     The second set of toolbar buttons governs the rulers, as shown in

     Live Preview provides an selecting elements feature that mirrors the selection process in a running application.
    
    
     This functionality enables us to locate elements in either the Live Visual Tree or within the source XAML.
    
    
     Live Visual Tree is another tool that helps us understand the XAML structure of our
    
    
     
      MAUI applications.

   <p>
    
     To utilize the Live Visual Tree feature, we need to debug our application.
    
    
     By default, the

     Let’s explore these features of the Live Visual Tree with a comprehensive overview of how we can
    
    
     
      utilize them:

       the application.
      
     
     <p class="list-inset">
      
       The Live Visual Tree then automatically updates to display the corresponding node in the tree, along with its properties.
      
      
       This functionality is invaluable for swiftly identifying and inspecting specific elements within
      
      
       
        our application.

      : This mode showcases horizontal and vertical lines outlining the bounds of the selected object, along with rectangles indicating the margins.
     
     
      These visual aids make it easy to align and space UI elements, aiding in the identification of
     
     
      
       layout issues.

      It’s a convenient feature for swiftly navigating to the source code of a selected element in the Live
     
     
      
       Visual Tree.

      feature.
     
     
      This functionality hides elements that we’re probably not directly interested in, simplifying navigation through the tree.
     
     
      We can toggle this feature on and off using the

      Note that Visual Studio for Mac does not currently support
     
     
      
       this feature.

     Both the

     works by
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker384">
    </a>
    
     monitoring the source code for changes.
    
    
     When a change is detected, Hot Reload applies the changes to the running application without requiring a full rebuild.
    
    
     This means we can see the effects of our changes immediately, without losing the current state of
    
    
     
      the application.

     Now that we have explored the main tooling to enhance our experience with MAUI development, in the next section, we’ll see how we can debug our application directly

     When using Android, it’s preferable to use USB, as it’s the easiest and most
    
    
     
      reliable method.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Once connected, your device will ask you to confirm whether you trust the computer if it’s the first
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker394">
    </a>
    
     time you’ve debugged on it.
    
    
     You also have the option to select
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Always allow from this computer

     to avoid this prompt in
    
    
     
      the future.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Alternatively, it’s possible
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker395">
    </a>
    
     to debug an Android device over Wi-Fi, eliminating the need for a physical connection to the computer.
    
    
     Although this method requires more effort to set up, it can be beneficial when the device is situated far from the computer and a constant cable connection
    
    
     
      is impractical.

     In this section, we will
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker402">
    </a>
    
     see how to migrate a legacy project written with Xamarin to a cutting-edge MAUI application.
    
    
     First, we will explore the key difference between MAUI and Xamarin.
    
    
     Then, finally, we will install the .NET Upgrade Assistant to use to migrate

     Understanding the key differences
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     MAUI is considered the successor to Xamarin; however, there are some key differences
    
    
     
      between them.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Xamarin
     
    </strong>
    
     is a framework
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker403">
    </a>
    
     within the .NET ecosystem that enables developers to create cross-platform applications using C# and .NET.
    
    
     It supports major platforms such as Android, iOS, and Windows (UWP).
    
    
     Xamarin facilitates the development of native applications, ensuring high performance and native user experiences by compiling code into platform-specific
    
    
     
      native binaries.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Conversely, MAUI is the
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker404">
    </a>
    
     next iteration of Xamarin.Forms, designed to streamline cross-platform development further.
    
    
     It expands platform support to include Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows, aiming for a unified code base across these platforms.
    
    
     MAUI prioritizes modern development practices, focusing on performance optimization and delivering
    
    
     
      native-like experiences.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Xamarin.Forms provide a comprehensive set of UI controls and layouts that are rendered natively on each supported platform.
    
    
     While developers share code across platforms, Xamarin.Forms ensure that UI elements conform to the native look and feel of each platform, ensuring consistency
    
    
     
      across devices.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Further to this, MAUI introduces a fresh collection of controls and layouts designed to enhance efficiency and flexibility.
    
    
     It aims to deliver a modern, unified UI experience across all supported platforms, bridging the gap between native and cross-platform
    
    
     
      app development.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In order to migrate our legacy Xamarin project, we have two options – doing it manually or using the Upgrade Assistant.
    
    
     Let’s explore how to use the .NET
    
    
     
      Upgrade Assistant.
     
    
   </p>
   <h2 id="_idParaDest-110">
    <a id="_idTextAnchor110">
    </a>
    
     Using the .NET Upgrade Assistant
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     One of the options to migrate our project is to modify each file of a Xamarin project to MAUI by
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker405">
    </a>
    
     creating a new MAUI project.
    
    
     This way could be time-consuming and need a complete understanding of the project.
    
    
     However, it’s a great option for large and
    
    
     
      complicated projects.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Alternatively, we can
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker406">
    </a>
    
     use the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      .NET Upgrade Assistant
     
    </strong>
    
     to facilitate our process.
    
    
     The .NET Upgrade Assistant can be installed either as a Visual Studio extension or a.NET command-line tool.
    
    
     Here, in our example, we will use it as a Visual
    
    
     
      Studio extension.

   <p>
    
     The.NET Upgrade Assistant is available for installation as a Visual Studio extension or a.NET command-line tool through the
