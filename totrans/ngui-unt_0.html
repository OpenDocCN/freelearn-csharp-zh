<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to follow this book, you will need the Unity 3D software available at <a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/unity/download">http://unity3d.com/unity/download</a>.</p><p>You may use any version of Unity, but I recommend the 4.x cycle.
