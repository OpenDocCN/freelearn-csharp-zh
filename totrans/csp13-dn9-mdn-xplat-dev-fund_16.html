    <p class="normal">I wanted this book to be different from others on the market. I hope that you found it to be a brisk, fun read, packed with practical, hands-on walk-throughs of each subject.</p>
    <p class="normal">This epilogue contains the following short sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Next steps on your C# and .NET learning journey</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The tenth edition for .NET 10</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Good luck!</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-860" class="heading-1">Next steps on your C# and .NET learning journey</h1>
    <p class="normal">For subjects that I didn’t have space to include in this book but you might want to learn more about, I hope that the notes, good practice tips, and links in the GitHub repository point you in the right direction:</p>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-861" class="heading-2">Polishing your skills with design guidelines</h2>
    <p class="normal">Now that you have learned the <a id="_idIndexMarker2302"/>fundamentals of developing using C# and .NET, you are ready to improve the quality of your code by learning more detailed design guidelines.</p>
    <p class="normal">Back in the early .NET Framework era, Microsoft published a book that gave good practices in all areas of .NET development. Those recommendations are still very much applicable to modern .NET development.</p>
    <p class="normal">The following topics are covered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Naming Guidelines</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Type Design Guidelines</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Member Design Guidelines</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Designing for Extensibility</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Design Guidelines for Exceptions</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Usage Guidelines</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Common Design Patterns</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">To make the guidance as<a id="_idIndexMarker2303"/> easy to follow as possible, the recommendations are simply labeled with the terms <strong class="keyWord">Do</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Consider</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">Avoid</strong>, and <strong class="keyWord">Do not</strong>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Microsoft has made excerpts of the book available at the following link:</p>
    <p class="normal"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/</a></p>
    <p class="normal">I strongly recommend that you review all the guidelines and apply them to your code.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-862" class="heading-2">Companion books to continue your learning journey</h2>
    <p class="normal">I have written three more books<a id="_idIndexMarker2304"/> to continue the learning journey with .NET 8 and .NET 9 that you started with this fundamentals book.</p>
    <p class="normal">A summary of the .NET 8 and .NET 9 quartet of books and their most important topics is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.1</em>:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.1: Companion books for learning C# and .NET</p>
    <p class="normal">The other books act as companions to this book, and together, they all form a .NET 8 <a id="_idIndexMarker2305"/>and .NET 9 quartet of books:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">The first book (the one you’re reading now) covers the fundamentals of C#, .NET, and ASP.NET Core for modern web development. The ninth edition for .NET 9 is a small update from the 8<sup class="superscript">th</sup> edition because .NET 9 is a Standard Term Support release (only 18 months). It includes the errata and improvements listed since the publishing of the 8<sup class="superscript">th</sup> edition, which can be found at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/errata/README.md">https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/errata/README.md</a>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">The second book covers real-world web development with .NET 9. This means it covers technologies that are mature and proven and are based on controller architecture. This includes ASP.NET Core MVC, Web API using controllers, OData, and the most popular .NET CMS, Umbraco.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">The third book covers important tools and skills you should learn to become a well-rounded professional .NET developer. These include design patterns and solution architecture, debugging, memory analysis, all the important types of testing from unit and integration to performance and web UI testing, and then topics like Docker and .NET Aspire. Finally, it looks at how to prepare for an interview to get the .NET developer career that you want. This book will not be updated for .NET 9.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">The fourth book covers more specialized topics, like internationalization and popular third-party packages including Serilog and Noda Time. It shows you how to build native AOT-compiled services with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs and how to improve performance, scalability, and reliability using caching, queues, and background services. It covers implementing more services using GraphQL, gRPC, SignalR, and Azure Functions. Finally, it shows you how to build graphical user interfaces for websites and desktop and mobile apps with Blazor <a id="_idIndexMarker2306"/>and .NET MAUI. This book will not be updated for .NET 9.</li>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-864" class="heading-1">The tenth edition for .NET 10</h1>
    <p class="normal">I have already started work identifying areas for improvement for the tenth edition, which we plan to publish alongside updates to the other members of my quartet of .NET books. I expect .NET 10 to make worthwhile improvements to all aspects of .NET and as a <strong class="keyWord">Long Term Support</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">LTS</strong>) release, it will be supported until November 2028.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can learn <a id="_idIndexMarker2308"/>how to use .NET 10 with this book, including .NET 10 previews, starting in February 2025, at the following link:</p>
