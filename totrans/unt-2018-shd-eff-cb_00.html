<p class="calibre3"><em class="calibre14">Unity 2018 Shaders and Effects Cookbook</em> is your guide to becoming familiar with the creation of shaders and post-processing effects in Unity 2018. You will start your journey at the beginning, exploring the Post Processing Stack to see some of the possible ways you can use shaders to affect what you see without having to write scripts at all. Afterwards, we learn how to create shaders from scratch, starting by creating the most basic shaders and learning how the shader code is structured. This foundational knowledge will arm you with the means to progress further through each chapter, learning advanced techniques such as volumetric explosions and fur shading. We also explore the newly added Shader Graph editor to see how you can create shaders through a drag and drop interface as well! This edition of the book is written specifically for Unity 2018 and will help you to master physically-based rendering and global illumination to get as close to photorealism as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre3">By the end of each chapter, you will have gained new skills that will increase the quality of your shaders and even make your shader writing process more efficient. These chapters have been tailored so that you can jump into each section and learn a specific skill from beginner to expert. For those who are new to shader writing in Unity, you can progress through each chapter, one at a time, to build on your knowledge. Either way, you will learn the techniques that make modern games look the way they do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once you have completed this book, you will have a set of shaders that you can use in your Unity 3D games as well as the understanding to add to them, accomplish new effects, and address performance needs. So, let's get started!</p>
