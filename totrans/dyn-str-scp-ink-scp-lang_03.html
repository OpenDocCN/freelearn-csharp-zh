			<p>This chapter introduces the concept of knots, sections of an ink story, and diverts, which is the functionality to move between them. We will then move into defining and moving between knots to create simple looping patterns. By incorporating choices (covered in <a href="B17597_01_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Text, Flow, Choices, and Weaves</em>), we will see how you can begin to experience narratives composed of selecting options, having the story move between knots, and then use looping patterns to build complex interactions from simple rules in ink.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tangling a flow in knots</li>
				<li>Moving between sections</li>
				<li>Looping knots</li>
				<li>Detecting and changing options</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>The examples used in this chapter, in <code>*.ink</code> files, can be found online on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Dynamic-Story-Scripting-with-the-ink-Scripting-Language/tree/main/Chapter2">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Dynamic-Story-Scripting-with-the-ink-Scripting-Language/tree/main/Chapter2</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Tangling a flow in knots</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B17597_01_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Text, Flow, Choices, and Weaves</em>, choices were explained as capable of branching a story<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> into different sections. Some simple branching structures were shown, but movement through a story consisted of flowing down from one weave to another. When a section is given a name in ink, it becomes one of its central concepts: a <code>==</code>) and the name of the knot on a single line. After this definition, every line until the next knot encountered becomes a part of the original knot. By giving names to sections, they can be navigated to within ink to create more complex narrative experiences for readers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Creating knots</h2>
			<p>A physical book is often divided<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> into chapters. With knots, a digital ink story can also be divided into different parts. While a novel or textbook might use names for sections based on the word <em class="italic">chapter</em>, digital stories can grow beyond these limitations to use locations, characters, or other, more abstract divisions of a story.</p>
			<p>For example, an ink story based on a detective speaking to different suspects of a crime might divide itself up into knots based on its characters, as illustrated in the following code snippet:</p>
			<pre>The detective considered the suspects in front of her.
 
== lady_taylor
 
== lord_davies
 
== sir_jones
 
== lady_turner</pre>
			<p>The name of knots in ink must follow three specific rules, as outlined here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>They can contain numbers.</li>
				<li>They can contain uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>
				<li>The only special symbol allowed is an underscore.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Spaces cannot be used in the names of knots. Without spaces to break up words, knot names are often written<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> using lowercase letters with an underscore between names, words, or other important details.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Diverting between knots</h2>
			<p>Creating knots themselves<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> has little usefulness without a way to move between them. In ink, moving between knots is called <code>-</code>) and a greater-than sign (<code>&gt;</code>). This combination, <code>-&gt;</code>, points to which knot<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> the flow will move to next, as illustrated in the following code snippet:</p>
			<pre>-&gt; example_knot
 
== example_knot
Some content.</pre>
			<p>Once defined, a knot can be accessed by any other code within the same story. Within an ink story using knots, it is not uncommon for one of the first lines of code to be a divert.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Using DONE and END</h2>
			<p>The introduction to the concept of a <em class="italic">flow</em> in <a href="B17597_01_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Text, Flow, Choices, and Weaves</em> mentioned a specific error<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> that all the three previous code examples in this chapter<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> have in common. Because diverting between knots introduces the possibility of creating a complex narrative, ink needs to know at least one ending of the story to stop a story from <em class="italic">running out</em>. To help signal to ink when a story is going to end, all stories have two built-in knots called <code>DONE</code> and <code>END</code>. Unlike other knots using lowercase and— often—underscores, these are written using uppercase letters.</p>
			<p>The differences between <code>DONE</code> and <code>END</code> are in their usage. When a story diverts to <code>DONE</code> (<code>-&gt; DONE</code>), it signals the end of the current flow but not the end of the story. <code>END</code>, however, signals the end of all possible flows and completely ends a story. The use of <code>DONE</code> allows for creating a new flow structure. <code>END</code> stops the story and does not allow for anything else to happen.</p>
			<p>Any ink story diverting<a id="_idIndexMarker047"/> to a knot, not <code>DONE</code> or <code>END</code>, must divert to either at some point, or the story<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> will be unusable. Returning to the use of <code>example_knot</code> earlier in this chapter, a usable form of the code would be this:</p>
			<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Example 1</p>
			<pre>-&gt; example_knot
== example_knot
Some content.
-&gt; DONE</pre>
			<p>Within Inky, the use of the phrase <code>End of story</code> displayed at the end of every output is the use of the special knot, <code>END</code>. Without content to show, the story has come to its end. In the terminology of ink, it has diverted to <code>END</code>. Here is a screenshot displaying this:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.1_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – End of story&#13;&#10;" width="496" height="152"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – End of story</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Moving between sections</h1>
			<p>Knots allow authors<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> to divide up an ink story into sections they can name. Diverting allows for moving between these knots. In <a href="B17597_01_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Text, Flow, Choices, and Weaves</em>, choices were introduced using the asterisk (<code>*</code>) and the ability to branch a story. Using a divert as the result of a choice allows an author to craft a weave, a set of choices, where each could divert to different knots.</p>
			<p>For example, returning to the detective<a id="_idIndexMarker050"/> example earlier in the chapter, an updated version with choices where each one diverted to knots for the characters would look like this:</p>
			<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Example 2</p>
			<pre>The detective considered the suspects in front of her.
* Lady Taylor
    -&gt; lady_taylor
* Lord Davies
    -&gt; lord_davies
* Sir Jones
    -&gt; sir_jones
* Lady Turner
    -&gt; lady_turner
 
== lady_taylor
Standing off to the side of the gathered crowd and looking out the window was Lady Taylor. She was elegantly dressed in a cream evening gown and the light from the storm outside was a stark contrast to the flowing dress and quiet form of the woman.
The detective made her way over to question her.
-&gt; DONE
== lord_davies
"Ah! Detective!" barked the commanding voice of Lord Davies. With a drink in his hand and the red evidence of practiced drinking on his face, he began again. "Over here! I know you will want to hear what happened from me."
The detective considered the man and then turned to face him.
-&gt; DONE
== sir_jones
The detective turned to the fireplace. Leaning against it was "Sir Jones." The detective knew this was a nickname for the person in front of her. They were neither of the rank "sir" in this area nor was their name "Jones." They had appeared about six months ago at parties like this one and was quite a fixture at this point. No one knew much about them other than that they went by the name "Sir Jones" now.
The detective regarded them for a moment and headed over.
-&gt; DONE 
== lady_turner
Lady Turner had been crying. The evidence of sorrow was etched into the drying black edges of her makeup at the bottom of her eyes as she tried to clean up her face. As the detective looked over, Lady Turner caught her eye and seemed to communicate how much she did not like to show the evidence of crying on her face and was trying to clear it quickly.
The detective walked to her and sat down.
-&gt; DONE</pre>
			<p>In the updated version, a <em class="italic">weave</em> is added. Each choice within it immediately diverts to a knot matching a character. Inside the knots<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> is a use of the built-in <code>DONE</code> knot to let ink know the flow should stop after the content of the knot. In the new code, a much more complex story is created by only using the three concepts of choices, diverts, and knots.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Knots and stitches</h2>
			<p>Knots<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> allow an ink story to be broken up into different parts. Within a knot, additional subsections<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> can be added, called <code>=</code>) and its name. Stitches<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> follow the same naming rules of knots: they can contain numbers, letters, and an underscore, but cannot use any other special characters. Stitches can also only appear inside an existing knot.</p>
			<p>Returning to the <code>example_knot</code> code, two stitches could be added, as follows:</p>
			<pre>-&gt; example_knot
== example_knot
= stitch_one
= stitch_two</pre>
			<p>The common error of a flow <em class="italic">running out</em> for knots also applies to stitches. As subsections of a story, they must also either divert to another knot or stitch or use the built-in knots to stop the flow or story. In the following screenshot, you can see an example of a flow running out in a stitch:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.2_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – An error of flow running out in an example stitch&#13;&#10;" width="571" height="214"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – An error of flow running out in an example stitch</p>
			<p>The first stitch in a knot<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> is an exception to this error. The story will flow from the knot<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> into the first stitch automatically. A corrected<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> version of the previous example, accounting for flowing<a id="_idIndexMarker059"/> into the first stitch and including additional diverts, is given here:</p>
			<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Example 3</p>
			<pre>-&gt; example_knot
== example_knot
= stitch_one
Diverting to example_knot will automatically show this.
-&gt; DONE
= stitch_two
-&gt; DONE</pre>
			<p>This would be the output:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.3_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – Inky output from diverting to example_knot&#10;" width="573" height="98"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – Inky output from diverting to example_knot </p>
			<p>As their own subsections<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> of an ink story, stitches can also be accessed<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> directly. Diverting<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> to a stitch inside<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> of a knot follows <code>.</code>), is used between the name of the divert<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> and the stitch within it.</p>
			<p>Diverting directly to <code>stitch_two</code> at the top of the previous code would produce the following code:</p>
			<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Example 4</p>
			<pre>-&gt; example_knot.stitch_two
== example_knot
= stitch_one
Diverting to example_knot will automatically show this.
-&gt; DONE
= stitch_two
This will now appear because the stitch is being diverted to directly.
-&gt; DONE</pre>
			<p>This would be the output:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.4_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – Ink output from diverting to example_knot.stitch_two stitch&#13;&#10;" width="687" height="97"/>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Dividing up a story across different files</h2>
			<p>As new knots and stitches<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> are added to a single file, they can quickly grow very long. To help with this issue, ink has a keyword for combining files: <code>INCLUDE</code>. When used with ink code, the <code>INCLUDE</code> keyword includes another file based on its filename.</p>
			<p>The use of the <code>INCLUDE</code> keyword has the following two rules:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It should only be used at the top of files.</li>
				<li>It cannot be used inside knots.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In Inky, additional files can be added to an existing project by using the <strong class="bold">New Included ink File</strong> menu option, as illustrated in the following screenshot, and naming the new file:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.5_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – Inky's New Included Ink File menu option&#13;&#10;" width="221" height="194"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – Inky's New Included Ink File menu option</p>
			<p>Using this functionality with the main ink file option also adds a single newline to the existing ink file, if it exists. For example, creating an <code>additionalFile.ink</code> file will generate an additional line of code: <code>INCLUDE additionalFile.ink</code>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Warning</p>
			<p class="callout">Inky does not automatically add <code>.ink</code> to a filename when creating included ink files. It is strongly recommended to always add the file type when using this functionality.</p>
			<p>Every use of <code>INCLUDE</code> adds the file to the current project. This means any knots and stitches in these included files<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> can be accessed by any others. Because files can be named after locations, characters, or other abstractions in the story, this allows an author to break a story into different files with their own knots and stitches, as shown in the following code example:</p>
			<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Example 5</p>
			<pre>INCLUDE books.ink
You stand in front of a shelf with two books.
* [Red Book]
    -&gt; books.red_book
* [Blue Book]
    -&gt; books.blue_book</pre>
			<p>Each choice diverts to a stitch in another file in the new example. Because Inky uses <code>INCLUDE</code> to combine files into a single project, the knots and stitches as part of the <code>books.ink</code> file can be accessed as if all the code were part of one file, as illustrated in the following code example:</p>
			<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Example 5 (books.ink)</p>
			<pre>== books
= red_book
The red book slides open as a deep, masculine voice fills your mind.
-&gt; DONE
= blue_book
The blue book slowly flips open as a reluctant, feminine voice creeps into your thoughts.
-&gt; DONE</pre>
			<p>Flow runs top to bottom in ink. Starting with the first file, the flow would show the weave of two choices. Choosing the <code>Red Book</code> option would then divert to the stitch in the other file and, ultimately, to the use of the divert<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> in the <code>DONE</code> special knot, as illustrated in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.6_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – Combined output from Red Book choice in Example 5&#13;&#10;" width="713" height="180"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – Combined output from Red Book choice in Example 5</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Looping knots</h1>
			<p>A knot can <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>divert to itself. This fundamental concept is an important part of the advanced dialog and narrative structures in ink. However, care must be taken when having knots divert to themselves or in a looping pattern. It can become very easy to create <strong class="bold">infinite loops</strong> where the code loops<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> without stopping. To prevent this error, it is always a good idea to include a weave with at least one choice whose content ends the story or breaks the loop.</p>
			<p>By combining choices, diverts, and knots, looping structures can be created. Within these structures, sticky choices become important for creating consistent options for readers to choose from during each loop.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Looping structures</h2>
			<p>The most <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>basic looping structure has two choices. The first continues the loop and the second must end the story somehow, as illustrated in the following code example:</p>
			<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Example 6</p>
			<pre>You look at the rock in front of you.
-&gt; rock
== rock
* Push the rock up the hill.
    -&gt; rock
* Ignore the rock for now.
    -&gt; DONE</pre>
			<p>Choices, those created with an asterisk (<code>*</code>), can only be used once in an entire story. In the previous example, if the first option is chosen, the loop repeats, but the second option then appears as the only one, as illustrated in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.7_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – Example 6 choices after one loop&#13;&#10;" width="525" height="194"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – Example 6 choices after one loop</p>
			<p>In some stories, reducing the options as the reader moves through the story could work well, but a different type of choice is needed for those cases where the same options are needed for every loop: <strong class="bold">sticky choices</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Revisiting sticky choices</h2>
			<p>In <a href="B17597_01_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Text, Flow, Choices, and Weaves</em>, sticky choices were introduced. Shown as part of<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> a flow moving<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> from top to bottom and without repeating any sections, sticky choices did not seem very useful at the time. However, within looping patterns using diverts and knots, sticky choices are often the best type of choice to use, as illustrated in the following code example:</p>
			<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Example 7</p>
			<pre>You look at the rock in front of you.
-&gt; rock
== rock
+ Push the rock up the hill.
    -&gt; rock
+ Ignore the rock for now.
    -&gt; rock</pre>
			<p>In the updated code, both options are sticky choices. This new code allows for a repeating pattern and consistent weave options regardless of loop count, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.8_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – Inky output from multiple loops of Example 7" width="534" height="328"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – Inky output from multiple loops of Example 7</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Detecting and changing options</h1>
			<p>Knots and stitches are not the only ink concept<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> capable of looping—options can<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> do so as well. They also have the unique ability to detect<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> when they are part of looping structures. These special types of options are named <strong class="bold">labeled options</strong>. They create an ability<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> to give a <em class="italic">label</em> to an option and track if it has been seen before in the story. Labels<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> are also an example of a <strong class="bold">variable</strong>: a value changed as part of the story by code.</p>
			<p>The use of labeled options enables us to use the second type of option: <code>true</code>, the option is shown. If it is not, the option is hidden.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Labeled and conditional options</h2>
			<p>Labeled options<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> are created using open and closing parentheses around a name after the symbol<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> for a choice, a plus sign (<code>+</code>) or asterisk (<code>*</code>), and the text of the choice itself. Labeled options follow the same rules as the name of knots and stitches: they can contain numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and an underscore. They cannot contain spaces or other special symbols. This is illustrated in the following code snippet:</p>
			<pre>You look at the rock in front of you.
-&gt; rock
== rock
+ (push) Push the rock up the hill.
    -&gt; rock
* Push the rock over the edge.
    -&gt; DONE</pre>
			<p>In the new example code, a label called <code>push</code> is added to the first option and exists as a variable in the story. Because it is part of the option itself, its value will be increased every time the option is revisited<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> in the story. This allows an author to test whether the player has been picking<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> the same option multiple times. The following code example illustrates this:</p>
			<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Example 8</p>
			<pre>You look at the rock in front of you.
-&gt; rock
== rock
+ (push) Push the rock up the hill.
    -&gt; rock
* {push &gt;= 4} Push the rock over the edge.
    -&gt; DONE</pre>
			<p>In the latest change, a conditional option has also been added using open—<code>{</code>—and closing—<code>}</code>—curly brackets around the comparison between a variable and a value. In the new code, when the story starts, the reader can choose the <code>Push the rock up the hill</code> option. As they do, the value of the label for the option also increases. Once its value is at least <code>4</code>, the second option becomes available, and the reader can push the rock over the edge, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.9_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Push the rock up the hill chosen four times in Example 8" width="587" height="454"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – Push the rock up the hill chosen four times in Example 8</p>
			<p>Conditional and labeled options can also be combined. However, the order in which they appear is important. Labels<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/> must appear in front of conditional options. They cannot appear<a id="_idIndexMarker083"/> in the other order, as illustrated in the following code example:</p>
			<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Example 9</p>
			<pre>You look at the rock in front of you.
-&gt; rock
== rock
+ (push) {push &lt; 6} Push the rock up the hill.
    -&gt; rock
* {push &gt;= 6} Push the rock over the edge.
    -&gt; DONE</pre>
			<p>In the new example code, the reader only sees a single option when the story starts. They must make the same choice six times before the first option is removed and the second becomes available. Once the reader selects this option, the story finally ends.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Building dynamic weaves</h2>
			<p>Sticky choices enable options<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> to remain across loops created by diverting to the same knot. Labeled and conditional options allow for tracking and showing certain options after certain conditions are met in a story. Using all these concepts, dynamic weaves become possible, as illustrated in the following code example:</p>
			<p class="SC---Link" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Example 10</p>
			<pre>You pause to double-check check the folder again. Yes, you have all the evidence here.
You nod at your partner and he enters the other room. You take a breath and open the door.
The suspect sits in front of you. As you take a seat, she turns to look at you.
-&gt; interrogation
== interrogation
+ (knife) {knife &lt; 1} [Ask about the knife]
    The suspect shakes their head. "I don't know nothing!"
    -&gt; interrogation
+ (knife_again) {knife == 1 &amp;&amp; knife_again &lt; 1} [Ask about the     knife again.]
    You take a picture of the knife out of the folder and put       it down on the table without saying another word.
    -&gt; interrogation
+ (knife_once_again) {knife_again == 1 &amp;&amp; knife_once_again &lt; 1} [Ask about the knife one more time.]
    "Yes. Fine. It's mine," the suspect replies and crosses       her arms. Looking at them, you notice the slight cuts on        the underside of her arm.
    -&gt; interrogation
+ (cuts) {knife_once_again == 1 &amp;&amp; cuts &lt; 1} [Ask about the   cuts on her arm.]
    You point to the cuts on her arms. 
    She shrugs. "It was an accident."
    You frown and point at the knife.
    "It's my knife, yes," she says, looking away.
    -&gt; interrogation
+ {cuts == 1} [Take out the picture of the gun next.]
    "This is not yours, though," you say, taking out the       picture.
    She does not look back.
    "He attacked you. And not for the first time," you say       and point to the older scars still visible. "You finally         had enough. You shot him."
    She still looks away, but you can see her shoulders slump.       She knows that you know. 
    -&gt; DONE</pre>
			<p>In the new code, complex combinations<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> of labels and conditional options are used to track information during the interrogation of the suspect. Making one choice unlocks the next in order, as the flow loops back to the same knot as information is slowly unlocked and the reader learns more through making one choice at a time.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Some conditional<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> options in <em class="italic">Example 10</em> use two ampersands, <code>&amp;&amp;</code>. This is known as <code>true</code>, it checks the next. If both are true, the entire combination is true.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, easier ways to create sequences of information will be covered, as well as introducing randomness into creating text and options. Instead of using diverts and knots, ink <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>supplies much simpler functionality for doing the same general actions and building repetitions explicitly using knots each time.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter introduced you to knots, sections of a story, and diverts, which are ways to move between them. We examined the use of <code>DONE</code> and <code>END</code> as built-in knots to end a flow (<code>DONE</code>) and stop a story completely (<code>END</code>). Stitches, subsections of a knot, were then discussed to break up a story into even more parts. We learned that the <code>INCLUDE</code> keyword can be used to break a story into separate files and be <em class="italic">included</em> as part of the same project.</p>
			<p>Knots can divert to themselves. This, as we saw, is the key to creating looping structures where the use of other concepts, labeled and conditional options, can also be combined. Labels allow us to create variables for tracking how many times an option has been shown. Labeled options then led on to using conditional options, testing how many times an option has been chosen when using a looping structure. Finally, we ended with making a dynamic weave, using a looping structure where each choice made changed the values of labels and unlocked each choice in order.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will build on the concepts of knots and diverts. By navigating to different sections of a story, alternatives, an ink concept where different text is shown across a story or because of multiple loops, becomes possible. This allows ink to react to readers revisiting knots and options to show different content.</p>
