    of the look and feel of the controls across the application. For example, if you
    are using buttons, they should look the same—similar colors, the same margins,
    and so on.

- en: In the Win32/WinForms model, the look and the behavior of the controls were
    tightly bundled; but in WPF world a control template is created in XAML using
    designer-oriented tools, and this applies styles to produce a similar look. You
    can also inherit a style from a different style.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you create a `Style` object, you set a bunch of `Setter` objects to it
    to define various properties to change the look and feel of the control. This
    may include the height, width, positions, alignments, colors, fonts, control template,
    triggers, and more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `FrameworkElement` class exposes a `Style` property that can be filled by
    a `Style` object. Styles are always built as resources, as you see them inside
    the `<Window.Resources>` tag in our example. It contains an `x:Key` property,
    which defines the name/key of the style. By using this `Key`, you can perform
    a binding from any other resources/controls within the scope. The `TargetType`
    property of a `Style` object is typically set, which makes the `Style` applicable
    to that type, which can be any type, even a type of a custom control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the same to some other element type will cause a runtime exception.

    `Style` can be written as shown here to get the same result:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE5]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: As this makes the property name redundant, to define a qualified name people
    prefer to use the first one with a `TargetType` defined. Then, what is the use
    of the second type of declaration? Yes, the question is valid. With this type
    of styling, by specifying the fully qualified name of the property, you can define
    a style targeting various types of controls where the said properties are available.

- en: In the previous two recipes, we learned about creating styles and applying them
    to controls by using the `x:Key` name. It's not always feasible to manually assign
    the style to a set of huge controls within the same application. For this reason,
    we need to apply it automatically to all the elements within the scope of a specific
    window or the entire application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, we may want all buttons within the same app to have the same look
    and feel. This makes creating new buttons easier, as the developer/designer doesn't
    have to know what style to apply. If the auto styling is configured, it will make
    the work far smoother.

    in XAML with a `<Trigger>` element. It triggers when a specific property on the
    owner control changes to match a specified value.

    the `IsMouseOver="True"` property value. When the condition satisfies, it sets
    the `Setter` properties as defined under it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the properties to their original values. This means that it is not required to

    hosts a collection of these `Condition` objects.

    values to its original state.

- en: The event triggers are generally used to perform actions when the **Routed Events**
    of the associated `FrameworkElement` raises. This is mainly used in animations
    to control the look and feel when a certain UI event is raised.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this example, when you hover over the mouse cursor on the `TextBlock` control,
    the `MouseEnter` event fires and that triggers `EventTrigger`, which we have defined
    in the XAML. It then animates the text to have a bigger font size and a higher
    opacity to give a bigger, better visible content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the `MouseLeave` event fires, it reduces the size of the font and brings
    the control opacity to `20%`. More about the `Storyboard` animations will be discussed
    in *Chapter 8,* *Working with Animations*.
