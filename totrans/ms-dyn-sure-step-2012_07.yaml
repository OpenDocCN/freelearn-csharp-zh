    services delivery team should meet with the customer to ascertain and confirm
    that they are interested in performing the upgrade. Especially where delivery
    resources are in high demand, this is an important step that sales teams need
    to carry out before involving delivery resources such as solution architects and
    senior application consultants. Sales personnel can use resources from the Sure
    Step Diagnostic Preparation activity to understand and position the current capabilities
    of the corresponding Microsoft Dynamics solution.

    an existing Microsoft Dynamics customer. The Upgrade Assessment Service is executed
    by the services delivery team to get an understanding of the existing solution
    being used by the customer, determine the components that need to be upgraded
    to the current release of the product, and determine whether any other features
    need to be enabled as part of the upgrade engagement.

    so on; therefore, they can also be leveraged through the following steps:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Dynamics and any associated ISV software to determine whether the upgrade from
    the customer's existing product version to the targeted version of Microsoft Dynamics
    is supported. This will have a bearing on how the upgrade can be executed—can
    you follow a supported upgrade path, or is it pretty much a complete reimplementation
    of the solution?
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    solution's configurations and customizations. In this step, the delivery team
    reviews which features of Microsoft Dynamics have been enabled for the customer,
    including which ones have been configured to meet the customer's needs and which
    ones have been customized. This will allow the delivery team to consider the overall
    objectives for the upgrade and determine which of these configurations and customizations
    will need to be ported over to the new solution and which ones should be retired.
    For example, the older version may have necessitated customizations in areas where
    the solution did not have a corresponding functionality. Or perhaps the solution
    needed a specific ISV solution to meet a need. If the current product version
    provides these features as standard functionalities, these customizations or ISV
    solutions would no longer need to be part of the new solution. Data migration
    (if required) from previous versions to the new one must be considered as part
    of this step.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the existing solution. This includes assessing any custom code written to interface
    the solution with third-party solutions, such as an external database for reporting
    purposes. This step is followed by reviewing the existing infrastructure and architecture
    configuration so that the delivery team can understand the hardware components
    that can be leveraged for the new solution. The delivery team can provide confirmation
    on whether the existing infrastructure can support the upgrade application, or
    whether additional infrastructure components may be necessary.

    business functions and requirements that need to be upgraded to the new release.
    Using Fit Gap and Solution Blueprint Service, they can then determine and document
    how these requirements will be ported over. If meeting the requirement is more
    than just implementing standard features, the approach maybe a re-configuration,
    custom code rewrite, or workflow setup. Additionally, if new features are required
    as part of the upgrade, these requirements should also be classified in the Fit
    Gap worksheet either as a Fit or as a Gap. They should also be further classified
    as Standard, Configuration, or Workflow as the case may be for Fits and Customization
    for Gaps.

    and resources needed to execute the upgrade. If it was determined with the Upgrade

    and the customer must also determine the Release plan. We will discuss upgrade
    approaches and Release planning in more detail in the following section.

    hosted or self-hosted models, it is important to understand the potential impacts
    of moving to the cloud for all or part of the implementation. The Fit Gap and
    Solution Blueprint and the Architecture Assessment should be reflected accordingly.
    An example of this is the new Dynamics GP 2013 web client. This can be hosted
    by a partner with Azure or it can be self-hosted. Recent examples show that many
    businesses are opting to self-host with local financial users choosing the classic
    client whereas supply chain or remote users are utilizing the web interface.

    Accelerator Services—the Fit Gap and Solution Blueprint, the Architecture Assessment,
    and the Scoping Assessment—can be executed together with the Upgrade Assessment
    Service as one engagement for the customer if required. The point of this section
    is not that each of these offerings needs to be positioned individually for the
    customer. On the contrary, depending on the scope, the delivery team could easily
    perform the exercise in tandem. The point of emphasis in this section for the
    reader is that if you are assessing an upgrade for the customer, you should be
    able to leverage the templates in each service and combine them as you deem fit
    for your engagement.

    offering may also apply to an upgrade engagement but typically only for a small
    subset of customers. Examples include customers who may be using a very old version
    of the Microsoft Dynamics solution, which means that they pretty much need a reimplementation
    of the solution with the new version of the product, or customers who need a complex
    functionality to be enabled as part of the upgrade. In both these cases, the customer
    may request the delivery team to conduct Proof of Concept Services of the solution
    prior to embarking on a full upgrade, in which case the Proof of Concept service
    may be executed. They may also request assistance from the delivery team to assess
    the return on investment for the upgraded solution, in which case the Business
    Case may be employed.

    or more delivery Releases. If for example, the customer's solution is on a supported
    upgrade path, the **Technical Upgrade** may be delivered in a single Release using
    the Sure Step Upgrade Project Type. If the new solution requires several new processes
    to be enabled, the **Functional Upgrade** may be delivered in two or more Releases.
    For example, if the customer needs an advanced supply chain functionality such
    as production scheduling and/or advanced warehousing to be enabled as part of
    the upgrade, a two-step upgrade is the recommended approach. First complete the
    **Technical Upgrade** using the Sure Step Upgrade Project Type to port the existing
    functionality over to the new product version in **Release 1**. On completion,
    add the advanced supply chain functionality using the **Rapid**, **Standard**,
    **Agile**, or **Enterprise** project types in **Release 2**.

    depending on customer engagement. Regardless of how they are executed, it is imperative
    that the customer and delivery team select the right approach and develop the
    necessary plans such as Project Plan, Resource Plan, Project Charter, and/or Communication
    Plan. These documents should form the basis for the upgrade delivery proposal.
    When the Proposal and **Statement of Work (SOW)** are approved, it is time to

    FRD should clearly note the existing business functions and requirements that
    will be upgraded to the new release and also any additional requirements (in other
    words, a new functionality) to be delivered as part of the upgrade. The Fit Gap
    Finalization builds on the requirements using the Fit Gap worksheet to determine
    how these requirements will be delivered—by implementing standard features, configuration
    or reconfiguration, the workflow setup, or new/rewritten custom code.

    activity constitutes the start of Data Migration activities, beginning with the
    identification of existing data sources, including the existing Microsoft Dynamics
    solution, any ISV solutions, and any interface programs. Also in scope is the
    identification of additional data sources and how they will be accessed. Additional
    items for consideration include the state of the source data (amount of data cleansing
    required, who, how, where, when the data will be cleansed, and so on), any legal
    requirements for data retention, and strategies for warehousing of data external
    to the Microsoft Dynamics solution. Depending on the state of the source date,
    the team may also need to identify whether **Extract Transform and Load** (**ETL**)
    tools may be needed for data cleansing and migration efforts. It should also be
    determined which parts of data migration will be automated and which, if any,
    require manual execution.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the goal of the Analysis phase is to understand the requirements to establish
    the overall scope for the upgrade engagement, the Design phase is used to define
    how the technical upgrade will be implemented. Objectives include planning the
    steps for executing the upgrade and identifying conflicts for upgrading the custom
    code. It also includes proactively planning for potential post-upgrade issues
    and reviewing the existing integration and interfaces between Microsoft Dynamics
    and third-party solutions to determine whether they need to be upgraded to work
    with the newer version of the Microsoft Dynamics solution. Accordingly, the key
    Design phase activities include **Data Upgrade Checklist** for planning and executing
    the upgrade, **Existing Code Review** to analyze and identify any conflicts created
    by customizations to the existing solution, and **Existing Integrations and Interfaces
    Review** to determine which existing integrations and interfaces need to be upgraded.
    If product tools are available to support these activities, links to the corresponding
    tools are referenced in Sure Step. For example, Microsoft Dynamics AX provides
    an upgrade checklist utility with the required and optional steps denoted in a
    sequential manner to provide guidance and assistance during the upgrade process
    as well as a Compare tool for Microsoft Dynamics AX to help determine and resolve
    code conflicts for solution customizations. Microsoft Dynamics AX has a unique
    architecture where the code can be saved in different layers, (such as a USR layer
    for customer users and a VAR layer for partners). The Compare tool also provides
    the ability to compare and detect code conflicts while upgrading one layer at
    a time or simultaneously in all layers.

    **User Training** is a key activity in this phase wherein end users get hands-on
    training on the new system before they go live. Depending on the size of the organization,
    training could be executed in groups—typically, the delivery team will train key
    users or a core set of users who will then act as trainers for the remaining end
    users. Technical training pertaining to updated technology must also be incorporated
    at this time; examples include updates to SQL Management or Reporting Services
    which are often overlooked as "nice to have". This is important to ensure the
    customer takes full advantage of the new technical improvements available.

    product- and industry-focused UAT script templates that the delivery teams should
    leverage. These detailed scripts walk the user through the steps for executing
    a given process or functionality. In many instances, delivery teams have also
    leveraged the details in these scripts to develop Training guides for the previous

- en: The manufacturer was headquartered in the US and had multiple manufacturing
    and distribution agencies around the world. The organization's HQ was running
    an older version of Microsoft Dynamics AX, Axapta 3.0, while other manufacturing
    entities from the acquisition were running different legacy ERP systems. The company
    decided to not only consolidate its systems to benefit from economies of scale
    from its IT operations but also enable consistent processes throughout the subsidiaries
    of the organization.

- en: The company worked with a Gold-Certified Microsoft Partner and went through
    a thorough Upgrade Assessment and Solution Envisioning processes. From the discovery
    of these processes, the company realized that it was running a heavily customized
    version of Axapta at its HQ, which would not only make for a complex upgrade process
    but was also not a sustainable solution to standardize across multiple entities.
    At that point, the company decided to alter its overall solution and IT strategy.
    They began by reviewing the standard functionality in the newest Microsoft Dynamics
    AX release, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, and then considered replacing modifications
    with the standard functionality wherever feasible, even if it meant changing some
    of their business processes. The diagnostic exercise, executed jointly by the
    partner consultants, and the customer's process and technical experts, led to
    the determination that they could replace about 40 percent of the customized functionality
    with the standard functionality in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009.

    core objective of minimizing customizations for business processes that were unique
    to each operation. Because some of the company's business processes were inherently
    unique, such as dealing with government regulations for a specific product, the
    organization realized that while they could share best practices for a common
    solution; they also needed to account for the unique site requirements. Accordingly,
    the joint customer and partner team decided to leverage both the Upgrade and Implementation
    project types of the Sure Step methodology for the development and the rollout
    of the solution across sites.

- en: The team combines guidance and artifacts from the Sure Step Upgrade project
    type with the Enterprise project type to develop an approach for the rollout of
    a consistent solution between the headquarters and its subsidiaries. The team
    began with a planning session that included a group of cross-functional and cross-organization
    analysts from business and IT functions. They designed a core solution that accounted
    for the common requirements across the organization, which formed the basis for
    the **Core Build**. The Core Build leveraged standard functionalities to the maximum
    extent and included minor custom code modifications where necessary. The team
    also developed Site Builds for the HQ and Subs, which accounted for specific requirements
    at that site. The corresponding builds were then merged for the HQ and Sub Site
    Rollouts.

    Vice President of Operations credited the Sure Step methodology for helping to
    keep the project on track. He quoted, "By using the Sure Step methodology, we
    were confident in moving from one task to the next. Once everyone left the kickoff
    meeting, they needed to know exactly what to take care of. The methodology helped
    us to articulate exactly how we would accomplish each task." The company's IT
    Director also agreed by saying, "This was not the first time that we've gone through
    an ERP implementation. But, it was certainly the best implementation that we've
    ever done, in terms of how smoothly the Go-Live went."

    users, affording them important timesaving capabilities. The customer saw greater
    employee productivity as well as gains in shortened quote-to-sales order cycle.
    They were also able to establish proper reorder points, which gave them better
    visibility, and in turn improved inventory turns. The company's process experts
    were also enthusiastic about the reduced complexity and less burdensome processes
    in areas such as managing the company's pricing structure.

    licensing, infrastructure, and ongoing maintenance aspects. By migrating all of
    its business groups onto Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, the organization eliminated
    its software-licensing costs for other legacy ERP systems, resulting in significant
    annual savings. In addition, the company substantially reduced its server infrastructure
    from 110 physical servers to 60 virtual servers running on just five physical
    servers. The combined solution also allowed the organization to reduce the number
    of developers needed to a third of their original number.

    costs, which was evident when the organization decided to upgrade to Microsoft
    Dynamics AX 2009 Service Pack 1\. The company's IT Director had this to say about
    the upgrade process. "Previously, it would take a large team months to roll out
    an upgrade. But when upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 Service Pack 1, we
    only needed to spare a few of our staff and they completed it in three weeks."
