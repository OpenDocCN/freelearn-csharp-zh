			<h1 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Building a User Interface</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will be exploring how to build a web-based frontend using Blazor, a client-side web framework that interfaces with the .NET web API backend that we built up in previous chapters. Blazor is a powerful and flexible framework that allows us to write C# code that runs in the browser, enabling us to create rich and interactive web applications with a single code base.</p>
			<p>We will start by looking at the many important techniques that you will have to understand before building a user interface. These will be tasks such as generating user personas, building user journeys, wireframing, and creating tickets.</p>
			<p>After we have covered the background work, we will start by modifying the Dockerized development environment to facilitate frontend development and creating a new Blazor project. We will also explore the basic structure of a Blazor application, including the components, pages, and layouts.</p>
			<p>Next, we will cover how to connect to a .NET web API backend. We will show how to consume data from the web API, using the client code to call the API endpoints and retrieve the data, and display it in the user interface.</p>
			<p>We will then dive into the details of designing the user interface, including creating the layout, designing the components, and adding the necessary controls and elements to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to build a Blazor frontend that connects to a .NET web API backend, and how to create a responsive and scalable web application that provides a seamless UX for your customers.</p>
			<p>The main topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A general introduction to the tech stack</li>
				<li>How to make sure your app serves your customers</li>
				<li>Some practical examples of how to build a UI with Blazor</li>
				<li>How to interact with the backend</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Introduction to the tech stack</h1>
			<p>There are many options available<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> to build a frontend for a SaaS application. Angular and React are popular JavaScript-based frameworks that are commonly used and are as good a choice as any to build a frontend for a SaaS application. However, as this is a .NET-focused book, we will stick to .NET technology and use Blazor.</p>
			<p>Blazor is a modern web application framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to build client-side web applications, using C# and .NET instead of JavaScript. Blazor was first introduced as an experimental project in 2018 and was later released as part of .NET Core 3.0 in 2019. The main goal of Blazor is to enable developers to write full-stack web applications entirely in C# and .NET, providing a more familiar and productive development experience.</p>
			<p>Blazor is designed to solve the problem of developing and maintaining complex, data-driven web applications that require a lot of client-side interactivity, such as a SaaS application. With Blazor, developers can write code that runs in a browser using WebAssembly, enabling them to create rich and interactive user interfaces without relying on JavaScript. Blazor also provides a wide range of built-in features and tools, such as routing, data binding, and form validation, which can help developers to build complex web applications more quickly and easily.</p>
			<p>Blazor has become popular in recent years due to its ease of use, flexibility, and productivity. By allowing developers to use C# and .NET on the client side, Blazor provides a more consistent and familiar development experience, reducing the learning curve and enabling developers to be more productive. Additionally, Blazor’s tight integration with .NET provides a seamless development experience, with built-in debugging, testing, and deployment tools.</p>
			<p>Blazor is particularly suitable to build SaaS applications because it provides a scalable and reliable development platform that can handle a large number of users and data. Blazor’s ability to interface with .NET web API backends makes it a powerful tool to create a complete end-to-end solution, with a robust backend and a responsive frontend. Additionally, Blazor’s built-in features and tools to handle user input, data validation, and security make<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> it an ideal choice to build complex and secure SaaS applications.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>What is WebAssembly?</h2>
			<p>WebAssembly<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> is a low-level binary format that enables the execution of code in a web browser. It is a portable, stack-based virtual machine that runs alongside JavaScript and provides a faster and more efficient way to execute code in the browser. WebAssembly is designed to work in conjunction with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing developers to write web applications using a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, Rust, and AssemblyScript.</p>
			<p>WebAssembly is different from JavaScript in that it is a compiled language, whereas JavaScript is an interpreted language. This means that code written in WebAssembly can be precompiled, making it faster to load and execute in the browser. Additionally, WebAssembly provides a more secure and sandboxed execution environment, which can help prevent security vulnerabilities and improve the reliability of web applications.</p>
			<p>WebAssembly is becoming increasingly popular as a way to build web applications, especially for performance-intensive tasks such as gaming, image and video processing, and scientific simulations. With the increasing popularity of tools and frameworks such as Blazor, WebAssembly is also used more frequently in the context of building client-side web applications using languages other than JavaScript. Overall, WebAssembly is an exciting and powerful technology that changes the way we think about building web applications and enables a new era of innovation on the web.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>The development environment</h2>
			<p>So far, we have done<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> all of our work in Visual Studio Code. We have added<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> extensions that allow us to manipulate .NET projects, host and interact with databases, and also execute tests on an API.</p>
			<p>I selected Visual Studio Code for the examples in this book because it is free, cross-platform, and allows us to do all sorts of things without requiring lots of tools to be installed. Furthermore, I have used dev containers to try to ensure that everything will “just work,” regardless of what computer you are running on.</p>
			<p>I think this is really cool and also very practical when putting together a demo app in a book. I will continue this philosophy for this chapter on building a UI, but I need to acknowledge at this point that the development environment in the “main” Visual Studio application is superior to Blazor. I hope this will change in the near future and that this chapter will stand the test of time.</p>
			<p>For the purposes of the simple<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> example that I present here, Visual Studio Code<a id="_idIndexMarker449"/> is fine. If you are building a more complex real-world project, then you may want to invest in Visual Studio.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>UX considerations – knowing your customer</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">User experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>) is of paramount importance in modern<a id="_idIndexMarker450"/> application development. How a user interacts with your SaaS application is crucial, as poor UX can result in user frustration and abandonment. Therefore, considering<a id="_idIndexMarker451"/> the user’s experience should be the most important part of the process when designing a UI.</p>
			<p>At its core, UX is the practice of designing digital products, services, and systems that are useful, usable, and enjoyable for the people who use them. In today’s digital age, where people interact with technology on a daily basis, UX has become increasingly important to create successful products and services. Good UX can enhance a user’s satisfaction, engagement, and loyalty, while bad UX can result in frustration, confusion, and abandonment. UX design involves understanding user needs, goals, and behaviors, and using that knowledge to inform the design of UIs and interactions. It encompasses a range of disciplines, including visual design, interaction design, information architecture, and user research, among others. As digital products and services continue to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives, UX will continue to be a critical factor in their success.</p>
			<p>UX is important, but it is also a complex and multifaceted field that can be challenging to master. While there are some scientific methods and principles that can be applied to UX design, such as user research, usability testing, and data analysis, the process of creating a great UX often involves a significant amount of artistry and creativity. Unlike some other fields, there are no absolute right or wrong answers in UX design, and what works for one user or product may not work for another. UX designers must balance a wide range of considerations, including user needs, business goals, technical constraints, and visual aesthetics, among others. This requires a combination of analytical skills, design skills, and intuition to create a UX that is both effective and aesthetically pleasing. In short, while there are scientific methods and principles that can help guide UX design, there is still a significant amount of artistry involved in creating great UXs.</p>
			<p>In the context of SaaS applications, UX is even more important than it is in other types of software. SaaS applications<a id="_idIndexMarker452"/> are typically subscription-based, meaning that users pay for access to the software on an ongoing basis. This means that they have the option to switch to a competitor at any time if they are not satisfied with the service they are receiving. In other words, SaaS companies are in a constant battle to retain their users, and poor UX can be the deciding factor in whether a user stays or goes. Additionally, SaaS applications are often complex and feature-rich, with a wide range of options and settings. This can make the UX even more challenging to design, as users need to be able to find what they are looking for quickly and easily. As a result, designing a great UX is crucial to the success of a SaaS application, as it can help to increase user satisfaction, reduce churn, and ultimately drive the success of the business.</p>
			<p>In this section, I’ll give some general pointers that may be useful to consider when you build a SaaS application.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>User personas</h2>
			<p>User personas are fictional characters<a id="_idIndexMarker453"/> that represent different types of users who may interact with an application. They are developed by gathering information about real users through surveys, interviews, and other forms of research. UX designers use this information to create a set of user personas that represent the different needs, behaviors, and motivations of their target users. User personas are important in the UX design process because they help to create a clear understanding of the people who will be using the application. By understanding the characteristics of the different personas, designers can make informed decisions about how to structure the UI, what features to include, and how to prioritize different aspects of the UX. For example, if the target audience includes some individuals who are tech-savvy individuals and some less technically proficient, the designer may need to create a UI that is both intuitive and easy to navigate. By creating user personas, UX designers can ensure that the design of the application is centered around the needs and expectations of its users, which can ultimately lead to a better UX and greater user satisfaction.</p>
			<p>Here is an example of a possible fictional tech-savvy user called “Sara”:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Sara is a tech-savvy user who uses multiple devices and is comfortable with technology. She has a good understanding of technology trends and new applications and enjoys exploring new features and settings in an application. Sara prefers to use the latest technology and applications and may be interested in using keyboard shortcuts and other power-user features in an application. She is comfortable with troubleshooting issues and finding solutions independently, and may have a lower tolerance for slow load times or other technical issues. If an application does not meet her expectations, she may be more likely to abandon it. Overall, Sara is a user who is comfortable with technology and has high expectations for the applications she uses, and the design of the application should reflect her needs </em><em class="italic">and expectations.</em></p>
			<p>Creating an avatar for a user persona is useful for designers and developers because it helps to create empathy and a better understanding of the user’s needs, goals, and behaviors. We have created<a id="_idIndexMarker454"/> the following avatar for Sara!</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19343_07_1.jpg" alt="Figure 7.1 – An avatar for Sara"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.1 – An avatar for Sara</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>User journey mapping</h2>
			<p>User journey mapping is a visual representation<a id="_idIndexMarker455"/> of the steps a user takes to complete a task within an application, from the initial point of contact through to the completion of the task. User journey mapping is important because it helps to identify pain points and areas of frustration in the UX, as well as opportunities for improvement. By mapping the user journey, designers can get a clear picture of how users interact with the application and where they may encounter issues. This information can then be used to refine the design and make the UX more streamlined and intuitive. User journey mapping is related to user personas because it helps to create a more detailed understanding of how different personas interact with the application. By mapping the user journey for different personas, designers can identify how the UX differs between different types of users and make design decisions that are tailored to the needs of each persona. Ultimately, user journey mapping is a valuable tool to create a user-centered design that meets the needs of all users.</p>
			<p>Here’s an example of a user journey for Sara, a tech-savvy user of the <code>GoodHabit</code> database:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Sara navigates to the <code>GoodHabits</code> app<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> and logs in.</li>
				<li>The app displays a page with a list of Sara’s existing habits on the left side of the screen and an empty add/edit form on the right side of the screen.</li>
				<li>Sara clicks on the <strong class="bold">Add New</strong> button under the list of habits.</li>
				<li>The app populates the form with default values and changes the button text to <strong class="bold">Save New</strong>.</li>
				<li>Sara fills out the form and clicks on the <strong class="bold">Save </strong><strong class="bold">New</strong> button.</li>
				<li>The app validates the form data and creates the new habit, associating it with Sara’s user account.</li>
				<li>The app adds the new habit to the list on the left side of the screen, and the habit is automatically selected.</li>
				<li>The app updates the form on the right side of the screen with the new habit’s data and changes the button text to <strong class="bold">Save Changes</strong>.</li>
				<li>Sara can make further changes to the habit if desired, and then she clicks on the <strong class="bold">Save </strong><strong class="bold">Changes</strong> button.</li>
				<li>The app validates the form data and updates the habit with the new data.</li>
				<li>The app highlights the updated habit on the list on the left side of the screen to indicate that it has been modified.</li>
				<li>Sara verifies that the new habit has been added or updated successfully and is displayed correctly on the list.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Writing out these user journeys can be very useful for the design team, and also for the dev team, to better understand how users will interact with a system. A good understanding of these interactions will result in a better experience for the users, which will generally lead to the SaaS app generating more revenue!</p>
			<p>It should not be assumed<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> that everyone who uses your SaaS app will have the same level of abilities, and it is also very important to consider accessibility.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Accessibility</h2>
			<p>Accessibility refers<a id="_idIndexMarker458"/> to the practice<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> of designing digital products and content in a way that ensures that they are usable by people with disabilities. This includes people with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments, among others. Accessibility is important because it helps to ensure that all users, regardless of their abilities, can access and use digital products and content. This not only benefits individuals with disabilities but also has broader social and economic benefits, as it helps to create a more inclusive society.</p>
			<p>Here are some tips and things<a id="_idIndexMarker460"/> to consider when designing for accessibility:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Providing alternative text for images so that users with visual impairments can understand the content of an image</li>
				<li>Ensuring that the color contrast between text and the background is sufficient so that users with visual impairments can read the text easily</li>
				<li>Providing closed captions or transcripts for videos and audio content so that users with auditory impairments can understand the content</li>
				<li>Using semantic HTML to ensure that assistive technologies can accurately parse and interpret the content of a web page</li>
				<li>Ensuring that an application is operable using keyboard-only navigation so that users with motor impairments can use an application easily</li>
				<li>Providing clear and concise instructions and feedback so that users with cognitive impairments can understand and use an application effectively</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It may be helpful to create some user personas to represent users who will benefit from these accessibility considerations, building some user journeys specifically for them.</p>
			<p>Designing for accessibility is an important consideration for any digital product or content, helping to create<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> a more inclusive<a id="_idIndexMarker462"/> and accessible society.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Visually appealing design</h2>
			<p>While UX always blends art and science<a id="_idIndexMarker463"/> to some extent, creating a visually appealing design leans much more on artistic creativity. It is easy to overlook this when building an application and focus on the more technical aspects. However, having a visually appealing design is an important aspect of UX and can have a significant impact on how users perceive and interact with digital products and content. A well-designed UI can make it easier for users to understand and navigate an application, and it can create a sense of trust and credibility that is important to build a strong brand. A visually appealing design should be aesthetically pleasing and engaging, while also being functional and usable. This means using a consistent color scheme, typography, and layout that is easy on the eyes and provides a clear visual hierarchy. It also means using appropriate imagery and graphics that enhance content and support the overall UX. Ultimately, a visually appealing design should be intuitive, easy to use, and engaging, helping to create a positive UX for all users.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>Navigation and information architecture</h2>
			<p>UX design should strive to make the navigation<a id="_idIndexMarker464"/> of an application simple <a id="_idIndexMarker465"/>and intuitive for users. This means designing<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> a clear and consistent menu structure, as well as providing helpful labels and descriptions for each menu item. The navigation should be easily accessible from any page within the application and enable users to quickly and easily move between different areas of it.</p>
			<p>In a SaaS app, users often try to accomplish a specific task or goal, and they need to be able to easily find the content and features they need to accomplish that task. Effective navigation can help users quickly and easily move between different areas of an app, without getting lost or confused.</p>
			<p>Information architecture<a id="_idIndexMarker467"/> is the process of organizing and structuring the content within an application in a logical and meaningful way. It involves grouping related content together, creating hierarchies of information, and establishing clear relationships between different pieces of content. A well-designed information architecture can make it easier for users to find the information they need, and it can also help to provide context and meaning for the content within the application. When designing the information architecture, it is important to consider the needs and goals of the users, as well as the content that is being presented, in order to create a structure that is clear, intuitive, and effective.</p>
			<p>Information architecture<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> is important for a SaaS app because it can help to ensure that the content within the app is organized in a way that is intuitive and meaningful for users. This can help users to better understand and engage with the content, and it can also make it easier for them to find the information they need. By designing a clear and effective information architecture, SaaS app designers<a id="_idIndexMarker469"/> can create an experience<a id="_idIndexMarker470"/> that is both functional and enjoyable for users, helping to build brand loyalty and customer satisfaction.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>Responsive design</h2>
			<p>Responsive design<a id="_idIndexMarker471"/> is a design approach<a id="_idIndexMarker472"/> that aims to create digital products that adapt and respond to different screen sizes and device types. This has become increasingly popular as more and more users access websites and applications on a wide variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. With responsive design, the layout, content, and functionality of a website or application are optimized for each device type, allowing users to have a consistent and seamless experience, regardless of the device they use.</p>
			<p>To achieve responsive design, UX designers typically use a combination of flexible layouts, fluid images, and media queries, which allow the design to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. This means that elements of the design, such as the navigation, content, and images, will adjust and reposition themselves based on the size of the screen, in order to provide the best UX possible.</p>
			<p>Responsive design helps to create a positive UX, as it ensures that users can access and use digital products on any device, at any time. With more and more users accessing the web and applications on mobile devices, responsive design has become a key consideration for UX designers and is essential to create a successful and accessible digital product.</p>
			<p>When considering a SaaS application, this becomes even more important, as customers of the application<a id="_idIndexMarker473"/> will often require<a id="_idIndexMarker474"/> that they can access the app at any time, and on any device.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Feedback and user testing</h2>
			<p>Feedback and user testing<a id="_idIndexMarker475"/> are essential<a id="_idIndexMarker476"/> to create a successful UX, as they allow designers to gather insights and information from real users about the usability, functionality, and effectiveness of their designs. This feedback can be used to identify areas of the design that work well, as well as areas that need improvement, helping designers to refine and optimize the UX.</p>
			<p>To collect feedback and user testing data, UX designers use a variety of techniques, including surveys, interviews, usability testing, and user analytics. Surveys and interviews can help designers to collect qualitative feedback about the UX, including likes, dislikes, and pain points. Usability testing, on the other hand, involves observing users as they interact with the design, providing valuable insights into how users use an application, as well as areas of the design that may be causing confusion or frustration. User analytics can also be used to gather data about user behavior, such as how often users access certain features, or where they drop off in the user journey.</p>
			<p>Once feedback and user testing data have been collected, designers can use them to inform and guide their design decisions, making changes and optimizations based on the insights gathered from real users. By incorporating feedback and user testing into the design process, UX designers can create a more user-centric and effective UX, leading to higher engagement, satisfaction, and customer loyalty.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Building a simple UI</h1>
			<p>You may recall that way back in <a href="B19343_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, we created a Blazor<a id="_idIndexMarker477"/> application. We will now start to build this out.</p>
			<p>Earlier in this chapter, we imagined a user persona called Sara, and we described a user journey where Sara adds a new good habit to her database. In this section, we will build out that user journey!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Planning the UI</h2>
			<p>Building a good UI is a complex process<a id="_idIndexMarker478"/> that involves careful planning and thoughtful execution. Before starting to create the UI, it’s essential to take the time to plan out the layout, design, and functionality of an application. This planning should encompass everything, from the UX to user interviews, wireframing, and prototyping.</p>
			<p>The first step in planning a UI is to define the user personas and UX. Understanding a user’s needs and the goals of an application is essential to create an interface that is both usable and engaging. One way to accomplish this is by conducting user interviews, which can help to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement. This feedback can then be used to shape the design and functionality of the UI.</p>
			<p>Once the user personas and UX are defined, it’s time to start thinking about the layout of the UI. Wireframing and prototyping are useful techniques to visualize the layout and design of the interface. These techniques allow designers to experiment with different ideas and make sure the application is intuitive and easy to navigate. Wireframes are basic sketches of the interface that help to establish the overall layout, while prototypes are interactive mock-ups that allow users to interact with the UI and give feedback.</p>
			<p>In addition to wireframing and prototyping, it’s important to consider the technical aspects of the application. This includes choosing the right technology stack, such as the appropriate framework and tools. For instance, Blazor is a popular framework to create UIs using C# and .NET, and it is an excellent choice to build a SaaS application.</p>
			<p>Overall, planning the UI is a crucial step in creating a simple yet effective interface for a SaaS application. It involves considering the UX, conducting user interviews, wireframing and prototyping, and choosing the appropriate technology stack. With careful planning, it’s possible to create a UI that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, which will ultimately help to improve user engagement and satisfaction.</p>
			<p>So that we can make progress, let’s assume that I have done all of the preceding and decided that the following represents the ideal UI for the Good Habits SaaS application.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19343_07_2.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2 – A mock﻿-up ﻿of the Good Habits app"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.2 – A mock-up of the Good Habits app</p>
			<p>The preceding screenshot represents<a id="_idIndexMarker479"/> a very basic UI that allows a user to see a list of their habits, add<a id="_idIndexMarker480"/> a new one, and edit or delete existing habits. This is basically just a simple <strong class="bold">Create, Read, Update, Delete</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRUD</strong>) implementation that would probably make a UX designer cry, but it will suffice for this demo!</p>
			<h3>Configuring the environment</h3>
			<p>As we will stick to Visual Studio Code<a id="_idIndexMarker481"/> to build the UI, we will add some extensions to make our lives a bit easier. As always, we’ll do this by modifying <code>devcontainer.json</code> and add to the extensions array. Add the following extensions:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
"kevin-chatham.aspnetcorerazor-html-css-class-completion",
"syncfusioninc.blazor-vscode-extensions",
"ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime",
"ms-dotnettools.blazorwasm-companion"</pre>
			<p>These extensions will make our lives much easier as we build out this UI!</p>
			<p>You will need to exit and re-enter the dev container environment<a id="_idIndexMarker482"/> so that the changes can be applied.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Writing a ticket</h2>
			<p>In software<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> development, a “ticket” is a term used to describe<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> a unit of work that needs<a id="_idIndexMarker485"/> to be done on a project. Tickets are usually created to track bugs, feature requests, and any other tasks that need to be completed by the development team. They provide a way for project managers and developers to keep track of what needs to be done, who is responsible for completing a task, and the status of the work. Tickets can be as simple as a bug report or feature request, or they can be very detailed and include requirements, designs, and other documentation. The use of tickets helps to keep the development process organized and efficient, ensuring that everyone on a team is working toward the same goals.</p>
			<p>Gherkin<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> is a language that is often used to write specifications for software development projects, and it can be used when creating tickets. It is designed to be easy to understand by both technical and non-technical stakeholders, and it helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to what needs to be done. Gherkin specifications are written in a specific format that is easy to read and understand, and they can be used to create automated tests that ensure that the software meets the requirements that have been specified. By using Gherkin to write tickets, developers can ensure that the work they do is directly tied to the needs of a project and that everyone on a team understands what needs to be done and why. This can help to reduce confusion and misunderstandings, leading to a more efficient and effective development process.</p>
			<p>Gherkin is a plain-text, domain-specific language that is commonly used to assist in the writing of automated acceptance tests for software applications. It is designed to be human-readable and easy to understand by stakeholders, developers, and testers alike. Gherkin provides a simple syntax to define the behavior of an application in a structured and organized way, using a set of keywords and phrases.</p>
			<p>One of the key benefits<a id="_idIndexMarker487"/> of using Gherkin to write UI tickets is that it helps to ensure clarity and consistency across the development team. By using a standardized format to describe the desired behavior of a UI, everyone involved in the development process can understand what is expected and how to implement it. Gherkin also provides a common language that can be used to communicate between team members with different backgrounds and expertise.</p>
			<p>Another advantage<a id="_idIndexMarker488"/> of using Gherkin for UI tickets is that it promotes a user-centric approach to software development. By focusing on the desired user behavior and experience, Gherkin encourages developers to build applications that are intuitive, easy to use, and meet the needs of the end user. This approach can lead to more effective testing and a better overall UX.</p>
			<p>Gherkin is a powerful tool<a id="_idIndexMarker489"/> to write UI tickets that can help to promote<a id="_idIndexMarker490"/> clarity, consistency, and user-centered design in software development. By providing a common language and structured format to describe behavior, Gherkin can help to ensure that everyone involved in the development process understands what is expected and how to achieve it. Additionally, by enabling automated testing, Gherkin can help to catch issues early and ensure a high-quality end product.</p>
			<p>Here is an example of a ticket that could be used to describe the user journey that we defined for Sara previously. We will use this ticket to guide us in the development of the UI:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Feature: Add a new habit to the list
Scenario: User adds a new habit to the list
Given Sara is on the Good Habits page
And there is a button labeled "Add new"
When Sara clicks the "Add new" button
Then a form for adding a new habit should appear
And the form should have input fields for the habit name, description, and category
And the form should have a "Save" button
And the form should have a "Cancel" button
Scenario: User saves a new habit to the list
Given Sara has filled out the form for adding a new habit
When she clicks the "Save" button
Then the new habit should be added to the list
And the list should show the habit name, description, and category
And the new habit should be displayed at the top of the list
And the new habit should be highlighted to indicate it has been added successfully
And the form for adding a new habit should disappear</pre>
			<p>The preceding ticket gives us a roadmap to follow to develop the UI. Coupled with the wireframe that we have created previously, it should <a id="_idIndexMarker491"/>be easy to build<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> this simple UI!</p>
			<p>But before we get started building, let’s take a quick look at the technology that we will use!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>What is Blazor?</h2>
			<p>Blazor is a modern<a id="_idIndexMarker493"/> web framework<a id="_idIndexMarker494"/> to build interactive web UIs using C# and .NET. It allows developers to write web applications using the same familiar language and tools that are used for desktop and mobile applications, as well as for RESTful APIs. Blazor supports two models to build web applications – Blazor WebAssembly and Blazor Server.</p>
			<p>Blazor WebAssembly is a client-side model<a id="_idIndexMarker495"/> that allows developers to build web applications entirely in C# and run them in any modern web browser, without the need for any server-side code. The application is loaded and executed directly in the browser, and any communication with the server is performed using standard web technologies such as HTTP and WebSockets – frequently using a WebAPI backend, which we used in previous chapters. Blazor WebAssembly<a id="_idIndexMarker496"/> applications can run both online and offline, making them suitable to build progressive web applications.</p>
			<p>Blazor Server is a server-side model that allows developers<a id="_idIndexMarker497"/> to build web applications, using a similar programming model to client-side Blazor but with the server running the application code and rendering the UI in the browser. In this model, the application code runs on the server, and the UI is streamed to the client as HTML and JavaScript. This allows Blazor Server applications to have the same rich interactive features as client-side applications but with a higher degree of control over the UX.</p>
			<p>Both models of Blazor provide<a id="_idIndexMarker498"/> developers with a powerful and modern way to build web applications, with the choice between client-side and server-side, depending on the specific requirements of a project. Blazor’s use of C# and .NET makes it a compelling option for developers who are already familiar with these technologies, and the ability to share code between the web and other types of applications can lead to greater efficiency and productivity. Additionally, Blazor’s support for Razor syntax and integration with Visual Studio and other development tools makes it a familiar and comfortable environment for developers to work in.</p>
			<p>For this example, we will use Blazor WebAssembly (Wasm). This is a good choice when building a SaaS application with a RESTful API backend for a few reasons, some of which are stated here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Wasm runs entirely<a id="_idIndexMarker499"/> in the browser, which means that a user does not need to wait for server responses to load the application. This can result in faster load times, better UX, and reduced server load.</li>
				<li>Because the application runs entirely in the browser, it can be made available offline. This is particularly useful for users who are on the go and do not have access to reliable internet connections.</li>
				<li>Wasm allows more efficient processing of complex computations and graphics-intensive applications, which is particularly relevant for SaaS applications that may require a lot of data processing or advanced graphics.</li>
				<li>By offloading more of the processing to the client side, a Wasm-based SaaS application can reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent back and forth between a server and a client. This can result in reduced bandwidth requirements, faster load times, and reduced server load.</li>
				<li>Wasm can provide better security for SaaS applications, as it runs in a sandboxed environment, which makes it more difficult for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities in the application.</li>
				<li>Because Wasm is platform-agnostic, SaaS applications<a id="_idIndexMarker500"/> built using Wasm can be run on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This can help to increase the reach of the application and make it more accessible to users.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>Setting up the Blazor project</h2>
			<p>We already set up a Blazor project in <a href="B19343_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, but I’ll recap<a id="_idIndexMarker501"/> the steps here. Open a console and type in the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">dotnet new blazorwasm -o GoodHabits.Client</strong>
<strong class="bold">cd GoodHabits.Client</strong></pre>
			<p>Great! You can now start the client by typing <code>dotnet run</code> into the console. You’ll see the following in the browser:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19343_07_3.jpg" alt="Figure 7.3 – The Hello, world! Blazor app"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.3 – The Hello, world! Blazor app</p>
			<p>We’ll start with this template and make it look a bit more like the mock-up. Initially, we will use dummy data, but we will connect<a id="_idIndexMarker502"/> the frontend up to the API – by the end of this chapter, we will have a full stack SaaS application!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Building the UI</h2>
			<p>First, there is a small amount<a id="_idIndexMarker503"/> of config required in <code>Program.cs</code> in the client application. Make the class look like the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting;
using GoodHabits.Client;
var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);
builder.RootComponents.Add&lt;App&gt;("#app");
builder.RootComponents.Add&lt;HeadOutlet&gt;("head::after");
var apiBaseAddress = "http://localhost:5300/gateway/";
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp =&gt; new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(apiBaseAddress) });
await builder.Build().RunAsync();</pre>
			<p>Note that the preceding base address connects to the API gateway that we configured in <a href="B19343_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor140"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>.</p>
			<p>With that small piece of config done, we can get started with the functionality by adding a new page that will display the information we built up in the database in the previous chapters. We will also modify the navigation menu to link to this new page, removing the sample pages.</p>
			<p>In the <code>Pages</code> folder, you can delete the <code>Counter.razor</code> and <code>FetchData.razor</code> files and add a new file called <code>Habits.razor</code>. Your <code>Pages</code> folder should look like this:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19343_07_4.jpg" alt="Figure 7.4 – The Pages folder"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.4 – The Pages folder</p>
			<p>With the preceding configured, we can add some basic setup on the <code>Habits.razor</code> page. Open the file and copy<a id="_idIndexMarker504"/> in the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
@page "/goodhabits"
@inject HttpClient httpClient
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Good Habits&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Habit Details&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
@code {
    private List&lt;Habit&gt; GoodHabits { get; set; } = new
      List&lt;Habit&gt;()
    {
        new Habit { Name = "Drink water", Description =
          "Drink at least 8 glasses of water every day." },
        new Habit { Name = "Exercise", Description = "Do at
          least 30 minutes of exercise every day." },
        new Habit { Name = "Meditation", Description =
          "Meditate for at least 10 minutes every day." },
    };
    private class Habit
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; } = default!;
        public string Description { get; set; } = default!;
    }
}</pre>
			<p>The preceding code will give us an outline<a id="_idIndexMarker505"/> that we can start to build upon. However, before we can see this in the app, we need to modify the navigation menu to link to this new page.</p>
			<p>Open the <code>Shared</code> folder and locate the <code>NavMenu.razor</code> file. Change the navigation menu code to match the following. Note that the <code>href</code> property matches what we set in the <code>@page</code> attribute on the <code>Habits.razor</code> page:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;div class="@NavMenuCssClass nav-scrollable" @onclick="ToggleNavMenu"&gt;
    &lt;nav class="flex-column"&gt;
        &lt;div class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
            &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href=""
              Match="NavLinkMatch.All"&gt;
                &lt;span class="oi oi-home" aria-
                  hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Home
            &lt;/NavLink&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
            &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="goodhabits"&gt;
                &lt;span class="oi oi-plus" aria-
                  hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Good Habits
            &lt;/NavLink&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
			<p>With the menu configured, we can now run<a id="_idIndexMarker506"/> the application with <code>dotnet run</code> and see the changes we have made.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19343_07_5.jpg" alt="Figure 7.5 – Starting to build the GoodHabits page"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.5 – Starting to build the GoodHabits page</p>
			<p>In the preceding screenshot, we can see that we have successfully added the navigation and sketched out the GoodHabits page! Let’s add some more functionality.</p>
			<p>We will start by modifying the code in the code block to allow us to view, add, edit, and delete the habits. We will shortly bind these functions to UI controls so that we can manipulate the habits in the list.</p>
			<p>In the <code>@code</code> block, start by adding some class-level variables:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private Habit? SelectedHabit { get; set; }
private Habit? EditingHabit { get; set; }
private Habit? AddingHabit { get; set; }
private bool IsEditing { get; set; } = false;</pre>
			<p>This will allow us to select<a id="_idIndexMarker507"/> a habit out of the list, edit that habit, and store a state variable that tells the view when we are editing.</p>
			<p>Next, add a function that allows us to select a habit:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private void ShowDetails(Habit habit)
{ SelectedHabit = habit;
  IsEditing = false;
}</pre>
			<p>Add a function that will allow us to add a new habit with some default properties to the list:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private void AddHabit()
{
  Habit newHabit = new Habit()
  {
    Name = "New Habit",
    Description = "Enter a description here"
  };
  GoodHabits.Add(newHabit);
  SelectedHabit = newHabit;
}</pre>
			<p>Add a function that will allow us to edit a habit:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private void EditHabit(Habit habit)
{
  SelectedHabit = habit;
  ShowEditForm();
}</pre>
			<p>Add a function that will allow us to delete a habit from the list:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private void DeleteHabit(Habit habit)
{
  GoodHabits.Remove(habit);
  if (SelectedHabit == habit)
  {
    SelectedHabit = null;
  }
}</pre>
			<p>Add a function<a id="_idIndexMarker508"/> that will allow us to edit a habit from the list:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private void ShowEditForm()
{
  IsEditing = true;
  EditingHabit = new Habit() {
    Id = SelectedHabit!.Id,
    Name = SelectedHabit!.Name,
    Description = SelectedHabit!.Description};
}</pre>
			<p>Add a function that will allow us to save a habit that we have been editing:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private void SaveHabit()
{
  GoodHabits.Add(EditingHabit!);
  GoodHabits.Remove(SelectedHabit!);
  IsEditing = false;
  SelectedHabit = null;
}</pre>
			<p>Finally, add a function that will allow us to cancel any edits that we made, should we change our minds:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private void CancelEdit()
{
  IsEditing = false;
  EditingHabit = null;
  SelectedHabit = null;
}</pre>
			<p>That should allow us to manipulate<a id="_idIndexMarker509"/> the habits in the list! Now, we will add the UI and bind the elements to the functions that we just created!</p>
			<p>We’ll start by adding the list of habits to the left-hand pane. Copy the following HTML in directly under the <code>&lt;h3&gt;Good Habits&lt;/h3&gt;</code> line in the HTML:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;ul class="list-group"&gt;
    @foreach (var habit in GoodHabits)
    {
        &lt;li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-
          between align-items-center"&gt;
            &lt;span @onclick="() =&gt;
              ShowDetails(habit)"&gt;@habit.Name&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;i class="oi oi-eye mr-2 text-primary"
                  @onclick="() =&gt; ShowDetails(habit)"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
                &lt;i class="oi oi-pencil mr-2 text-primary"
                  @onclick="() =&gt; EditHabit(habit)"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
                &lt;i class="oi oi-trash text-danger"
                  @onclick="() =&gt; DeleteHabit(habit)"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    }
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;button class="btn btn-primary mt-3" @onclick="AddHabit"&gt;Add Habit&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
			<p>You can see that we loop<a id="_idIndexMarker510"/> over the list of dummy habits that we included in the code block, binding these habits to the functions that we added to the <code>@code</code> block. We have added buttons to add, edit, and delete the habits in the list.</p>
			<p>Finally, we need to add the HTML to display or edit the habit on the right-hand side of the screen. Add the following HTML directly under the <code>&lt;h3&gt;Habit </code><code>Details&lt;/h3&gt;</code> element:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
@if (SelectedHabit != null)
{
    &lt;div class="card"&gt;
        &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
            @if (!IsEditing)
            {
                &lt;h5 class="card-
                  title"&gt;@SelectedHabit.Name&lt;/h5&gt;
                &lt;p class="card-
                  text"&gt;@SelectedHabit.Description&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;button class="btn btn-danger mt-3"
                  @onclick="() =&gt; DeleteHabit
                  (SelectedHabit)"&gt;Delete Habit&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;button class="btn btn-primary mt-3"
                  @onclick="() =&gt; ShowEditForm()"&gt;Edit
                  Habit&lt;/button&gt;
            }
            else
            {
                &lt;form&gt;
                    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
                        &lt;label for="edit-habit-
                          name"&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
                        &lt;input type="text" class="form-
                          control" id="edit-habit-name"
                          placeholder="Enter habit name"
                          @bind-value="EditingHabit.Name"
                          /&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
                        &lt;label for="edit-habit-
                          description"&gt;Description&lt;/label&gt;
                        &lt;textarea class="form-control"
                          id="edit-habit-description"
                          rows="3" @bind=
                          "EditingHabit.Description"&gt;
                          &lt;/textarea&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-
                      primary mt-3" @onclick="() =&gt;
                      SaveHabit()"&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;button type="button" class="btn btn-
                      secondary mt-3" @onclick="() =&gt;
                      CancelEdit()"&gt;Cancel&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
            }
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
}</pre>
			<p>There is quite a lot going on here. We have added<a id="_idIndexMarker511"/> two forms, one that is shown if the <code>IsEditing</code> property is set to <code>true</code> and one that is shown if it is not, allowing us to view or edit the habits.</p>
			<p>The best way to understand what is happening is to start the project and see what we have created!</p>
			<p>Type <code>dotnet run</code> into the console and go to the site in a browser. Then, navigate to the GoodHabits page, and you should see the following:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19343_07_6.jpg" alt=" Figure 7.6 – The Good Habits UI"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> Figure 7.6 – The Good Habits UI</p>
			<p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, we have a list of habits, and clicking on the name of any of these will bring up the “view” form.</p>
			<p>The UI should be fairly intuitive, if not very pretty! I think it is a very useful exercise to play with this UI and look at how the various functions and elements we added to the Razor file interact.</p>
			<p>So far, we have a functional UI, but there<a id="_idIndexMarker512"/> is no connection to that backend yet. Let’s work on that now!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Connecting the UI to the backend</h1>
			<p>Previously, we built the UI<a id="_idIndexMarker513"/> and added the functionality<a id="_idIndexMarker514"/> to add, delete, view, and update the habits. However, currently, there is no connection to the API that we have built up. Let’s remedy that now!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Dealing with CORS issues</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">CORS</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</strong>. It’s a mechanism that allows<a id="_idIndexMarker515"/> web pages to make requests<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> to a different domain than the one that served the web page. CORS is a security feature that helps to prevent unauthorized access to web servers. When a web page attempts to make a cross-origin request, the server it makes the request to must respond with specific headers that allow the request to go through. If the server does not send these headers, the browser will block the request.</p>
			<p>We need to configure the API gateway project to accept connections from any origin when in development mode. Please note that this represents a security risk and should not be replicated in production.</p>
			<p>Open up <code>Program.cs</code> in the <code>API Gateway</code> project (<em class="italic">not in the Blazor project – make sure you are in the correct </em><code>Program.cs</code><em class="italic"> file!!</em>). Locate the development settings:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{…}</pre>
			<p>Now, make sure that the following code is included:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    app.UseCors(policy =&gt;
        policy.AllowAnyOrigin()
              .AllowAnyHeader()
              .AllowAnyMethod()
              );</pre>
			<p>This will ensure that the API<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> will accept requests, but again, this is only suitable in development and not suitable for a production environment!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Logic, including calling the API</h2>
			<p>We will modify the code<a id="_idIndexMarker518"/> that we built previously to connect to the API. If we did our jobs well, and correctly separated the UI elements from the logic, we should be able to make this change by only modifying the code. Let’s see how we did!</p>
			<p>Start by adding a string constant that points to the API URL:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    private const string ServiceEndpoint = "http://localhost:5300/gateway/habits";</pre>
			<p>Make sure to set the port correctly. Also, note that hardcoding a URL is not really good practice, but it will suffice<a id="_idIndexMarker519"/> for this demo.</p>
			<p>Next, comment out or delete the three dummy habits that we added. From now on, we will get the habits that we stored in our database:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private List&lt;Habit&gt; GoodHabits { get; set; } = new List&lt;Habit&gt;();</pre>
			<p>We need to add a hook to fetch the habits from the database. We will tap into the initialization hooks and add the following method:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
    httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("tenant",
      "CloudSphere");
    GoodHabits = await
      httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync&lt;List&lt;Habit&gt;&gt;($"
      {ServiceEndpoint}");
}</pre>
			<p>This uses <code>httpClient</code> to call the API endpoint, which will return the list of habits that are stored in the database.</p>
			<p>Before we can add the calls to interact with the add and edit endpoints, we will need to create some classes. Add two private classes as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    private class CreateHabit
    {
        public string Name { get; set; } = default!;
        public string Description { get; set; } = default!;
        public int UserId { get; set; }
    }
    private class UpdateHabit
    {
        public string Name { get; set; } = default!;
        public string Description { get; set; } = default!;
    }</pre>
			<p>Next, modify the <code>AddHabit</code> method<a id="_idIndexMarker520"/> to interact with the API:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private async Task AddHabit()
{
    var newHabit = new CreateHabit()
    {
        Name = "New Habit",
        Description = "Enter a description here",
        UserId = 101
    };
    var response = await httpClient
      .PostAsJsonAsync(ServiceEndpoint, newHabit);
    var habit = await response
      .Content.ReadFromJsonAsync&lt;Habit&gt;();
    // Add the new habit to the list of habits
    GoodHabits.Add(habit!);
    SelectedHabit = habit;
}</pre>
			<p>Add a line<a id="_idIndexMarker521"/> to the <code>DeleteHabit</code> method:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    private void DeleteHabit(Habit habit)
    {
        httpClient.DeleteAsync($"{ServiceEndpoint}/
          {habit.Id}");
        GoodHabits.Remove(habit);
        if (SelectedHabit == habit)
        {
            SelectedHabit = null;
        }
    }</pre>
			<p>And finally, modify the <code>SaveHabit</code> method to include the required interactions:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    private void SaveHabit()
    {
        httpClient.PutAsJsonAsync($"{ServiceEndpoint}/
          {EditingHabit!.Id}",
                EditingHabit);
        GoodHabits.Add(EditingHabit!);
        GoodHabits.Remove(SelectedHabit!);
        IsEditing = false;
        SelectedHabit = null;
    }</pre>
			<p>That’s done! With just a few small changes, we are now hooked up to the API and the database. We have now created the outline of a fully functioning SaaS application!</p>
			<p>To prove this, go into the <strong class="bold">Run and Debug</strong> menu and execute the <strong class="bold">Run All</strong> compound task<a id="_idIndexMarker522"/> that we created in <a href="B19343_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor140"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>. This will start both the microservice projects, the API gateway, and the client project. Then, navigate to the client in the browser. You should see the contents of your habits database on the screen! We are much closer to completing our SaaS application!</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Building usable UIs</h1>
			<p>The example that we have built<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> here is a good technical demonstration of the essential techniques to incorporate the SaaS backend with a UI, but I think it’s safe to say that it lacks a bit of flair. These days, the average consumer expectations of a UI for a SaaS app are very high – essentially, customers will demand a very similar experience to a native application but running in a browser.</p>
			<p>To make a UI look more modern and responsive, we would typically use an off-the-shelf responsive UI framework. In addition to expecting the UI to perform like a desktop app, there is generally also an expectation that the UI should work on a tablet and a phone. Finally, not everyone shares the same abilities, and there are standard methods to endure that your UI is accessible to differently abled persons. In this section, we will look into all this, starting<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> with responsive UI frameworks.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Responsive UI frameworks</h2>
			<p>Responsive UI frameworks are a collection<a id="_idIndexMarker525"/> of pre-built components, styles, and scripts designed to help developers create responsive and adaptive web applications with ease. These frameworks provide developers with a set of tools that can be used to build UIs that automatically adjust to different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable UX across various platforms.</p>
			<p>The use of responsive UI frameworks can significantly streamline the development process by providing ready-to-use components and a cohesive design system. This enables developers to focus more on an application’s functionality and less on the complexities of building responsive layouts from scratch. Additionally, these frameworks typically adhere to well-established design principles and best practices, ensuring that the final product is not only visually appealing but also accessible and user-friendly.</p>
			<p>Bootstrap is an open source<a id="_idIndexMarker526"/> and widely used CSS framework developed by Twitter. It simplifies the process of creating responsive and mobile-first websites by providing a comprehensive set of reusable components, such as buttons, forms, and navigation elements. Bootstrap<a id="_idIndexMarker527"/> also includes a responsive grid system based on the <strong class="bold">Flexible Box Layout Module</strong> (<strong class="bold">Flexbox</strong>), making it easy to create fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. With its extensive documentation and large community, Bootstrap remains a popular choice among developers.</p>
			<p>Foundation, created by ZURB, is another<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> popular responsive frontend framework that focuses on providing a robust and flexible foundation to build custom web applications. It offers various pre-built components, a responsive grid system, and a modular architecture that enables developers to use only the components they need for their projects. Foundation is known for its performance optimizations and compatibility with a wide range of devices, making it a suitable choice for complex projects that require advanced customization and performance.</p>
			<p>Material-UI is a popular React-based UI framework<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> that implements Google’s Material Design guidelines. Material-UI provides a consistent and modern look and feel for web applications, ensuring that UIs are both visually appealing and easy to navigate. It includes a set of pre-built components, a responsive layout system, and a theming system that allows for easy customization. By following Material Design principles, Material-UI helps<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> developers create UIs that adhere to established usability standards.</p>
			<p>While Flexbox<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> is a powerful CSS layout module that simplifies the design of flexible and responsive layouts for web pages, it is not a full-fledged responsive UI framework. Instead, it is a valuable tool that can be used in conjunction with other frameworks to create adaptive layouts. Many responsive UI frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Foundation, incorporate Flexbox as part of their grid systems, leveraging its capabilities to create versatile and fluid layouts for their components.</p>
			<p>It is definitely recommended to choose one of these to integrate with your project. It would be an excellent<a id="_idIndexMarker532"/> learning exercise to apply one of these frameworks to the demo UI that we created previously!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Responsive design techniques</h2>
			<p>Simply installing one of the responsive frameworks<a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> described previously is not quite enough. You will need to master some of the techniques to get the most out of them.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will quickly explore the fundamental responsive design techniques, including fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries. By understanding and applying these techniques in conjunction with responsive UI frameworks, you can build usable UIs that provide a consistent and enjoyable experience across various platforms.</p>
			<p>Fluid grids form the backbone of responsive design by enabling flexible layouts that adjust dynamically, based on screen size. Instead of using fixed-width units such as pixels, fluid grids use relative units such as percentages to define the width of elements. This ensures that the layout automatically scales and reflows as the viewport changes. For example, when working with Bootstrap, you can create a fluid grid by utilizing its predefined grid classes, such as <code>.container</code>, <code>.row</code>, and <code>.col</code>. These classes enable you to define a responsive grid structure that adapts to different screen sizes.</p>
			<p>Flexible images ensure that media content, such as images and videos, also scales and adapts to different screen sizes. By setting the max-width property of images to 100%, images will automatically scale down to fit the width of their containing element, preventing them from overflowing and disrupting the layout. When working with frameworks such as Foundation or Material-UI, you can use their built-in classes or components to handle image scaling, ensuring that your media content remains responsive across various devices.</p>
			<p>Media queries are a powerful CSS feature that allows you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of a user’s device, such as screen size, resolution, or orientation. By using media queries, you can define breakpoints at which your layout and styles change, ensuring that your UI remains usable and visually appealing at different screen sizes. Most responsive UI frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Material-UI, provide predefined media queries and breakpoints that you can use or customize to suit your specific needs.</p>
			<p>By combining these core responsive design techniques with the features provided by responsive UI frameworks, you can create web applications that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and adaptable to various devices and screen sizes. This ultimately contributes to building<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> usable UIs that enhance the overall UX and cater to diverse user needs and preferences.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Designing for different screen sizes</h2>
			<p>These days, it is impossible to predict<a id="_idIndexMarker535"/> what device a user will choose<a id="_idIndexMarker536"/> to use to access your SaaS application. As a result, it’s crucial to consider different screen sizes and resolutions when designing responsive web applications. By doing so, you can ensure that your UIs look and function well across different devices, providing a consistent and enjoyable UX.</p>
			<p>When designing for different<a id="_idIndexMarker537"/> screen sizes, it’s essential to follow a few key guidelines and best practices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It can be very helpful to take a mobile-first approach. Start by designing your layout and UI for smaller screens, such as smartphones, and then progressively enhance the design for larger screens. This approach ensures that your application remains functional and visually appealing on smaller devices, while taking advantage of the additional screen real estate on larger ones.</li>
				<li>As mentioned earlier, responsive UI frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation, and Material-UI provide pre-built components, grid systems, and predefined media queries that make it easier to create adaptive layouts for various screen sizes. Leveraging these frameworks can significantly streamline the development process and ensure that your UIs remain consistent and functional across different devices. Remember to apply best practices and use good responsive design techniques!</li>
				<li>Always test on multiple devices and screen sizes. During the development process, test your application on a variety of devices and screen sizes to identify potential issues and ensure a consistent UX. You can use device emulators, browser developer tools, or physical devices to test your application’s responsiveness and make any necessary adjustments.</li>
				<li>Optimize your application’s performance for different devices, as slower load times and inefficient resource usage can significantly impact the UX, especially on mobile devices. Consider factors such as image optimization, code minification, and lazy loading<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> to improve the performance of your application across different screen sizes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By following these guidelines and best practices, you can create responsive web applications that provide a consistent <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>and enjoyable UX across various devices and screen sizes. Utilizing responsive UI frameworks and responsive design techniques will ensure that your UIs adapt seamlessly, catering to the diverse needs and preferences of your users.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>Accessibility</h2>
			<p>Creating accessible and inclusive web applications<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> is an essential aspect of responsible<a id="_idIndexMarker541"/> and empathetic design. By considering the needs of differently abled users, you ensure that your SaaS applications provide equal access and opportunities for everyone, fostering a more inclusive online environment.</p>
			<p>Embracing accessibility and inclusivity in your web applications is really important for a few reasons. Doing so gives a wider audience reach. By making your application accessible, you cater to a larger audience, including differently abled users, who might otherwise face barriers when interacting with your application.</p>
			<p>Generally speaking, a UI that is designed to be accessible will result in a better overall experience in general. Accessible design principles often result in better usability for all users, as they promote clear and intuitive interfaces that are easy to navigate and understand.</p>
			<p>Finally, it is the right thing <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/>to do. We should strive to make the internet, and indeed<a id="_idIndexMarker543"/> the world, a more inclusive place. If we can make a very tiny difference by taking the time to make our applications accessible, then we should!</p>
			<p>To create more accessible<a id="_idIndexMarker544"/> web applications, it’s important to follow established accessibility standards and guidelines, such as the <strong class="bold">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines </strong>(<strong class="bold">WCAG</strong>) and the <strong class="bold">Americans with Disabilities Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">ADA</strong>) Standards for Accessible Design. These guidelines provide a framework to ensure<a id="_idIndexMarker545"/> that your application is usable and accessible for differently abled users.</p>
			<p>There are several tools and techniques available to address common accessibility challenges and improve the UX for differently abled users:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Screen readers</strong>: These assistive technologies<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> convert text and other onscreen content into speech or braille, helping visually impaired users to access and navigate web applications. Ensure that your application’s content is structured semantically, with proper use of headings, landmarks, and alternative text for images to support screen reader users.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Keyboard navigation</strong>: Some users may rely solely on a keyboard<a id="_idIndexMarker547"/> to navigate web applications. Ensure that your application supports keyboard navigation by providing visible focus indicators, logical tab order, and keyboard-accessible interactive elements.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Color contrast</strong>: Users with visual impairments or color blindness<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> may have difficulty perceiving content with low contrast. Ensure that your application’s color scheme and design elements adhere to the recommended contrast ratios, as specified by the WCAG.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Accessible forms</strong>: Users with cognitive or motor impairments may struggle with complex forms<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> and input fields. Simplify forms, provide clear labels, and use proper input types to make it easier for all users to interact with your application.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)</strong>: This set of attributes helps enhance the accessibility<a id="_idIndexMarker550"/> of dynamic content<a id="_idIndexMarker551"/> and advanced UI controls. Use ARIA attributes to provide additional information about the structure and functionality of your application, ensuring that assistive technologies can interpret and interact with it correctly.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By considering the needs of differently abled users and implementing these tools and techniques, you can create<a id="_idIndexMarker552"/> web applications<a id="_idIndexMarker553"/> that are more accessible, inclusive, and user-friendly. This not only benefits your users but also contributes to the overall success of your application.</p>
