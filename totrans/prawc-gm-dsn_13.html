<div id="filepos891089" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Gameplay balancing</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The concept of <span class="bold">gameplay balancing</span> goes far beyond the qualities of individual objects and characters, and into the nature of play itself. Take a look at the classic example of a flawed game design, tic-tac-toe. Why is it flawed? The starting player can never lose. All they need to do is put their mark in the middle. This is a failure of both the design of the rules and the game's balance itself. The game has a single, dominant strategy, and once you figure it out or run into it, you're incentivized to replicate it. The presence of a dominant strategy drastically reduces a player's options. Once introduced into the play pattern, the game loses most of its appeal. Therefore, a wide possibility space is a defining feature of a well-balanced game.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">"Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game."</span></span></p><p class="calibre_118"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">–Soren Johnson, lead designer of Civilization IV, 2011.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Players are naturally inclined to fall into the safety of senseless repetition, a single move or combo in a fighting game, an optimized building order in an RTS, or the strongest known character class in an RPG. It's our job to make this kind of choice as hard as possible. Speaking of choices, why don’t you make one now?</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">You're stopped by a group of bandits. Pick your weapon: a rusty dagger or the Excalibur sword?</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Let’s not kid ourselves, this is not a compelling choice; it does nothing to expand your possibilities with an interesting (viable) strategy. And strategies are choices.</p><p class="calibre_2">Ask yourself, are you designing a puzzle or a game? Puzzles can be great fun, but they rely on a limited set of solutions. Once a puzzle is solved, it offers little replayability. Games that rely on puzzles often require a constant stream of new challenges. Non-puzzle games, on the other hand, are at their best when they are nearly impossible to solve. To get the most out of your game mechanics, you want solutions that are imperfect and shift depending on the situation. When asked "which weapon/gadget/car/character is the best?", the answer you should aim for is <span class="italic">it depends</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember, it's perfectly valid to have an optimal tool for a specific job, but what you should stay clear from is the perfect tool for every job. A compelling choice always comes with a trade-off of some sorts. The trade-off doesn't have to be the cost, time, reliability, or a risk of some sorts, it may just be the inability to do something equally interesting instead.</p><p class="calibre_2">Game balancing is a war of attrition. It often comes down to thousands of little changes, be it to the level design, the mechanics, or the game's data. In the beginning, everything you do will be an estimation, a ballpark. In these early phases, it's more important to set your data's structure than to achieve the best possible balance. Only after extensive playtesting, and with the help of subjective player feedback and objective analytics, will you be able to move towards true balance. And still, <span class="italic">true balance</span>, is more of an aspiration than a guaranteed result.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_799"/>


<div id="filepos894713" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Balancing methods and tips</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The following list of tips and tricks should help build an understanding of how to approach the process of game balancing. Right after that, we’ll share some of the actual balancing techniques that you can apply to your project!:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Start somewhere</span><br class="calibre1"/> Is 200 or 2,000 the right number of hit points? Well… that depends. When it comes to game balance, everything is relative. Plant a stake in the ground by setting one element that feels right, and then use it as a reference point for everything else.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Narrow your options</span><br class="calibre1"/> Avoid iterating in small increments. It's better to overshoot by a large margin to eliminate that option and increase the resolution of changes as you go along. First balancing attempts should be bold; the time for tiny 5% tweaks comes much later.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Use big integers</span><br class="calibre1"/> If possible, try to base data around values with at least a couple of digits. Numbers in their hundreds and thousands are easier to read and operate on than tens of millions or fractions. They also allow for the right level of in-game granularity; you can deal 25 damage instead of being forced to choose between the large gaps that exists between 2 or 3.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Round up/down smartly</span><br class="calibre1"/> Using multipliers on your data will often create numbers with lots of digits after the decimal point. On top of that, exponential growth in many game economies can easily turn your starting values in the hundreds into endgame values in the tens of millions. In these scenarios, you'll need to use clever rounding methods based on the factor of the number.</li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Spreadsheet formulas are an invaluable tool for any game designer! To achieve good rounding, you can try the following formula: = Floor(A1,10^(Floor(log10(A1))-1)))</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> It takes the value (A1) and rounds it down (Floor) to just two significant digits, creating a set of clean and readable numbers that maintain the right level of detail. This way, 5,421 becomes 5,400, and 1,437,938 turns into 1,400,000. If you'd like to show more significant digits, simply change the </span></span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">-1</span></span></span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> at the end into </span></span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">-2</span></span></span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> and so on. You can also use Ceiling instead of Floor to round values up.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Perception matters</span><br class="calibre1"/> Are you familiar with the <span class="italic">weak assault rifle</span> anecdote? A rumor has it that, in <span class="italic">Halo: Combat Evolved</span>, playtesters were avoiding the assault rifle like wildfire. They claimed it was too weak, even when the balancing was taken to the extreme, making it completely overpowered. Turns out, all the weapon needed was a louder sound effect with an increased amount of bass. Remember, balance is subjective! If players believe a tool is weak and avoid using it, it is weak, just not from the data point of view. If attempts to popularize a certain strategy with data alone fails, make sure to look for issues in perception. Perhaps all you need to do is work on the feedback including animation, camera, sounds, visual effects, and physical attributes.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Self-balancing strategies and countering</span><br class="calibre1"/> Rock-paper-scissors is a classic example of a self-balancing system; each choice is valid but comes with a clear strength and weakness. It's also a system built on hard-counters, that is, choices that guarantee success against a particular strategy. Most interesting power relationships are usually a bit more subtle, since they come down to a series of advantages and disadvantages, rather than absolutes. When designing the dynamics of different units and strategies, make sure that the power relationships make sense in the context of the game. The more grounded in reality and less ambiguous your strengths and weaknesses (trade-offs) are, the lower the learning curve.<br class="calibre1"/> For example, in a medieval strategy, the equivalent to the rock-paper-scissors (but with a less binary result) game would be the relationship between archers, pikemen, and cavalry. Archers are strong against pikemen, pikemen counter the cavalry, and cavalry can easily defeat the archers. Another highly popular power relationship is the one of opposing elements, as seen in <span class="italic">Pokémon</span>, which started simple with <span class="italic">fire</span> burning <span class="italic">grass</span>, <span class="italic">grass</span> absorbing <span class="italic">water,</span> and <span class="italic">water</span> putting out <span class="italic">fire</span>. Relationships of this kind can be a bit confusing though, especially if more ambiguous elements join the mix. Put the likes of <span class="italic">metal, life, death, light, ice, poison, darkness,</span> and <span class="italic">electricity</span> into the mix, and you’ll have a potential cluster of confusion on your hands. To make a system with such a high level of complexity work, you'll need to introduce it gradually, and ensure a good level of visibility that helps guide the players (in <span class="italic">Pokémon,</span> a clear efficacy report is given after each attack).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Feedback loops</span><br class="calibre1"/> Unbalanced systems often spiral out of control due to <span class="italic">feedback loops</span>. What are those? Let's start by examining a scenario from a fictional city management game.<br class="calibre1"/>
<span class="italic">Due to an unforeseen event, the population in your town shrinks, resulting in a decreased tax income. This, in turn, sabotages your budget and further lowers the satisfaction of your people, making them leave, reducing the tax income even further. Not long after, your town is desolate and out of funds to pick itself up.</span><br class="calibre1"/> This is an example of a <span class="italic">positive feedback loop</span>, where an event creates a ripple effect, which propelled its impact even further. Whenever the penalty for failure or reward for success is not carefully managed, there is a strong chance of having your game balance spiral out of control. Stay vigilant and investigate the systems you create by paying close attention to how player's power grows and shrinks with each outcome, and whether there's anything stopping them from raising or falling completely out of balance. A well-designed game is less of a nuclear reactor and more of a thermostat, keeping the temperature within a desired range.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Try Fermi estimation</span><br class="calibre1"/> Back in <a href="index_split_070.html#filepos210445"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 3</tt></span></a>, <span class="italic">Scoping a Game Project</span>, we introduced you to the estimation techniques attributed to Enrico Fermi. The same method can be utilized in game balancing. The initial values are almost always more or less educated guesses, and you can improve your results by considering the minimum and maximum acceptable values, then shooting straight for the average. Is five million the right amount of XP when going from level 49 to 50? I don’t know, but I do know that by framing this problem in an approachable way, we can better understand the implications of picking that number. Break it down!: <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">How much experience can a player on level 49 get in an hour?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">What if he's quite bad, and what if he's an expert?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">How many hours will people spend on the game a day?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">What's the minimum, and what's the maximum?</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Time for some divisions! Do these numbers look right?<br class="calibre1"/> Once you're happy with the time required for different types of players to level up, you've got yourself a great starting point!</li></ul></li><li value="5" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Unify your units</span><br class="calibre1"/> In complex economies with many resources at play, a shared frame of reference empowers you to make more natural comparisons and more informed balancing decisions. Don’t compare apples to oranges... just make sure everything is counted in carrots instead!<br class="calibre1"/> To start with, determine your unit! You can pick one of the resources that is already in the game, or you can use a completely imaginary one. I usually create a new one and call it <span class="bold">UU</span> for short. Next up, you have to set up a cost relationship matrix inside your balancing spreadsheets. This matrix states how much of the other resources goes towards one unified unit. For example, 1 UU equals 200 gold, 350 wood, 100 sulfur, and five minutes of playtime. The breakdown immediately settles that sulfur is twice as valuable as gold. The question is, is it twice as hard to obtain? And is that a conscious decision or an accident? A unified unit is highly effective at helping you assess and tune the <span class="italic">taps</span> (production) and <span class="italic">sinks</span> (spend) of multiple resources.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Quantities and relative power</span><br class="calibre1"/>Who'll win the fight between (A) one tank with 80 health and 50 damage and (B) two tanks with 50 health and 25 damage? The sum of the attributes favors (B), but the relative power does not. In this case, after (A) destroys one of the two tanks, it effectively lowers enemy damage potential by half, securing the margin it needs to win. This is a trivial example, but it goes to show that there’s more to balancing than raw attributes.The number of units in play can be either advantageous (the ability to move independently and attack two targets at once, enemy damage can be wasted due to <span class="italic">overkilling,</span> and so on) as well as disadvantageous (harder to maneuver or engage all enemies at once, requires more space or storage, easily countered by area of effect abilities). Always pay attention to how these factors affect your game!</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Use analytics</span><br class="calibre1"/> Parts of your game will be nearly impossible to balance without the help of analytics. Once the game is in the hands of playtesters, in beta or live, you should be able to gather data on the most and least popular choices and strategies, as well as win/loss ratios associated with them. More information on analytics awaits you in <a href="index_split_443.html#filepos1012825"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 15</tt></span></a><span class="italic">, Games As a Service</span>.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Lost opportunity is a cost</span><br class="calibre1"/> Saving money for a single big unit or item? The process of saving resources and withholding actions is part of the cost in itself. This cost varies depending on the game's mechanics and individual circumstances, but it may mean that you’re unable to scout ahead, capture ground, or defend against an incoming attack. Make sure that build times, limits, cooldowns, and building or research requirements are all taken into account, and treat them as part of the unit cost, allowing you to scale its power more accurately.</li><li value="9" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Make everything feel powerful</span><br class="calibre1"/> A common pitfall for many inexperienced designers is to put absolute trust in their spreadsheet formulas and move everything towards an uninspiring mediocrity. The most rewarding games are those in which most tools, gadgets, abilities, and weapons are not only fun to use, but when applied in the correct scenario, they feel absolutely overpowered. Above all, your game should be exciting, and it’s hard to pull that off if differences between strategies are minuscule, and the outcome of the balancing dull.</li><li value="10" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Minimize the iteration time</span><br class="calibre1"/> Having to rebuild the entire game just to see a few modified parameters in action is not only a huge waste of time but it also makes the balancing tasks much harder to pull off. After all, it's hard to follow your ideas through if you have to put your thought process on hold for minutes or hours at a time. Before production begins, make sure that the team knows your plans and intentions regarding game balancing. In an ideal world, basic tuning operations are done in the game editor or by using a debugged in-game interface and are immediately reflected in the game. Quick iteration times will help you enter the flow-state and apply your creativity in a more natural manner, with experimental edits that are in direct response to immediate observations.</li><li value="11" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Focus on the end-user</span><br class="calibre1"/> As you grow more and more adept at playing your own game (and solving your own puzzles), everything you create begins to feel easy and straightforward. The more experience you have with your game, the higher the risk of creating inaccessible content. Keep track of your target audience and determine who’s going to interact with the feature or content that you're tuning. When testing your work, you can try to put an artificial handicap on yourself, for example, by restricting yourself from using more than a few special abilities, or making purposefully sub-optimal decisions and seeing how the gameplay scenario evolves from there.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_801"/>


<div id="filepos908264" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">MBT balancing</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The MBT approach takes root in the old real-time strategy games like <span class="italic">Command and Conquer</span>, where the pillar unit of the army (usually the main battle tank, hence the MBT) is served as the centerpiece for unit balancing. It’s a simple but effective technique that can be applied to medium amounts of content (25-100 units).</p><p class="calibre_2">To start with, pick a well-rounded unit, the focal point of the content. In the case of a real-time strategy game such as <span class="italic">CC: Red Alert,</span> it would be the main battle tank—the backbone of most armies. Set the stats of your MBT, and tie everything else in the game right back to it. If your game features multiple factions, balancing the MBTs of each faction serves as a cross-faction anchor.</p><p class="calibre_2">Regardless of final in-game values, you want your initial MBT's stats to be as easy to read as possible: Speed 10, Health 100, Damage Per Second 10, Attack Speed 1, Range 10, Cost 100. The simple, round numbers make every other unit in the game instantly comparable to the common denominator.</p><p class="calibre_2">Once the base data for most units is plugged inside the spreadsheets, you can use simple formulas to calculate things such as:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Health per resource spent</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">DPS (damage per second) per resource spent</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Time to kill an MBT (derived from using attack speed and DPS)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Time to be killed by an MBT</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Once you're happy with the balance on paper, you can apply multiplications and be rounding to the data to make the numbers work (and look) good in-game.</p><p class="calibre_2">This technique can get you very far, very quickly, but its value goes down with the amount of complexity in play. Once you introduce elements such as special attacks, the area of effect abilities, different armor types, status resistances, and whole new categories such as flying or melee units, the MBT approach becomes much harder to pull off in an efficient and effective manner.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_803"/>


<div id="filepos910745" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Layered Modifiers</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The titular <span class="italic">Layered Modifiers</span> are as much of a balancing method as they are a way of structuring and thinking about your data. It is a powerful and highly scalable approach that can help you manage huge amounts of content and variables.</p><p class="calibre_2">Case in point, I have used this method in a mobile strategy game called <span class="italic">Transformers: Earth Wars</span> to establish and maintain balance with over 20,000 building and character variants. In terms of combat balancing alone, our data spreadsheets were in control of:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">9 defensive buildings (with up to 15 upgrade levels)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">13 utility and production buildings (with up to 15 upgrade levels)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">6 <span class="italic">Combiners</span> (super-units composed of 5-6 other robots; each <span class="italic">Combiner</span> had 2 upgrade versions and 10 to 20 power levels)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Over 120 <span class="italic">Transformers</span> characters, equally divided into two playable factions - <span class="italic">Autobots</span> and <span class="italic">Decepticons:</span>
<ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="italic">Autobot</span> and <span class="italic">Decepticon</span> characters were paired against one another. Some pairings were equal, and some were slightly asymmetric. Early on we pushed for variation, but after several months of live operations, we moved towards a near 100 percent equality within each pairing, mostly to maintain the community's sentiment on fairness.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Each character was given a <span class="italic">star rating</span> (from 1 to 5 stars). The higher the rating, the more rare and powerful the character. We usually released between 3 and 5 versions of each character.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">All characters had from 20 to 60 levels of experience (20 for 1-star, 40 for 2-star, 50 for 3-star, 60 for 4 and 5-star characters).</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Each character had a special ability with 10 upgrade levels (most abilities were unique within your faction, and were only shared with a bot's counterpart on the opposite side).</li></ul></li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Dozens of unique (and upgradable) pieces of equipment that change the stats and abilities of characters and defenses</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">A few dozens of <span class="italic">battle boosts</span> (single use power-ups)</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">So, how do you deal with over 20,000 moving parts? By starting from the very top and creating layers of modifiers that help differentiate, scale, and distinguish between your units.</p><p class="calibre_2">In <span class="italic">Transformers: Earth Wars</span>, we were able to master our data in <span class="italic">Google Sheets</span> and used an in-house plugin to import data from the sheets into files for use in-game. Let's break down the organization of character data and how various parts were multiplied and inherited at different levels. Note that a similar (but less complicated) approach was used for buildings, game economy, and other data-heavy aspects of the game.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_805"/>

This level of control enables live experimentation with game features and is invaluable when prototyping new gameplay.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_817"/>


<div id="filepos922550" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Game difficulty</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">It's up to the game and level designers to create an experience that's optimal for as many players as possible, and if that seems like a simple task, trust us when we say it's not!</p><p class="calibre_2">As we have already established in <a href="index_split_353.html#filepos796656"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 12</tt></span></a>, <span class="italic">Accessibility</span>, our audience varies greatly in their level of gaming experience, real-world knowledge, physical and mental capacity, and even language proficiency. From pattern recognition and memory to spatial navigation, reflexes, and hand-eye coordination, there are many skills at play, and in some departments, the gap between players can be huge. Moreover, some players like to be challenged, and others have little time and patience for a serious struggle, preferring to breeze through levels and experience the story with relative ease.</p><p class="calibre_2">There are many ways of addressing the difficulty gap. Some rely on pre-set attributes and redesigning the game content, while others are fully automatic and respond to player’s performance. No matter which solution you go for, it's important to remember that as the designer of the game, you're sure to know it inside out. By default, you'll make the game too difficult for the average player.</p><p class="calibre_2">It's paramount to playtest early, and playtest often, even if the sessions end up being quick, informal, and undocumented. Try to expose your work to players on both ends of the spectrum. Looking at how low-skilled and extremely proficient people react to new in-game challenges will help you assess what is and isn't difficult, and where the difficulty is coming from. Is it the number of variables at play, input frequency, accuracy or timing, or is it the game knowledge and mastery over game mechanics? After several sessions of this type, you'll gain insight into the main sources of difficulty in your game. You can use this knowledge in two ways:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">To develop a set of rules to adhere to</span>: For example, in an RTS on easy difficulty, we shouldn't have the AI attack the player in the first 6 minutes as they are unlikely to be ready.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">To help you score your encounters</span>: Try assigning artificial <span class="italic">difficulty points</span> and multipliers to various parts of your gameplay challenges. For example, a shielded enemy is 5, a shotgun troop is 3 (but 7 when fought up-close), having at least two enemies at once adds +20 percent to overall encounter difficulty, and so on. These calculations will be very rough at first, but you can make them more accurate by using them on fragments that are known to be easy or hard and adjusting the scoring criteria afterward. After a few days of iteration, you'll be able to measure how easy or hard each part of the game is, even before it's made!</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_819"/>


<div id="filepos925740" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Static difficulty settings</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Presenting a set of difficulty settings for players to choose from at the beginning of the game is one of the most common practices for tackling the initial skill gap. If possible, you should allow for this setting to be changed on-the-fly from within the options screen. This ensures that players are not entirely constrained by their initial choice, should they find themselves mismatched to the gameplay challenges at hand.</p><p class="calibre_2">Difficulty settings may seem like a trivial system at first, but determining what to change and how to change it without sacrificing playability is the hard part (pun intended). The most common and often the easiest approach is to create multipliers for basic game parameters such as time or move limit, player and enemy health, damage and accuracy, cost of equipment, and so on. This practice can often get you quite far, but it can also result in weird and immersion-breaking scenarios where, for example, enemies operate with spot-on accuracy and require a ridiculous amount of hits, while players themselves perish after a single shot in the foot.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">A hard difficulty setting should challenge all types of skills. Be careful of reducing your gameplay to a memory challenge, where players have to endure constant failure until they develop a bespoke solution to a particular encounter, only to fail repeatedly on the next one. By the same account, playing on an easy or casual setting should still involve making gameplay choices and require an understanding of basic game mechanics.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">By modifying attributes, costs, and rewards, you manipulate not only the game's difficulty but also player behavior. For example, by making things like health and ammo pick-ups extremely scarce, you are sure to encourage an overly slow and safe play. On the other hand, make these resources overly abundant and players will stop caring about them altogether and resort to the easiest, most powerful solution (no matter how boringly repetitive).</p><p class="calibre_2">A step up from simple multipliers is to modify the gameplay challenges themselves by:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Bespoke challenge variations</span>: Adding, removing, and swapping out enemies across the whole game can be a tedious task. If possible, strive for a system where you can <span class="italic">flag</span> different parts of in-game challenges (such as enemies or obstacles) and toggle them ON/OFF based on the flag. For example, out of 7 enemies that can spawn in an encounter, enemy #5 will only spawn on the <span class="italic">hard</span> setting, and enemy #3 will be swapped out for a weaker one when playing on <span class="italic">easy</span>. Be careful when making drastic changes, as you can accidentally break the performance (too many actors on the screen), or create an encounter that's so short it feels redundant or so long it gets tedious.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Modifying starting states</span>: This involves changing player's initial units/equipment/abilities/tools and so on, as well as modifying the default state of the world. Now, changing the entire map layout may seem a bit extreme, but making certain traps or pick-ups appear/disappear depending on the difficulty setting is not unfeasible!</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Changing the winning and losing conditions</span>: Setting different score requirements, turn and time limits, or adding/removing requirements altogether is usually easy to pull off but requires individual tuning and additional playtesting.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Needless to say, difficulty-specific content variations can add a lot of workload across the whole project, which is why it often pays off to invest time in modifying your game systems and mechanics instead. Let's take a look at a few examples!:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Moving the information horizon</span>: Information is power! You can affect a player's decision-making capabilities by changing the rules around the <span class="italic">fog of war</span> or by unveiling/obscuring information about enemy strength, position, strategy, and weaknesses.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Toggling player assisting features</span>: Depending on the difficulty setting, you can vary the amount of gameplay assistance offered to players. This includes anything from enabling or disabling hints and aim to assist, to toggling various elements of the user interface such as the mini-map, objective and enemy markers, target reticle, and so on.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Adapting major game systems</span>: Gameplay stretches far beyond the scope of your level design and mechanics. Any optional rules and restrictions can be toggled based on the difficulty. For example, in a puzzle game, the time limit could be turned off on <span class="italic">easy</span>, while the move undo feature is unavailable on <span class="italic">hard</span>. Moreover, you can make your in-game challenges more thrilling (but also potentially frustrating) by limiting the quantity of <span class="italic">game saves</span> or restricting them to a particular place or point in time (be it outside of combat, or in a special shrine). That said, changes to the base rules and systems can be controversial and leave an undesirable impact on some of your mechanics and the structure of the average game session. Apply them with great care.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Modifying the Artificial Intelligence</span>: Look for parts of enemy behavior that can be tweaked across difficulty settings without making the enemies seem either totally incompetent or godlike. For example, modify the likelihood of flanking or aggressive pursuit behaviors, or the chances of using special moves and throwing grenades. Another good trick is to provide the enemies with low initial accuracy, that is, the first few shots are unlikely to hit (and perhaps they even deal lowered damage), giving players more time to react while still feeling threatened.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Changing the consequences of failure</span>: Lowering or increasing the consequences of failure will dramatically change the feel of the game. To increase the tension and make your gameplay more impactful, you can experiment with the loss of progress (experience, items, resources, and so on) or even more extreme features such as permanent death—a defining feature of modern <span class="italic">rogue-like</span> games like <span class="italic">Faster Than Light</span> or <span class="italic">Rogue Legacy</span>. Negative consequences are not for everyone though, so be very careful as to how and when you apply them. You're at a real risk of infuriating your players and throwing them into a feedback loop fueled by failure, where each death makes them weaker and even more likely to fail again. Consider serving these features on an opt-in basis. In <span class="italic">XCOM2</span>, players can toggle the <span class="italic">Ironman mode</span> when starting a new game. On <span class="italic">Ironman</span>, players are restricted to a single save file, which gets overwritten on each turn, making every action and decision irreversible (and by extension, much more thrilling).</li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Remember, making any changes to game difficulty will cause the ripple on effects in the game's balance (by promoting or diminishing the effectiveness of certain strategies) and the pacing of the experience (by encouraging more reckless or careful play). Do not venture into extremes; try mixing several solutions and observe their effects.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_821"/>


<div id="filepos933756" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Embracing mono-difficulty</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Multiple difficulty settings are a long-accepted practice among players and the industry, but not every game requires them. Even if you normalize your game towards the average player, you can still cater to the far ends of the skill spectrum.</p><p class="calibre_2">A great way to maintain a single difficulty mode, yet prevent players from getting stuck, is to offer help once they meet a certain condition. For example, being stuck on a puzzle for 15 minutes triggers a hint, or failing to complete the stage five times in a row gives you a power-up.</p><p class="calibre_2">Successful (and very explicit) examples of such systems can be found in many <span class="italic">Nintendo</span> products. <span class="italic">Super Mario 3D World</span> gives you access to a powerful power-up after several deaths, while <span class="italic">New Super Mario Bros. U</span> – features a <span class="italic">Super Guide Block</span>—an auto-play mode that can complete the troubling area (or even the entire stage) for the player. These systems are opt-in (players can ignore the help offering) and often have some kind of consequence such as a reduced score.</p><p class="calibre_2">On the other hand, to cater to the highly skilled players, you’ll need to create ample ways for them to show off and receive recognition. The most popular features include optional objectives (in <span class="italic">Super Mario 3D World</span>, that would be collecting all of the special coins) and difficult side missions, optional bosses, high-score tables, maliciously hidden secrets, accolades, and achievements. Reaching the end of a game may be relatively easy, but mastering it - completing all challenges and unlocking an alternative ending - should be a far harder endeavor!</p><p class="calibre_2">Mono-difficulty is a great option for story-driven experiences and puzzle or adventure games. Puzzle challenges are not only difficult to grade accurately (what's hard for me may be trivially easy for you), but also pose a challenge to the creation of more discrete difficulty settings - how can you scale your puzzles without giving away the solution? A fixed difficulty setting is also a suitable choice for products with innovative mechanics that do not rely on physical prowess or strong gaming experience—we all start in a similar spot. Budget and time constraints are also valid, though far less glamorous reasons.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_823"/>


<div id="filepos936361" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Automatic difficulty adjustment</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Regardless of whether your game has one or six difficulty settings, there are ways in which you can cleverly adapt individual challenges to a player's current progress or performance.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_825"/>


<div id="filepos936761" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Rubberbanding</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Rubberbanding</span> systems are designed to keep contestants close together, to wrap an imaginary rubber band around them. They try to maintain an optimal level of challenge for each player by creating a <span class="italic">negative feedback loop</span> and adjusting in-game variables in real time. You can view <span class="italic">rubberbanding</span> as a systematic equivalent of <span class="italic">Robin Hood;</span> it helps those who struggle while providing an extra challenge to those who dominate. It can be done with players being well aware of the process or in total secret.</p><p class="calibre_2">Most racing games do their best to cover their tracks and create an illusion of a tight and fair race. In <span class="italic">Burnout,</span>
<span class="italic">Need for Speed</span> and countless other games, an invisible rubber band controls the speed of NPC drivers, linking their performance to a player's position. Get ahead and the rivals will soon follow to contest your position, fall behind and the whole pack of AI drivers will slow down to let you catch up and get within a fighting range.</p><p class="calibre_2">On the other hand, item box mechanics in <span class="italic">Nintendo's Mario Kart</span> serve as a good example of <span class="italic">rubberbanding</span> that's almost explicit. The game features boxes that can be picked up during the race, and each box gives out a seemingly random item from a selection of several weapons and power-ups. However, players are quick to realize that participants at the front of the pack receive far inferior items than those at the end. The gap in item quality between positions 1 and 8 is huge, and the game never tries to obscure it—some items are simply unavailable to well-performing drivers.</p><p class="calibre_2">The item box modifiers in <span class="italic">Mario Kart</span> serve as proof that the use of <span class="italic">rubberbanding</span> reaches far beyond the racing genre. Bonuses and penalties based on a player's standing (be it against the NPCs as well as other players) can be introduced to almost any game system.</p><p class="calibre_2">Once you determine what to adjust, you'll also need to decide whether to be explicit about it or keep it a secret. As a rule of thumb, any game that tries to maintain a level of credibility and fairness in its competitive play should be crystal clear about the benefits and pitfalls of holding a certain place. In case of single player games, the options are wider and you may employ any tricks you wish. However, bear in mind that enforcing <span class="italic">optimal</span> difficulty across the board can make for a poorly paced and highly predictable game (we'll speak more about pacing later in this chapter).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_827"/>

This is easier said than done, but there are several criteria you can consider when pitting players against one another:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Inexperience</span>: You may want to safeguard newcomers and have them play against one another until they reach a certain stage. Avoid applying it to the entire population.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Progression</span>: If players get more powerful over time (for example, by gaining experience levels or building up their kingdom), you might want to calculate their power and use it to match between players who are not too far apart.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Past performance</span>: This is often done by introducing an Elo rating system, which gives each player a skill rating. This rating can be shown directly as is, translated into a title/medal/league of some sort, or kept invisible (to prevent players from trying to <span class="italic">game</span> the system and lower their ratings in anticipation of big events). Regardless, after each game, rating points are attributed to the winner and are detracted from the loser depending on their standings. In an uneven match, the higher rated player has more to lose and less to gain and vice-versa.</li></ol><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Current performance</span>: In some scenarios, the easiest approach might be to match players based on their most recent standing or a winning streak. For example, let's say that the players are to play a total of 10 games; all you need is to match people with similar win rates together. This will make it harder and harder to go on undefeated while giving the players who are below average an increasing chance to win over time. This works best when players start at a similar entry point.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Self-determined matchmaking</span>: You can also try to offload the burden of matchmaking by letting the players pick their own opponent. Put your players into several categories based on their skill or power, and then let them choose what kind of opponent they wish to fight. Make sure to incentivize punching above your weight while providing an insignificant reward for smashing someone far weaker.</li></ol><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_829"/>


<div id="filepos942192" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Progression-driven difficulty</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Certain games aspire to offer both extensive character progression systems and vast worlds with seemingly unrestricted exploration. This offering creates a balancing risk where players are likely to run into a whole array of encounters, from trivial to impossibly difficult.</p><p class="calibre_2">To counter this risk, game developers often create systems that automatically adjust game difficulty based on a particular indicator, such as the critical vector of progression (which we introduced as a concept in <a href="index_split_070.html#filepos210445"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 3</tt></span></a>, <span class="italic">Scoping a Game Project</span>). This could be a player’s experience level, the state of the main storyline, or even the elapsed time since the game began.</p><p class="calibre_2">The aforementioned difficulty changes often focus on scaling the power of encountered enemies or even replacing them with entirely different ones. Some rewards are also adjusted to remain meaningful, which means that with the very same enemy, the quest or <span class="italic">loot chest</span> will offer more impressive rewards once your character has progressed. Difficulty scaling does not have to be linear; the average encounter may get progressively more difficult as players grow more accustomed to the game and master its mechanics.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Progression-driven difficulty scaling does not address the differences in skill and capabilities between different players.

Our ultimate goal is to utterly captivate our audience, to suspend their disbelief, and keep them in the state of <span class="italic">flow</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">The psychological concept of <span class="italic">flow</span> or the <span class="italic">zone</span> has been recognized and named by <span class="italic">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</span> in 1975, and refers to the mental state of being fully immersed in the task at hand, even to the point of losing the sense of time and space:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00139.jpg" class="calibre_96"/></p><p class="calibre_2">The basic flow graph represents the relationship between difficulty and skill. As players grow more experienced and competent, they require more challenging tasks.</p><p class="calibre_2">However, there's more to pacing than matching a player's skill and task difficulty! As you may remember, back in the midst of the chapter on level design, we mentioned that the pace of the game is often dictated by the intensity of the levels you create. The aforementioned intensity stems not only from task difficulty but also from mental and sensory stimulation. By this standard, game designers, level designers, writers, and artists are all responsible for invoking and maintaining the flow state in their own regard.</p><p class="calibre_2">If you were to look at your game as if it was a dish or a musical composition, every bit of content and functionality you have would become an ingredient or an instrument; they all play an important part in something bigger. Exciting plot twists and a whole new planet to explore both stimulate your audience and raise your overall intensity without affecting game difficulty at all.</p><p class="calibre_2">As a rule of thumb, novel content and difficult sections raise your intensity while repetitive segments and low difficulty lower it. Prolonged periods of low intensity lead to boredom, while long, overly intense sections can exhaust your players. However, this is just scratching the surface. Before we understand how to set and control the pace, let's unpack the meaning of mental and sensory stimulation in the context of games.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_833"/>

For example, most humans find great joy in exploring uncharted lands, experimenting with new tools, and diving deep into captivating stories. These types of experiences are unarguably useful in making our games more immersive and engaging, and thus should be paced accordingly.</p><p class="calibre_2">To begin with, any part of the game that encourages thinking and decision-making can be considered as cognitively and mentally stimulating. Actions that stimulate our players include (but are not limited to):</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Learning and mastering gameplay mechanics and controls</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Analyzing new and unfamiliar content, building world knowledge</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Predicting consequences of story developments and reminiscing about past events</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Making meaningful decisions</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Calculating risks and rewards, planning your moves</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Sensory stimulation, on the other hand, is all about the visceral experience of inhabiting, observing, and listening to the game world, as well as interacting with it outside the context of game challenges. Sensory stimulation stems from:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">The theme and mood of the game</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Visuals such as 2D and 3D art, animation, visual effects, environments, graphical user interface</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">UI interactions</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Background actors and NPCs (animals or people going about their day)</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">World interaction and physics (some of us spent hours using the <span class="italic">Gravity Gun</span> to throw bathroom sinks in <span class="italic">Half-Life 2</span>)</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Audio music, sound effects, voice-overs, ambient noises</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">Passive (non-interactive) storytelling via text, cutscenes, and audio</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">The preceding mentioned sources of mental and sensory stimulation are often heavily intertwined and impossible to break down without extensive research, but attempting to list them may help us appreciate the roles of various parts of the game in pacing.</p><p class="calibre_2">To effectively use mental and sensory stimulation in this context, you need to be aware of the inherent diminishing returns. Repeated exposure to any element (be it a type of puzzle, musical piece, animation, or background) reduces its impact and effectiveness. Overly familiar elements get parsed by our brains as a simple background. Just like strangers on the bus, they are rarely memorable or worthy of prolonged attention. There is comfort in familiarity, but too much of it leads to the feelings of stagnation. Every game world needs background noise, but it's up to you to make sure that there is enough going on to maintain a player's interest.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Remember, adding more content and mechanics is not a sure-fire way of making your game more engaging. To start with, piling up more elements will make quality assurance, playtesting, and any gameplay iterations much more expensive. Even then, your attempts at enriching the experience can backfire. The same elements used to inspire the feelings of awe, anticipation, curiosity, and artistic satisfaction can end up overwhelming the player. The story can get diluted by unnecessary plot points and the entire game can get too big to manage, too difficult to balance, and too long to play through. Prepare a content lifespan document, set your pacing early on, and only keep what works!</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_835"/>


<div id="filepos954240" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">How to approach pacing</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Challenging and stimulating experiences are powerful weapons against boredom, but using them to their best effect is a difficult art. Even in a game with a set, unchanging difficulty setting, the intensity of moment to moment gameplay is rarely constant.</p><p class="calibre_2">Instead, we ought to steadily escalate the physical and mental difficulty but also remember to give players a moment to catch their breath, plan their next moves, invest resources, and start anticipating <span class="italic">the next big thing</span>. Moments of lower intensity do not need to be empty; they can be populated by scripted events, storytelling, socializing, and sensory stimulation.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Contrast applies to pacing as much as it applies to art. If everything explodes, nothing really does. A game that's all-out intense has no highlights, no ups, and no downs. Flatly paced gameplay and storytelling make up for a series of experiences that easily clump together into an indistinguishable mash.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">To put things into a more practical perspective, we'll explore the methods used to pace linear content, follow them with more systemic solutions, and close off with some loose tips!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_837"/>


<div id="filepos955784" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Pacing linear content</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Linear game content is driven by the combined efforts of level design and the narrative, making it expensive and time-consuming to iterate on, but giving you the ability to control gameplay on a very granular, moment-by-moment basis. One of the best ways of exercising this control is to work with a timeline.</p><p class="calibre_2">This timeline is a long graph spanning the entire length of a single, self-contained fragment of the game that we're about to pace. Gradually, your timeline will be populated with more and more precise details, creating a solid action plan and reducing iteration times dramatically. It's best to start this process early on, during the outline or blockout period, when there's still a potentially high degree of flexibility in terms of gameplay, story, intensity, and structure.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Even though we're working on a single area or level, the pace and progression of the entire game have to be taken into consideration. Make note of what happens before and after your stage, and how your plan fits the overall structure of the game.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Since it's much easier to work on a trusted and effective storytelling structure, try dividing your timeline (and thus, your stage) into three or four distinct acts:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Introduction</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Escalation</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">The Twist (optional)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Conclusion</li></ol><p class="calibre_2">These acts will help you govern the overall flow of intensity in the level and help you provide a sense of progression and closure. They are also a useful scaffolding for framing the narrative. Let's take a look at a fictional example:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00121.jpg" class="calibre_97"/></p><p class="calibre_2">Now, use the content lifespan, the script, level sketch, or any other design document to make a list of any elements that you absolutely must have on your level. This includes things like plot twists, puzzle ideas, new content, and mechanics you plan to introduce and so on.</p><p class="calibre_2">Place these elements on the timeline, and pinpoint the desired intensity and its trend at that point in time:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00084.jpg" class="calibre_98"/></p><p class="calibre_2">This is a good starting point, but our acts consist of more than a few key points! We can divide them further into areas or <span class="italic">chunks</span> of various types, such as:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Gameplay chunks may include various types, for example: <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Combat</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Puzzle-solving</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Platforming</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Exploration</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Stealth</li></ul></li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Narrative chunks for important story elements, cutscenes, dialogue sections, and so on</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Tutorials and scripted events</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Populate the graph with various chunks and try to maintain a level of variety within gameplay tasks and their intensity. Keep refining the curve as you go along! Even though the intensity may seem ambiguous at first, it will provide a meaningful target to hit during gray boxing and implementation phases and enforce a degree of self-control:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00165.jpg" class="calibre_99"/></p><p class="calibre_2">With a complete timeline on hand, you can plan your work more effectively, build up to big events, vary the tasks, and deliver an emotional impact. Do not rush your timelines; a solid plan can help you save lots of time later on!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_839"/>


<div id="filepos960309" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Pacing via rules and mechanics</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">By adding and modifying the rules and mechanics, you can evolve your gameplay scenarios, setting the pace and intensity in a highly efficient and repeatable way. Let's look at some examples of using game system pacing:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Time</span><br class="calibre1"/>Time limits are often used to raise the pace and keep players on the task at hand. Even if things start slow and calculated, the action is sure to pick up as any indecision and inaction slowly accumulate towards an incredibly tense finale. Furthermore, by using mechanics such as overtime (where the game does not end for as long as a losing team is contesting the objective), you can make the game more exciting and give the underdogs a chance to come back from their previous mistakes.<br class="calibre1"/> On a different note, the games in the <span class="italic">Warrioware</span> series are an extreme example of using time in pacing. Players are presented with a series of quick and silly micro-games, simple tasks that test your reaction time and ask for a few precise inputs. Things start slow, but after a series of several micro-games, the game speeds up and raises the difficulty by reducing the time limits for all tasks.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Score</span><br class="calibre1"/> Getting close to beating a high score is sure to raise the stakes, but the use of scoring systems extends beyond rankings or the leaderboard, and has great effects on pacing in scenarios involving direct competition. For example, in <span class="italic">Rainbow Six: Siege</span>, as in many <span class="italic">eSports</span> games, two teams compete in games that are divided into multiple, individually scored rounds. As the opposing team starts winning points, the intensity naturally grows higher for the losing team. For the leading side, on the other hand, the effect is the opposite. If you need 5 points to win, dropping from 4-0 to 4-1 is still a low-intensity scenario (after all, you have plenty of room for error). As always, the key to sustaining an engaging pacing across both teams is to provide the means for the losing side to come back, and by extension, keep the winning team on their toes.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Resource escalation</span><br class="calibre1"/>Taking control over resource generation is one of the most effective ways a game designer can raise or lower the intensity of any gameplay scenario. In this context, the resources (minerals, coins, fuel, mana, and so on) are anything that players can use to introduce new elements and options to the game (units, moves, combinations, special abilities, and so on). Resource escalation can be done linearly, exponentially, or in distinct stages. For example, in <span class="italic">Hearthstone</span> and <span class="italic">Magic the Gathering</span>, the possibilities for combos and the potential impact of each card grows steadily with the rise <span class="italic">mana</span>. <span class="italic">Clash Royale</span>, on the other hand, has 3-minute-long matches, where resource production is kept still for the first 2 minutes. After that, the game goes into overdrive and doubles the resource generation, and thus multiplies the speed and intensity of the gameplay. This practice also increases the chances of resolving the match in 3 minutes without triggering overtime.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Pacing in MOBA games</span><br class="calibre1"/>Games in the MOBA genre like <span class="italic">League of Legends</span> or <span class="italic">DOTA 2</span> are great examples of using rules and systems to manipulate pacing. It pays off to investigate these games, even if you are not a fan. In both cases, the game starts slow, with players largely sticking to their area of the map and methodically accumulating resources and unlocking new abilities. As players grow in power, their options increase and so does the intensity. After several minutes, players are more able to withstand enemy defenses and secure kills. This shifts the dynamic and encourages players to group up, enforcing intense team fights.<br class="calibre1"/> However, the higher your character level, the longer you need to wait to respawn. This may provide a nice break from an increasingly stressful game, but it also increases the consequences of failure. Near the end of a match, the intensity spikes from each encounter can become enormous, especially since both teams are constantly damaging each other's defenses and coming ever closer to securing a victory.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_841"/>


<div id="filepos964884" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Pacing tips</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Now that we have an understanding of what pacing is and how to approach it, let's look at some more concrete examples and tips, starting with the role of actor removal.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_843"/>


<div id="filepos965249" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Investigating actor removal</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Strategy games have a natural pace based on the slow accumulation of power and the results of exercising it. In many cases, the intensity grows as you amass the army, peaks when you go into battle, and either raise through a lost encounter (as you scramble to recover and are left feeling exposed) or lowers with a win (as the threat is reduced).</p><p class="calibre_2">Moreover, the higher the number of cards, units, or resources under a player's disposal, the more actions and choices they have to make or at least consider. Having little to do is far more relaxing than having to analyze hundreds of combinations and spread the attention across multiple actors and possible locations.</p><p class="calibre_2">In team-based games, player elimination is sure to put more pressure on the remaining players, especially if there's still a remote chance of winning. In fact, increasing the chance to recover from a losing scenario is a great way of making the game more fun for both sides.</p><p class="calibre_2">These are just a few simple examples, but hopefully, you'll look at actor removal and player elimination in your games. Analyze the effects they have on pacing, and look for improvements that can be made to address or increase these effects.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_845"/>


<div id="filepos966776" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">High-intensity and storytelling</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">As things start to blow up and the tempo picks up, the plot might need to take a backseat. Most Hollywood action movies deliberately pause major plot developments for the duration of intense action sequences (car chases, fights, shootouts, and so on). These scenes can be great for light characterization, but suffer when trying to express complex motives, deep emotions, and intertwined storylines. The viewer will be too distracted by everything that’s going on to pay attention to more intricate and subtle aspects of the narrative.</p><p class="calibre_2">Consider applying the same principle to your game and avoid putting heavily involved story elements in very intense sections of your game.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_847"/>


<div id="filepos967713" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Multiplayer pacing and level design</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The layout of your maps is a great tool to modify pacing. You may remember from the level design chapter that providing effective cover will encourage more careful and static play, while rich flanking opportunities and pick-ups will promote movement. However, to further control your pacing, you must look at how gameplay evolves over time.</p><p class="calibre_2">As an example, in the <span class="italic">Battlefield</span> series<span class="italic">,</span> the <span class="italic">Rush</span> game mode has one team defending two objectives (radio transmitters or similar) from the attackers who try to successfully detonate them before running out of time or respawns. Upon the successful destruction of both objectives, a new set becomes available and the entire action shifts to a new part of the map. There may be up to 5 different sets of fresh targets, and each set may offer new gameplay opportunities, vehicles, and strategies. In <span class="italic">Rush</span>, the evolving map layout is constantly shifting the pace.</p><p class="calibre_2">The map layouts in an RTS like <span class="italic">Starcraft 2</span> are equally as important. For instance, you can increase or lower the pace of the match entirely by modifying the number of resources available in the starting location, thus changing resource production rates and encouraging or discouraging early expansion efforts. Increasing map size and surrounding players with destructible obstacles or water would further modify the tempo, but at the cost of possibly invalidating certain strategies—ones we worked so hard to enable with careful game balancing.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_849"/>


<div id="filepos969504" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Utilizing threat and anxiety</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">In games that revolve around challenge and skill, threat and anxiety play a dominant role in setting the intensity, a role that's often mismanaged or misunderstood. The threat itself does not depend entirely on the actual difficulty of the gameplay scenario. Instead, it is based on the perception of adversity and fueled by the negative consequences of failure.</p><p class="calibre_2">If the stakes are high, a relatively trivial gameplay encounter can be a source of an immense level of threat. For example, when players die in <span class="italic">Dark Souls</span> (and other games in the <span class="italic">Souls series</span>), they drop any <span class="italic">Souls</span> they've amassed but not spent. <span class="italic">Souls</span> are a crucial resource that relates to a character's overall progression. If players fail to collect the dropped souls within their next life, the souls disappear forever, and with them, potentially hours of character and world progress.</p><p class="calibre_2">By raising the stakes and tapping into the <span class="italic">loss aversion bias</span> (it's in our nature to absolutely hate losing or missing out on things) this mechanic can turn even the most trivial and previously mastered part of the stage into an immensely stressful endeavor. However, there is a positive flipside to this inarguably extreme mechanic. The high game difficulty and consequences of repeated failure are not only raising the intensity and reinvigorating completed content; the successful collection of dropped <span class="italic">Souls</span> is accompanied by a great sense of satisfaction, pride, and relief. Moreover, even if you were to fail twice in a row, the souls may be gone forever but so is the pressure and tension built around trying to reclaim them. For an average <span class="italic">Dark Souls</span> player, repeated death is as frustrating as it is motivating:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00158.jpg" class="calibre_100"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Against all odds, the </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Dark Souls</span></span><span class="calibre4"> series has popularised the emotional rollercoaster of high-stakes gameplay in the west</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Dark Souls</span> aside, an intense game does not need to be a severely punishing one. In <span class="italic">BioShock</span>, difficult battles often end up with <span class="italic">close calls</span> and <span class="italic">hard-fought victories.</span> This is no accident. According to the developers, the game is designed to tip the scale in the player’s favor in times of great need. When the player is about to die, the game instead leaves them with a small percentage of health and turns them invulnerable for a short period of time. This gives the player a chance to shoot back and finish the fight with just a tiny portion of their health left. It sure feels great to repeatedly escape death by a razor-thin margin!</p><p class="calibre_2">There are many more examples of such trickery in the world of game development. Just because we expect our players to play fair, doesn't mean we can't cheat a little to ensure they are having a good time. If done right, these tricks will remain invisible to the players and keep them inside the <span class="italic">flow channel</span>, but if done badly, they will backfire and break the immersion we worked so hard to build.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">A game with no failure states and no punishment is one that poses no direct threat to the player, and some can argue that it is not even a real game, but an interactive experience. In such scenarios, it's very difficult to maintain a player’s interest by directly challenging their abilities. Instead, the game has to rely on other emotions and control pacing by rewarding progress, aspirational goals (difficult puzzles and challenges), as well as mental and sensory stimulation (new mechanics, inspiring art, a captivating story, and so on). Note that having to replay even the smallest part of the game is a form of punishment—repeating tasks without making progress in the game is rarely fun.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">The screenshots used in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only.
