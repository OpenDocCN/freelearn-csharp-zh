   <p>
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Blazor
     
    </strong>
    
     is a powerful web framework introduced by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive and modern web applications using
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      C#
     
    </strong>
    
     and
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      .NET
     
    </strong>
    
     instead of relying on JavaScript.
    
    
     Blazor bridges the gap between front-end and back-end development, offering a unified programming model that makes it easier to create full-featured web applications with a consistent and robust language stack.
    
    
     With Blazor, you can choose to host your application statically on the server; have a server-side interactivity through
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      SignalR
     
    </strong>
    
     ; build a client-side interface running directly in the browser, using
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      WebAssembly
     
    </strong>
    
     ; or mix all approaches however you
    
    
     
      see fit.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     While you can easily find resources introducing Blazor basics and fundamental concepts, this book takes you deeper into advanced techniques and best practices for building enterprise-grade Blazor applications.
    
    
     The goal is to equip you with the tools to build robust, secure, scalable, and maintainable solutions.
    
    
     We will focus on practical, real-world examples and walk through the recipes you need to tackle the most common development challenges, leveraging the powerful features that
    
    
     
      Blazor offers.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The solutions and tricks in this cookbook come from or are inspired by two
    
    
     
      primary sources:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     
      my years of experience developing Blazor applications across various industries, countries, and domains
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Blazor community and insights from leading Blazor developers and experts
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     As Blazor continues to evolve, it is increasingly recognized as a game-changer in the .NET ecosystem, especially with the growing trend of full-stack C# development.
    
    
     As more companies adopt Blazor for their web development needs, the demand for skilled Blazor developers is rapidly increasing.
    
    
     This book will not only help you stay ahead of the curve but also ensure that you can confidently build and maintain Blazor applications that meet modern
    
    
     
      web standards.

     To get the most out of this book
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     You will need to have an understanding of the basics of Blazor, as well as fundamentals of web development.
    
    
     On top of that, you’re required to have an IDE that supports .NET and Blazor development as well as a browser that supports WebAssembly and modern CSS and HTML (which all modern web browsers do).
    
    
     You also need to have a .NET 9 SDK and runtime installed on
    
    
     
      your machine.
