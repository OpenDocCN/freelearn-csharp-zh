- en: Along with Windows 1.0, in the year 1985, Microsoft introduced Graphics Device
    Interface (GDI) and the USER subsystem in order to build a Windows-based Graphical
    User Interface (GUI). In 1990, OpenGL came into picture to create 2D and 3D graphics
    on Windows and non-Windows systems. In 1995, Microsoft presented another technology,
    called DirectX, to create high-performance 2D/3D graphics. Later, GDI+ was introduced
    to add alpha blending and gradient brush support on top of the existing GDI.

- en: In 2002, Microsoft introduced .NET Framework. Along with this, Windows Forms
    was also introduced to build User Interface (UI) for Windows using C# and Visual
    Basic languages. It was built on top of GDI+, and hence, it still had the limitations
    of the GDI+ and USER subsystems.

- en: Over the years, Microsoft decided to bring a new technology to build rich UIs
    for Windows-based applications, which not only helped the users (developers and
    designers) to escape the limitations of GDI/GDI+ and USER subsystems, but also
    helped them to improve their productivity when building desktop-based applications.

- en: In November 2006, along with .NET 3.0, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
    was introduced to provide the developers a unified programming model to build
    dynamic, data-driven desktop applications for Windows. It came with a broad set
    of features to create a graphical subsystem to render rich UIs using various controls,
    layouts, graphics, resources, and more, considering the application and the security
    of the data. As it was first shipped as part of the .NET Framework 3.0, the first
    release was called WPF 3.0.

- en: WPF is a resolution-independent framework that uses a vector-based rendering
    engine using an XML-based language called XAML (pronounced Zammel), to create
    modern user experiences that provided a declarative model for application programming.
    Using this, you can easily customize the controls and add skins to it to get a
    better representation of the application's UI.

- en: As WPF was different than classic Windows Forms, as it uses XAML, data binding,
    templates, styles, animations, documents, and more, initially it got little attention.
    However, later, it started gaining a lot of popularity and attraction. Many updated
    versions were released to add more functionality to it to make it robust and powerful.

- en: In this book, we will cover a set of recipes that will show you how to perform
    common tasks using WPF. Starting with WPF fundamentals, we will cover standard
    controls, layouts, panels, data bindings, custom controls, user controls, styles,
    templates, triggers, and animations and later move on to the uses of resources,
    MVVM patterns, WCF services, debugging, threading, and WPF interoperabilities,
    to make sure you understand the foundation properly.

- en: The examples given in this book are simple, easy to understand, and provide
    you with a what you need to learn and master the skills that you need to build
    desktop applications using WPF. By the time you reach the end of this book, you
    will be proficient enough with deep knowledge about each of the chapters that
    it covers. Although this book has covered most of the important topics, there
    will always be some topics that no books can completely cover. You will definitely
    enjoy reading this book, as there are lots of graphical and textual steps to help
    you gain confidence working with Windows Presentation Foundation.

    focuses on WPF''s architecture, application types, and XAML syntax, terminologies,
    and explains how to install WPF Workload with Visual Studio 2017 to create your
    first application targeting Windows Presentation Foundation. It will cover the
    navigation mechanisms, various dialog boxes, building ownership between multiple
    windows, and then proceed toward creating a single instance application. This
    chapter will then cover how to pass arguments to WPF application and how to handle
    unhandled exceptions thrown in WPF.'

    common control parts of WPF. This chapter will begin with TextBlock, Label, TextBox,
    and Image controls, and then continue with 2D shapes, Tooltip, standard menu,
    Context Menu, Radio buttons, and CheckBox controls. This chapter will also cover
    how to work with Progress Bar, Slider, Calendar, ListBox, ComboBox, StatusBar,
