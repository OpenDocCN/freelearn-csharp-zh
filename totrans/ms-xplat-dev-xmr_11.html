Source control options, as well as automated build strategies, will be demonstrated for Xamarin projects. Additional topics such as live telemetry collection and beta application distribution hubs will also be covered. This chapter is divided into the following sections:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Source control</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Continuous integration</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Automated testing</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Beta deployment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Live telemetry</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec64"/>Source control</h1></div></div></div><p>Regardless <a class="indexterm" id="id644"/>of working as a team or as an individual, source control or version control remains a fundamental element of a software project development pipeline. Source code repository is the term used to describe the code management storage that deals with the versioning and consolidation of the code base. Additional features of source code repositories may include, but are not limited to, branching, reviews, shelves, and similar productivity-related capabilities. However, these items apply to any type of software development project and are out of the scope of this book.</p><p>For Xamarin projects, developers can utilize several types of repositories. The selection of a repository generally depends on the environment setup of choice (that is, operating system, development IDE, and so on).</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec129"/>TFVC</h2></div></div></div><p><strong>Team Foundation Version Control</strong> (<strong>TFVC</strong>) is the name given to the <a class="indexterm" id="id645"/>native repository provided by Team Foundation Server <a class="indexterm" id="id646"/>and its cloud-based counterpart Visual Studio Team Services (formerly, Visual Studio Online). TFVC is a centralized version control system where the version history is kept in a centralized server repository and the clients have only one version (that is, the workspace version) of each file.</p><p>TFVC provides a very familiar source code management toolset for Xamarin developers accustomed to the Microsoft development stack. For Xamarin developers using Windows and Visual Studio, TFVC is an ideal choice since it has native integration to Visual Studio. Source code management is implemented on the premise of "check-in" and "check-out" actions. Each code check-in can additionally include references to project metadata artifacts such as tasks, features, and bugs. Associating change sets (that is, a bundle of source code files to be checked-in) and project metadata provides an ideal development pipeline for developers working in a team.</p><p>For developers using Xamarin Studio on Windows or Mac OS, the only available option to use TFVC is to install Team Explorer Everywhere. Team Explorer Everywhere is an Eclipse plugin, which can be installed on Mac OS and employed to check in and check out source code items. Developers using Xamarin Studio on Windows can still install and use the free editions of Visual Studio to access TFS servers.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec130"/>Git</h2></div></div></div><p><strong>Git</strong>, unlike <a class="indexterm" id="id647"/>TFVC, is a <a class="indexterm" id="id648"/>distributed version control system where each developer has a clone of the entire source repository, and each clone is managed locally until the changes are published to the central server. Developers are also free to create private local branches and switch from one branch to another without much hassle. Branches can be merged, published, or closed according to the requirements.</p><p>Xamarin Studio has native support for Git and developer commands such as <code class="literal">pull</code>, <code class="literal">clone</code>, <code class="literal">commit</code>, and <code class="literal">push</code> can be executed within the IDE. This native support makes Git repositories ideal candidates for developers using a Mac-based development environment.</p><p>Visual Studio also supports Git repositories and the classic Pull-Commit-Push flow. In addition to Visual Studio support, with recent updates to Visual Studio Team Services it is possible to create team projects using a Git repository. The selection of the Version Control type does not interfere with other project related options or the build setup. However, it is currently not possible to use the project management related features (for example, associating change sets with task items) using a Git repository.</p><div><img alt="Git" src="img/B04693_11_01.jpg"/><div><p>Figure 1: Team Foundation Server with Git</p></div></div><p>It is also<a class="indexterm" id="id649"/> possible to set up a team project that utilizes multiple types of repositories. These <a class="indexterm" id="id650"/>repositories can be accessed using only the latest version of Visual Studio (that is, Visual Studio 2015 Update 1) at the moment.</p><p>The next section provides additional integration options for scenarios involving TFS and Git repositories.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec131"/>TFS/Git scenarios</h2></div></div></div><p>In <a class="indexterm" id="id651"/>certain scenarios, developers can choose, or are obliged to use, Git <a class="indexterm" id="id652"/>repositories together with a centralized TFVC repository (for example, developers with a Mac OS development setup do not have direct integration with TFVC). In this kind of a situation, there are several available utilities and implementation patterns that can help teams prepare their development infrastructure.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl3sec43"/>Git bridge</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the integration<a class="indexterm" id="id653"/> paths that can be employed is the Git-TF tool maintained on CodePlex by Microsoft. The Git-TF tool is a platform agnostic tool written in Java. It utilizes TFVC APIs to enable developers to use a TFS repository together with a local Git repository.</p><p>In this<a class="indexterm" id="id654"/> integration path, either a single member or several members of a Xamarin development team can use a local or shared Git repository synchronized with the central repository using the Git-TF tool.</p><p>For a setup in which the individual developer uses a local Git repository in sync with TFVC, the TFS repository first needs to be cloned to the local machine:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>git tf clone http://myserver:8080/tfs $/TeamProjectA/Main</strong>
</pre></div><p>After cloning, development can continue on the local machine using the Git repository. Local commit executions will not be reflected on the central repository. In the meantime, the central repository can be merged with the local repository using the <code class="literal">pull</code> command of Git-TF:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>git tf pull --rebase</strong>
</pre></div><p>Once the development task is complete, the code can be checked in to TFS using the <code class="literal">checkin</code> command (instead of <code class="literal">git push</code>):</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>git tf checkin --associate=123,124 –-message="Additional items for Task 123"</strong>
</pre></div><p>Git-TF provides the option to associate/resolve work items on TFS and include check-in comments similar to a standard code check-in.</p><div><img alt="Git bridge" src="img/B04693_11_02.jpg"/><div><p>Figure 2: Git with TFVC repository</p></div></div><p>Another possibility would be to configure a shared Git repository for several team members so that each developer can clone it to their local environment and use it as a branch. In this setup, code merging and synchronization between the central repository (TFVC) and the shared Git repository would have to be handled by an administrator.</p><p>Similarly, the <a class="indexterm" id="id655"/>Git-TFS tool maintained on GitHub is an open-source project written in .NET and provides a bidirectional integration between TFS and Git repositories. However, this tool currently does not have a version available for Mac OS. Git-TFS provides support for some advanced TFS scenarios related to workspace handling and shelvesets.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl3sec44"/>NuGet packages</h3></div></div></div><p>As <a class="indexterm" id="id656"/>previously discussed, NuGet packages are one of the code sharing strategies in cross-platform projects using Xamarin. NuGet packages can also be utilized to create the bridge between TFVC and Git, possibly by providing PCL libraries for Xamarin target platforms.</p><p>For instance, we can consider a scenario where shared projects between Windows Store applications and Xamarin.iOS are implemented on a Windows-based development environment, whereas Xamarin.iOS development team members use a Mac OS development setup with Xamarin Studio. The team project in this example can include a TFVC repository (for shared code and Windows Store app implementation) and a Git repository (for Xamarin.iOS development). The synchronization between the two servers can be handled through NuGet packages.</p><p>NuGet packages can be built and deployed with <a class="indexterm" id="id657"/>
<strong>Continuous Integration</strong> (<strong>CI</strong>) build processes using out-of-the-box TFS build task definitions, making the NuGet process part of the development pipeline and continuous integration.</p><div><img alt="NuGet packages" src="img/B04693_11_03.jpg"/><div><p>Figure 3: Automated build for NuGet packages</p></div></div><p>For <a class="indexterm" id="id658"/>NuGet package distribution, on top of the commercially available products (for example, the Artifactory server), Visual Studio Team Services can also be used to create NuGet source feeds and publish them privately for members of the development team.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec132"/>Subversion (SVN)</h2></div></div></div><p>Subversion<a class="indexterm" id="id659"/> is<a class="indexterm" id="id660"/> another source control repository type, generally referred to as SVN or Apache Subversion. Subversion repositories can be readily created in Mac OS developer environments using XCode development tools. Xamarin Studio has native support for SVN (version 1.6 or higher). Subversion can be an easy solution for individual Xamarin developers who prefer a Mac-based development environment. Even though there are publicly available Visual Studio extensions and integration tools for the Windows environment enabling the use of SVN, natively supported Git and TFVC are generally preferred over SVN.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec65"/>Continuous integration</h1></div></div></div><p>Continuous integration (CI) is<a class="indexterm" id="id661"/> the name for the software practice involving the aforementioned source control management strategies, together with automated build/deploy and testing phases. Nowadays, CI generally refers to the automated build/deploy and testing phases <a class="indexterm" id="id662"/>of <strong>Application Lifecycle Management</strong> (<strong>ALM</strong>).</p><p>For Xamarin projects, software<a class="indexterm" id="id663"/> engineers are free to use a vast number of CI management tools, available both commercially and with freemium licensing (that is, limited features for free usage).</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec133"/>Visual Studio Team Services</h2></div></div></div><p><strong>Visual Studio Team Services</strong> (<strong>VSTS</strong>) is<a class="indexterm" id="id664"/> the <a class="indexterm" id="id665"/>cloud-based version of Team Foundation Server and provides convenient features for Xamarin developers. Currently available as a freemium subscription-based service, teams are free to manage a limited number projects with a limited number of team members.</p><p>In VSTS team projects, both Git and TFVC development repositories can be managed, planned, automatically built, tested, and possibly deployed (see the Beta deployment section for VSTS integration).</p><div><img alt="Visual Studio Team Services" src="img/B04693_11_04.jpg"/><div><p>Figure 4: TFS automated Xamarin builds</p></div></div><p>Out-of-the-box build templates that include Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android projects can be <a class="indexterm" id="id666"/>executed on hosted build agents. While the latter build template can be executed with a shared <a class="indexterm" id="id667"/>hosted build agent, Xamarin.iOS needs a specialized build host with Xamarin.iOS capabilities to be associated with the team project.</p><div><img alt="Visual Studio Team Services" src="img/B04693_11_05.jpg"/><div><p>Figure 5: VSTS hosted Android build agent</p></div></div><p>For the Xamarin.Android build template, developers are required to insert Xamarin license details. However the build agent does not occupy a license seat except for the duration of the build. The build definition template includes an activation step where the build agent is registered as an occupant of the Xamarin license, and another step after the build is complete to remove the license.</p><p>In VSTS, Xamarin Test Cloud can also be integrated to execute automated acceptance tests using the default build template.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec134"/>TeamCity</h2></div></div></div><p>TeamCity (JetBrains) is <a class="indexterm" id="id668"/>another CI server, which<a class="indexterm" id="id669"/> provides automated builds and a great number of integration scenarios for various platforms. TeamCity can be downloaded and installed locally on multiple operating systems (including OS X and Windows) and is available as a freemium product (with limited free build agent installations and build configurations).</p><p>For Xamarin development teams, the biggest advantage of TeamCity is the fact that it can be installed on Mac OS. Once the build server is configured (it can be on the same machine as the server running the TeamCity server), builds for Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS can be triggered on various actions, such as repository changes and schedules.</p><div><img alt="TeamCity" src="img/B04693_11_06.jpg"/><div><p>Figure 6: TeamCity with Xamarin projects</p></div></div><p>Additional possible integration scenarios and build steps in terms of Xamarin projects involve the Calabash instrumentation of application packages and Xamarin Test Cloud submission.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec135"/>Other</h2></div></div></div><p>Xamarin development teams have the luxury to be able to use many other online/cloud-based SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) providers, available for both internal and open source development. The most popular of these services is GitHub, which provides both private and public repositories as a subscription-based service. CI build providers such as AppVeyor and Travis CI have native integration with GitHub and can be readily used for various platform-specific build configurations.</p><p>Finally, Jenkins is another CI server which is available for free and commercial installations. Jenkins can be integrated with various repositories and can be configured to build and test Xamarin projects.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec66"/>Automated testing</h1></div></div></div><p>Automated testing, in <a class="indexterm" id="id670"/>other words running the unit tests or coded UI tests established as part of the development effort, is a fundamental part of the continuous integration cycle in most development projects.</p><p>To prepare a test fixture for a Xamarin project, developers can use various frameworks such as Visual Studio testing suite, nUnit, and xUnit. Moreover, Xamarin development teams have the freedom to choose from the available list of source control repositories and CI platforms. Fortunately, each of these aspects of a CI pipeline can be integrated without much hassle, due to the fact that the aforementioned testing frameworks provide test adapters for various configurations (except for the native Visual Studio testing framework).</p><p>For instance, let us consider a Xamarin project hosted on the TFVC repository on Visual Studio Team Services, where the unit test fixture is written utilizing the xUnit framework. As a first step, in order for the TFS build agent to facilitate the xUnit adapter to run the unit test fixture, the test adapter has to be installed as a NuGet package for the solution.</p><div><img alt="Automated testing" src="img/B04693_11_07.jpg"/><div><p>Figure 7: xUnit test adapter</p></div></div><p>After the <a class="indexterm" id="id671"/>adapter package is deployed to the source control repository, the team build can now include the testing step using the custom adapter.</p><p>In Visual Studio team builds, if the custom adapter is not defined, the tests are run using the default adapter. The build step, in this case, would report that no tests could be found.</p><div><img alt="Automated testing" src="img/B04693_11_08.jpg"/><div><p>Figure 8: xUnit test adapter setup</p></div></div><p>In this<a class="indexterm" id="id672"/> configuration, the <code class="literal">packages</code> folder of the solution for NuGet packages was used as the source directory (for example, <code class="literal">$(Build.SourcesDirectory)\Xamarin.Master.Fibonacci\packages\&lt;path&gt;</code>). It is also possible to use the <code class="literal">binaries</code> folder of the test project to access the adapter binary. It is also important to note that the MSBuild task prior to the Visual Studio Test task for the test projects is essential before executing the actual test fixture.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec67"/>Beta deployment</h1></div></div></div><p>Beta testing <a class="indexterm" id="id673"/>is an essential part of a Xamarin development pipeline. Using beta testing distribution hubs such as HockeyApp, Crashlytics, or Testflight, application packages can be delivered to beta users/testers. For Windows Phone 8.1 and Android, the distribution of application packages using simple networking methods is also possible (for example, using shared network locations, download links, and so on).</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec136"/>HockeyApp</h2></div></div></div><p>HockeyApp<a class="indexterm" id="id674"/> stands out as the only beta distribution hub that supports all <a class="indexterm" id="id675"/>Xamarin target platforms, including Windows Runtime, and has integration capabilities for various CI configurations.</p><p>Initially a beta testing platform for iOS and Android, the Stuttgart-based company expanded their SDK to support Microsoft mobile development platforms. HockeyApp was ultimately acquired by Microsoft. However, it continues to support various mobile platforms, including Mac OS.</p><div><img alt="HockeyApp" src="img/B04693_11_09.jpg"/><div><p>Figure 9: HockeyApp app dashboard</p></div></div><p>Application<a class="indexterm" id="id676"/> packages for the HockeyApp distribution hub can be uploaded directly from the web interface. Team members and/or beta testers should download the HockeyApp application to their mobile devices to be able to download the latest packages from the server.</p><p>In addition <a class="indexterm" id="id677"/>to manual release, HockeyApp provides two public APIs: one for clients and one for developers. The Client API is used to communicate with the server to deliver application runtime-related analytics, while the Developer API provides developers with the necessary functionality to upload and distribute application packages.</p><p>For Visual Studio Team Services (Visual Studio Online) and Jenkins, there are integration modules that make it possible to publish applications as part of CI builds.</p><div><img alt="HockeyApp" src="img/B04693_11_10.jpg"/><div><p>Figure 10: HockeyApp TFS build step</p></div></div><p>HockeyApp suite also includes crash analytics features that can be integrated into bug tracking systems such as Visual Studio Team Services, Assembla, BaseCamp, BitBucket, and so on.</p><p>HockeyApp offers free and enterprise licensing options.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec137"/>Crashlytics</h2></div></div></div><p>Crashlytics<a class="indexterm" id="id678"/> is another beta analysis platform, which provides distribution <a class="indexterm" id="id679"/>and crash reporting features for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android applications.</p><p>Crashlytics provides integration with other collaboration tools such as PivotalTracker, JIRA, GitHub, and BitBucket. It also offers a public API, providing service hooks for various integration scenarios.</p><p>Crashlytics was recently purchased by Twitter and continues to support the two Xamarin target platform applications. Crashlytics is currently part of the Twitter fabric development platform and is offered as a free service.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec138"/>TestFlight</h2></div></div></div><p>TestFlight, started <a class="indexterm" id="id680"/>as a beta testing platform for iOS and Android <a class="indexterm" id="id681"/>applications, immediately cancelled support for Android applications after their acquisition by Apple. It is now part of the Apple Developer Program and is only accessible through iTunes Connect.</p><p>Submissions to TestFlight are no different from actual Apple Store application packages. The final distributable package (<code class="literal">.ipa</code>) should be prepared for submission and uploaded using the Application Loader to Apple servers (see <a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. ALM – App Stores and Publishing">Chapter 12</a>, <em>ALM – App Stores and Publishing</em>, for further information).</p><p>Unfortunately, this process cannot currently be automated as there are no build integration options and no public API.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec139"/>Package distribution</h2></div></div></div><p>In <a class="indexterm" id="id682"/>contrast to iOS devices, both Android and <a class="indexterm" id="id683"/>Windows Phone devices can install and run application packages that are distributed via the Internet or mobile storage.</p><p>For Windows Phone 8 and 8.1, the testing device should be configured as a developer device using the Windows Phone SDK. In order for a developer to unlock Windows Phone devices, a Windows developer account is necessary (this is a free subscription):</p><div><img alt="Package distribution" src="img/B04693_11_11.jpg"/><div><p>Figure 11: Windows Phone developer unlock</p></div></div><p>After the <a class="indexterm" id="id684"/>registration step, developers can install application <a class="indexterm" id="id685"/>packages either using the SDK tools or, if there is hardware support, using an SD card and the default store application.</p><p>For Android platform, there are available freeware tools that can be used to install <code class="literal">.apk</code> packages. The default package manager can also be used to install custom application packages shared as a network resource.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec68"/>Live telemetry</h1></div></div></div><p>Live telemetry <a class="indexterm" id="id686"/>is the term used to define the analytical information collected from applications being used by their target audience or beta testers. These analytic values are invaluable for feature rich mobile applications to identify how the customers are actually engaging with these applications on different hardware configurations, since Xamarin applications may be targeting devices running iOS, Android, or Windows Phone with various hardware configurations and peripherals.</p><p>With telemetry, development teams can gather information about user input patterns in different scenarios, application utilization flows, and platform impediments/strengths. While statistical information such as this is essential for UX design, values such as crash/exception details, network connectivity, memory consumption, and other diagnostic data on real-world usage scenarios can be useful as health indicators for the application.</p><p>There are <a class="indexterm" id="id687"/>numerous telemetry providers and frameworks for Xamarin target platforms. These frameworks can be included in Xamarin applications through binding packages (for example, Google Analytics for Android applications), and telemetry platforms targeting Xamarin applications, such as Xamarin Insights and/or Microsoft Application Insights, can be included in Xamarin implementations.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec140"/>Xamarin Insights</h2></div></div></div><p>Xamarin Insights <a class="indexterm" id="id688"/>is the analytics and crash reporting<a class="indexterm" id="id689"/> platform built specifically for Xamarin target platforms. Xamarin Insights implementations can be used in each Xamarin platform project including Xamarin.Forms applications and Windows Runtime. This is a subscription-based service and live telemetry can be seen on the web-based dashboard.</p><p>In order to start using Xamarin Insights in a cross-platform application solution, Xamarin Insights NuGet package(s) should be included in platform-specific projects. After the framework client assemblies are introduced, Xamarin.Insights runtime can be initialized using the subscription key.</p><p>For instance, if we were to include and initialize the Xamarin Insights module in a Xamarin.Android application using MVVMCross implementation, the initialization can be included in the application setup:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">public class Setup : MvxAndroidSetup
{
    public Setup(Context applicationContext) : base(applicationContext)
    {
        Insights.Initialize("&lt;API Key&gt;", applicationContext);
        
        // Identifying the specific user, and follow the usage pattern in the rest of the execution
        var traits = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; {
            {Insights.Traits.Email, "john.smith@contoso.com"},
            {Insights.Traits.Name, "John Smith"}
        };
        Insights.Identify("john.smith@contoso.com ", traits);
    }
}</pre></div><p>In this implementation, the <code class="literal">Identify</code> method is an optional call. It is used to identify user-specific traits rather than general usage patterns.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note38"/>Note</h3><p>No matter which platform is running the Xamarin Insights content, the application should be enabled to use the Internet connection (that is, application manifest). It is also advised to enable permissions such as <code class="literal">BATTERY_STATS</code>, <code class="literal">READ_LOGS</code>, <code class="literal">ACCESS_WIFI_STATE</code>, and so on, on a Xamarin.Android application to collect additional information. Similarly, on Windows Phone 8, <code class="literal">ID_CAP_IDENTIFY_DEVICE</code> capability must be added to identify the specific device while recording telemetry.</p></div></div><p>Once the <a class="indexterm" id="id690"/>Xamarin Insights context is initialized, additional <a class="indexterm" id="id691"/>reporting calls can be executed on shared libraries (for example, ViewModel implementations).</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec141"/>Application Insights</h2></div></div></div><p>Application Insights is<a class="indexterm" id="id692"/> another subscription based service/platform <a class="indexterm" id="id693"/>that can be used with Xamarin applications. This cloud-based suite was initially released by Microsoft for web applications, but it slowly made its way into mobile applications. The application insights NuGet package(s) can be used with Xamarin.Android (API level 15 and higher) and Xamarin.iOS (version 6 and higher) applications. Application Insights, with a limited feature set, can be used on an unlimited number of devices with a limited amount of data processing for free.</p><p>Application Insights usage scenarios are, in essence, very similar to Xamarin Insights. The initial step is to use the platform-specific initializer to start the telemetry session. Once the telemetry context is created, an instance of a <code class="literal">TelemetryClient</code> can be used to either start automatic diagnostic recording or send manual data to the insights server:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var telemetryClient = new TelemetryClient();

 // User Action Event
 telemetryClient.TrackEvent("Calculation Completed");

 // Send a metric:
 telemetryClient.TrackMetric("Calculation Range", (ordinal2 - ordinal1));

 // Nominal values by which you can filter events:
 var nominalValues = new Dictionary&lt;string,string&gt; { {"calculation", "rangeCalculation"}};

 // Metrics associated with an event:
 var metrics = new Dictionary&lt;string,int&gt; 
         {
             {"ordinal1", ordinal1},
              {"ordinal2", ordinal2}
          };

 telemetryClient.TrackEvent("Calculation Completed", nominalValues, metrics);</pre></div><p>Together with <a class="indexterm" id="id694"/>crash analytics provided by HockeyApp, usage statics and server-side data (if any) with Application Insights for mobile application, live <a class="indexterm" id="id695"/>telemetry can provide valuable insights about Xamarin applications.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note39"/>Note</h3><p>Application Insights is slowly being transitioned out in favor of HockeyApp. This transition was first announced in November 2015 during the Connect() conference. As of April 2016, Microsoft will stop accepting new submissions for Xamarin applications as well as Windows Store and Windows Phone apps. In June 2016, the application insights data for mobile apps is completely being migrated to the HockeyApp.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec69"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Overall, tools available for the .NET platform can be easily utilized to manage and streamline the development pipeline tasks. On top of the Microsoft-based offerings, there are a number of service providers with the freemium subscription model. This can create great opportunities for individual/independent developers.</p><p>For source control, the most logical choices are Git and TFVC. While TFVC is an ideal solution for developers with a Windows-based development environment setup, Git provide native integration to Xamarin Studio on both Windows and Mac OS environments.</p><p>Independent from the repository choice, Visual Studio Team Services or other CI platforms such as TeamCity can be employed to create automated testing and build workflows.</p><p>Finally, beta testing and collected telemetry are fundamental elements for Xamarin projects. With real use-cases and analytical data on usage patterns, developers can fine-tune their applications and avoid problems before the actual release.</p><p>In the final chapter, we will be discussing the preparation steps for store submission and distribution options for Xamarin applications.</p></div></body></html>
