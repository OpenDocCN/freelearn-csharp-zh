<span class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Unity Scripting</em></span> is a concise and dedicated exploration of some advanced, unconventional, and powerful ways to script games with C# in Unity. This makes the book very important right now because, although plenty of "beginner" literature and tutorials exist for Unity, comparatively little has been said of more advanced subjects in a dedicated and structured form. The book assumes you're already familiar with the Unity basics, such as asset importing, level designing, light-mapping, and basic scripting in either C# or JavaScript. From the very beginning, it looks at practical case studies and examples of how scripting can be applied creatively to achieve more complex ends, which include subjects such as Debugging, Artificial Intelligence, Customized Rendering, Editor Extending, Animation and Motion, and lots more. The central purpose is not to demonstrate abstract principles and tips at the level of theory, but to show how theory can be put into practice in real-world examples, helping you get the most from your programming knowledge to build solid games that don't just work but work optimally. To get the most out of this book, read each chapter in sequence, from start to finish, and when reading, use a general and abstract mindset. That is, see each chapter as being simply a particular example and demonstration of more general principles that persist across time and spaces; ones that you can remove from the specific context in which I've used them and redeploy elsewhere to serve your needs. In short, see the knowledge here not just as related to the specific examples and case studies I've chosen, but as being highly relevant for your own projects. So, let's get started.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Unity C# Refresher">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity C# Refresher</em></span>, summarizes in very brief terms the basics of C# and scripting in Unity. It's not intended as a complete or comprehensive guide to the basics. Rather, it's intended as a refresher course for those who've previously studied the basics, but perhaps haven't scripted for a while and who'd appreciate a quick recap before getting started with the later chapters. If you're comfortable with the basics of scripting (such as classes, inheritance, properties, and polymorphism), then you can probably skip this chapter.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Debugging">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Debugging</em></span>, explores debugging in depth. Being able to write solid and effective code depends partially on your ability to find and successfully fix errors as and when they occur. This makes debugging is critical skill. This chapter will not only look at the basics, but will go deeper into debugging through the MonoDevelop interface, as well as establish a useful error-logging system.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Singletons, Statics, GameObjects, and the World">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Singletons, Statics, GameObjects, and the World</em></span>, explores a wide range of features for accessing, changing, and managing game objects. Specifically, we'll see the singleton design pattern for building global and persistent objects, as well as many other techniques for searching, listing, sorting, and arranging objects. Scripting in Unity relies on manipulating objects in a unified game world, or coordinate space to achieve believable results.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Event-driven Programming">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Event-driven Programming</em></span>, considers event-driven programming as an important route to re-conceiving the architecture of your game for optimization. By transferring heavy workloads from update and frequent events into an event-driven system, we'll free up lots of valuable processing time for achieving other tasks.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Cameras, Rendering, and Scenes">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Cameras, Rendering, and Scenes</em></span>, dives deep into seeing how cameras work, not just superficially, but how we can dig into their architecture and customize their rendered output. We'll explore frustum testing, culling issues, line of sight, orthographic projection, depth and layers, postprocess effects, and more.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Working with Mono">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Mono</em></span>, surveys the vast Mono library and some of its most useful classes, from dictionaries, lists, and stacks, to other features and concepts, such as strings, regular expressions and Linq. By the end of this chapter, you'll be better positioned to work with large quantities of data quickly and effectively.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Artificial Intelligence">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Artificial Intelligence</em></span>, manages to apply pretty much everything covered previously in one single example project that considers Artificial Intelligence: creating a clever enemy that performs a range of behaviors, from wandering, chasing, patrolling, attacking, fleeing and searching for health-power ups. In creating this character, we'll cover line-of-sight issues, proximity detection, and pathfinding.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Customizing the Unity Editor">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Customizing the Unity Editor</em></span>, focuses on the Unity Editor, which is feature filled in many respects, but sometimes you need or want it to do more. This chapter examines how to create editor classes for customizing the editor itself, to behave differently and work better. We'll create customized inspector properties, and even a fully functional localization system for switching your game seamlessly across multiple languages.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Working with Textures, Models, and 2D">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Textures, Models, and 2D</em></span>, explores many things you can do with 2D elements, such as sprites, textures, and GUI elements. Even for 3D games, 2D elements play an important role, and here we'll look at a range of 2D problems and also explore effective and powerful solutions.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Source Control and Other Tips">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Source Control and Other Tips</em></span>, closes the book on a general note. It considers a wide range of miscellaneous tips and tricks (useful concepts and applications) that don't fit into any specific category but are critically important when taken as a whole. We'll see good coding practices, tips for writing clear code, data serialization, source and version control integration, and more.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is a Unity-focused title, which means you only need a copy of Unity. Unity comes with everything you need to follow along with the book, including a code editor. Unity can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/">http://unity3d.com/</a>. Unity is a single application that supports two main licenses, free and pro. The free license restricts access to certain features, but nonetheless still gives you access to a powerful feature set. In general, most chapters and examples in this book are compliant with the free version, meaning that you can usually follow along with the free version. Some chapters and examples will, however, require the professional version.</p></div>
