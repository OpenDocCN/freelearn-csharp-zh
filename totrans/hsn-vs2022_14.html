		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Chapter 11: Implementing Git Integration</h1>
			<p>Having a change control platform for the development of a software project is essential for good control of the project. There are many different versioning systems, but <strong class="bold">Git</strong> is the most widely used system today, which is why more and more IDEs are including tools for managing repositories based on this technology natively. </p>
			<p>This has precisely happened with Visual Studio, which integrates a series of options to allow us to work with Git-based repositories.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you are going to learn how to work with Git repositories based on <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong>, which is the most popular repository-hosting platform today.</p>
			<p>The main topics we will see in the chapter are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Getting started with Git settings</li>
				<li>Creating a Git repository</li>
				<li>Cloning a Git repository</li>
				<li>Fetching, pulling, and pushing Git repositories</li>
				<li>Managing branches</li>
				<li>Viewing changes in repositories</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow along in the chapter, you must have installed Visual Studio with the workload set from <a href="B17873_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Visual Studio 2022</em>.</p>
			<p>Since the projects hosted in the main repository of the previous chapters already have a GitHub configuration, we will create a new project throughout the chapter to do the exercises. Therefore, a GitHub account is required, which can be created at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/signup">https://github.com/signup</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Getting started with Git settings</h1>
			<p>Starting to work with Git tools is very easy in Visual Studio 2022, since they are included as part of the installation <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>itself, so you can install Visual Studio and start working on your projects as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>To access the management of code projects hosted on GitHub, you must first sign in with a Microsoft account, as explained in <a href="B17873_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Visual Studio 2022</em>. Once logged in, click on the account profile icon and select the <strong class="bold">Account settings…</strong> option, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.01_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.1 – Accessing the account settings&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.1 – Accessing the account settings</p>
			<p>This will open an account customization window, where we can add a GitHub account via the <strong class="bold">+Add</strong> button, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.02_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.2 – The button to add a GitHub account&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.2 – The button to add a GitHub account</p>
			<p>Once we press the button, we will be redirected to the GitHub authentication portal, where we can log <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>in with an existing GitHub account or create an account if we don't have one. After successful authentication, we will be asked to authorize Visual Studio to interact with GitHub services, so it is essential to press the button that says <strong class="bold">Authorize github</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.3_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.3 – The authorization button to connect Visual Studio and GitHub&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.3 – The authorization button to connect Visual Studio and GitHub</p>
			<p>After this step, the GitHub account will have been added as part of the accounts associated with <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>the main Visual Studio account, so we can start working with the repositories of the GitHub account, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.4</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.04_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.4 – The GitHub account added to the account listing&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.4 – The GitHub account added to the account listing</p>
			<p>Now that we have associated a GitHub account, let's learn how to create Git repositories in GitHub.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Creating a Git repository</h1>
			<p>Creating a repository in GitHub from a Visual Studio project is very easy to do. In this section, you will <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>have to test your knowledge by creating a new <code>GitDemo</code>.</p>
			<p>To create the new repository in GitHub from the project you have created, just select the <strong class="bold">Git</strong> | <strong class="bold">Create Git Repository</strong> menu option and fill in the repository information, according to the data shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.5</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.05_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.5 – Filling in the information for a new repository on GitHub"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.5 – Filling in the information for a new repository on GitHub</p>
			<p>Let's briefly <a id="_idIndexMarker452"/>explain each option:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Local path</strong>: This sets the path on the local machine where the source code is hosted (usually the path where you created the project).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">.gitignore template</strong>: This allows you to select a template that establishes a set of files that will not be uploaded to the repository – for example, files that are generated after a compilation and can be regenerated on a different computer are selected by the selected template.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">License template</strong>: This allows you to choose a license for the repository code, which indicates what users can and cannot do with the project code.</li>
				<li><code>readme</code> file that describes the purpose of the repository.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Account</strong>: This allows you to select the GitHub account to which the repository will be published. It is possible to associate an account from here if one has not been associated before.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Owner</strong>: This allows you to set which GitHub account will be the owner of the repository if the account belongs to several work teams.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Repository name</strong>: This allows you <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>to set the name of the repository, although the project's own name is normally used. This will affect the URL of the final repository.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: This allows you to enter a description of the repository created.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Private repository</strong>: This allows you to set whether the repository will be public or private.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once these <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>values are set, just click on the <strong class="bold">Create and Push</strong> button to start the repository creation process. It is important that you follow this step in your GitHub account so that you can carry out the activities in the following sections. </p>
			<p>There are several signs to identify whether a project belongs to a Git repository, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.6</em>, such as lock icons on the left side of source files, which indicate that they are the original repository files:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.06_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.6 – Signs to identify a versioned project with Git&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.6 – Signs to identify a versioned project with Git</p>
			<p>Another sign to <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>identify whether a project belongs to a Git repository is that (as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.6</em>) at the bottom, there is a branch icon, indicating which branch we are working on. In our case, the branch is <strong class="bold">master</strong>.</p>
			<p>Now that we know how to create a new repository, let's see how to clone a repository to our local machine.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Cloning a Git repository</h1>
			<p>It may be the case that you want to clone an existing repository and not start from scratch because <a id="_idIndexMarker456"/>you need to work in a team, or simply while browsing the GitHub site, you came across a repository that caught your attention. </p>
			<p>The easiest way to clone a repository is from the initial window of Visual Studio, which can be reached by either starting a new instance of Visual Studio, closing an open project, or from the <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Start Window</strong> menu. In this window, the first option is the <strong class="bold">Clone a repository</strong> button:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.07_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.7 – The Clone a repository option from the startup window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.7 – The Clone a repository option from the startup window</p>
			<p>Once we press <a id="_idIndexMarker457"/>this button, a new window (shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.8</em>) will open, asking us to indicate the URL of the remote repository and the local path where the source code files will be stored:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.08_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.8 – The window for cloning a repository&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.8 – The window for cloning a repository</p>
			<p>For the purposes <a id="_idIndexMarker458"/>of this demonstration, we will use the URL of the repository created in the <em class="italic">Creating a Git repository</em> section, which should look like this: <code>https://github.com/{your-github-username-here}/GitDemo</code>.</p>
			<p>Because we previously created a project with the same name in the <em class="italic">Creating a Git repository</em> section, we have to indicate a different path for the project. For simplicity, we will change the name of the folder to <code>GitDemo2</code>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.8</em>:</p>
			<p>After filling in the information in the window, we will proceed to click on the <strong class="bold">Clone</strong> button, which will start the process of cloning the repository locally. Once the process is finished, the <strong class="bold">Solution Explorer</strong> window will show you a folder view:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.09_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.9 – The folder view on the Solution Explorer window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.9 – The folder view on the Solution Explorer window</p>
			<p>To switch from <a id="_idIndexMarker459"/>the folder view to the solution view, and to be able to work with the source files, you must open the solution by clicking on the <code>GitDemo.sln</code> file. This will open the solution and all its files, allowing us to work on the source files, as we have done so far.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It is possible to change the default folder view to the solution view by selecting the option located at <strong class="bold">Git</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Git Global Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Automatically load the solution when opening a Git repository</strong>.</p>
			<p>Now that we have learned how to clone repositories, let's see how we can perform pushing and pulling actions on repositories.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Fetching, pulling, and pushing Git repositories</h1>
			<p>The most important <a id="_idIndexMarker460"/>commands when working with Git repositories <a id="_idIndexMarker461"/>have to do with fetching, pulling, and pushing operations. There <a id="_idIndexMarker462"/>are two main ways to execute these operations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first way is by accessing through the <strong class="bold">Git</strong> menu, as shown here:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.10_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.10 – Accessing the Fetch, Pull, and Push operations from the menu&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.10 – Accessing the Fetch, Pull, and Push operations from the menu</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The second is to enable the <strong class="bold">Git Changes</strong> window, which you can open through the <strong class="bold">View</strong> | <strong class="bold">Git Changes</strong> menu, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.11_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.11 – Accessing the Fetch, Pull, and Push operations from the Git Changes window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.11 – Accessing the Fetch, Pull, and Push operations from the Git Changes window</p>
			<p>At this <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>point, you <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>may be wondering <a id="_idIndexMarker465"/>what each of these operations is for. So, let's now explain them briefly.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Fetching repositories</h2>
			<p>The fetch operation <a id="_idIndexMarker466"/>allows you to check whether there are remote commits that should be incorporated into the local repository. </p>
			<p>To run this example, go to the GitHub portal, log in if you are not already logged in, and open the repository we created in the <em class="italic">Creating a Git repository</em> section called <code>GitDemo</code>. Once you are in the repository, go to the <code>Program.cs</code> file and click on the pencil icon, which will allow you to edit the file, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.12_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.12 – The button to edit a repository file&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.12 – The button to edit a repository file</p>
			<p>We will make a very simple change by adding a pair of exclamation marks at the end of the string in line four:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">app.MapGet("/", () =&gt; "Hello World!<strong class="bold">!!</strong>");</pre>
			<p>Once this <a id="_idIndexMarker467"/>change has been made, go to the bottom of the page and click on the green button to commit the changes:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.13_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.13 – The button to commit changes on the repository&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.13 – The button to commit changes on the repository</p>
			<p>If we now go to Visual Studio and click on the <strong class="bold">Fetch</strong> button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.14</em>, we can see a <strong class="bold">0 outgoing / 1 incoming</strong> message, indicating that there is a change in the repository that <a id="_idIndexMarker468"/>has not been applied to the local project:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.14_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.14 – The button for fetching from the repository&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.14 – The button for fetching from the repository</p>
			<p>Additionally, if we click on this message, a new window will open, which will show us the version history of the project, showing us which changes we have not been applied locally:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.15_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.15 – The window showing the pending changes to be applied to the local repository&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.15 – The window showing the pending changes to be applied to the local repository</p>
			<p>It should be <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>noted that the fetch operation does not make any changes locally or in the remote repository, which the pull and push operations do. We will discuss these operations next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Pulling repositories</h2>
			<p>A pull operation <a id="_idIndexMarker470"/>refers to the act of downloading the latest changes from the repository to our local project. In the <em class="italic">Fetching repositories</em> section, we saw that we have a pending change to apply. So, we will proceed to click on the <strong class="bold">Pull</strong> button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.16</em>, to apply it:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.16_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.16 – The button for pulling changes&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.16 – The button for pulling changes</p>
			<p>Once the <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>changes have been downloaded, a message will appear, indicating which commit has been applied to the current project, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.17</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.17_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.17 – The window showing the applied commit and the changes in it&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.17 – The window showing the applied commit and the changes in it</p>
			<p>If we click <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/>on the name of the commit, a window will appear, showing the changes that have been applied to the project, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.17</em>.</p>
			<p>In this section, although we have made a change in the remote repository from the main GitHub site, the most common way to do it is from Visual Studio itself. That is why, in the next section, we will analyze how to perform push operations to the repositories.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Pushing to repositories</h2>
			<p>A push operation refers to uploading changes to a repository. To demonstrate how this operation <a id="_idIndexMarker473"/>works, let's open the <code>Program.cs</code> file and modify line four, changing the <code>Hello World</code> string to <code>Hello Git</code>:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">app.MapGet("/", () =&gt; "<strong class="bold">Hello Git</strong>!!!");</pre>
			<p>Immediately, you will see that the file icon in the <strong class="bold">Solution Explorer</strong> changes to a red checkmark, indicating that there has been a change in the local repository, which we can upload to the repository on GitHub: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.18_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.18 – The checkmark indicating that the original file has been modified&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.18 – The checkmark indicating that the original file has been modified</p>
			<p>Similarly, in the <strong class="bold">Git Changes</strong> window, you <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>will see a list of those files that have changes and can be uploaded to the repository, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.19</em>: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.19_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.19 – The list of files with changes that can be uploaded to the remote repository&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.19 – The list of files with changes that can be uploaded to the remote repository</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, we can also see a button with the <strong class="bold">Commit All</strong> legend. This button is <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>used to create a commit locally, without affecting the remote repository. This is a drop-down button that contains more options we can use, such as the <strong class="bold">Commit All and Push</strong> option. This option will push the changes to the remote repository.</p>
			<p>For our demonstration, we will add the <strong class="bold">Modified Program.cs</strong> message, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.20</em>, and click on the <strong class="bold">Commit All and Push</strong> option, to apply the changes on the server:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.20_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.20 – The message added and the Commit All and Push option&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.20 – The message added and the Commit All and Push option</p>
			<p>If you go <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>to the online repository in your GitHub account, you will see that the changes have been applied successfully.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It is recommended that before executing a push operation, you always perform a pull operation to avoid merge conflicts as much as possible. You can use the <strong class="bold">Sync (Pull then Push)</strong> button to perform both actions one after another.</p>
			<p>Now that we have analyzed how to execute the most common operations in GitHub, let's see how to work with branches in Visual Studio.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Managing branches</h1>
			<p>So far, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker477"/>been working with the main branch of our project called <strong class="bold">master</strong>. Imagine this <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>branch as a timeline, where each event is performed by a commit. This is very useful when there is some conflict and you need to go back to a previous version, undoing the changes of a specific commit. </p>
			<p>However, if you are working in a team, it is common that you will need to add a functionality in some kind of sandbox, before merging this functionality into the master branch. It is in this sort of scenario where Git branches will help us, allowing us to create a new project branch from an existing repository branch and work on it without affecting the functionality of the main repository.</p>
			<p>To create a new branch, just go to the <strong class="bold">Git</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Branch</strong> menu. This will open a new window that <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>asks for the branch name, the branch on which the new branch will be based, and a checkbox labeled <strong class="bold">Checkout branch</strong>, which, if checked, will transition to the new branch once it is created.</p>
			<p>For this demonstration, let's use <code>branch01</code> as the name of the branch, which will be based on the <strong class="bold">master</strong> branch, and leave the checkbox selected, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.21</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.21_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.21 – Creating a new branch&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.21 – Creating a new branch</p>
			<p>Once the new branch has been created, we can apply as many changes as we need. In our example, we will open the <code>Program.cs</code> file and modify line four again, with the following code:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">app.MapGet("/", () =&gt; "Hello Git!!!<strong class="bold"> - branch01</strong>");</pre>
			<p>Once this <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>change has been made, we will push the code as shown in the <em class="italic">Pushing to repositories</em> section, making sure to apply the change to <strong class="bold">branch01</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.22</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.22_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.22 – Pushing changes to the new branch&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.22 – Pushing changes to the new branch</p>
			<p>This allows us to add functionality on an isolated remote repository without affecting the operation of the <strong class="bold">master</strong> branch.</p>
			<p>Once you have your code tested, you will probably want to integrate it back into the <strong class="bold">master</strong> branch. This can be done from the <strong class="bold">View</strong> | <strong class="bold">Git Repository</strong> window. In this window, we will have a section called <strong class="bold">Branches</strong>, where we will see the list of the different branches in our project. Just right-click on the <strong class="bold">master</strong> branch and click on the <strong class="bold">Checkout</strong> option to switch to the master branch, which is where we will add the <strong class="bold">branch01</strong> changes. Then, right-click on the <strong class="bold">branch01</strong> branch and select the <strong class="bold">Merge 'branch01' into 'master'</strong> option:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.23_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.23 – Merging branches&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.23 – Merging branches</p>
			<p>This will cause the <strong class="bold">branch01</strong> branch to be merged with the <strong class="bold">master</strong> branch, which means that <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>the new functionality will be integrated into the project. </p>
			<p>Now that we have seen how to create branches and merge them, it is time to see how Visual Studio allows us to visualize the changes while editing the source code.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Viewing changes in repositories</h1>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>several ways in which Visual Studio helps us to visualize the changes in the repositories. The first one is through the <strong class="bold">Git Repository</strong> window, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.24_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.24 – The Git Repository window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.24 – The Git Repository window</p>
			<p>This window <a id="_idIndexMarker483"/>allows us to visualize whether there are versions that have not been applied in our local repository through <strong class="bold">Incoming</strong>, whether there are commits made locally but not pushed to the server through <strong class="bold">Outgoing</strong>, and also <strong class="bold">Local History</strong>.</p>
			<p>If we want to visualize the changes that have occurred between different commits, just right-click on two or more commits and select the <strong class="bold">Compare Commits…</strong> option:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.25_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.25 – The Compare Commits… option&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.25 – The Compare Commits… option</p>
			<p>This will <a id="_idIndexMarker484"/>display a new window with the changes that occurred between the different source files.</p>
			<p>Another way to view changes to a single file is to right-click on a file in the <strong class="bold">Solution Explorer</strong> and then select the <strong class="bold">Git</strong> | <strong class="bold">View History</strong> option, which will open the changes window for the selected file only, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.26</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.26_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 11.26 – The option to view the history of changes to a specific file&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.26 – The option to view the history of changes to a specific file</p>
			<p>Finally, we already <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>discussed the CodeLens functionality in <a href="B17873_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor088"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Coding Efficiently with AI and Code Views</em>, which also contains functionality to view changes to the members of a class, such as the history of changes and who made modifications to a member.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we have learned how Visual Studio integrates tools so that we can easily manage projects using Git and GitHub.</p>
			<p>Knowing how to work with Git-based projects is indispensable for all developers who want to manage their projects in a more controlled way, with the purpose of having an overview of a project structure in previous versions.</p>
			<p>Likewise, if you work with other developers, you will be able to share project tasks, test them independently, and merge them when the code is reliable, in order not to damage the source code that has already been tested.</p>
			<p>That is why we have learned how to set up a GitHub account in Visual Studio, how to create and clone repositories, how to perform fetch, pull, and push operations, how to manage branches in our projects, and finally, how to visualize changes in repositories.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, <a href="B17873_12_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor142"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sharing Code with Live Share</em>, you will learn how to work collaboratively with a development team on the same project in real time, thanks to the use of Live Share.</p>
