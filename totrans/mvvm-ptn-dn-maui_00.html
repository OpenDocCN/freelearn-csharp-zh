<p>In an era where software design patterns and frameworks are at the heart of robust application development, mastering the <strong class="bold">Model-View-ViewModel</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVVM</strong>) pattern becomes crucial for developers stepping into the domain of .NET MAUI. <em class="italic">The MVVM Pattern in .NET MAUI</em>: A definitive guide to essential patterns, best practices, and techniques, has been meticulously crafted to serve as a guide for developers eager to embark on <span class="No-Break">this journey.</span></p>
<p>What sets this book apart is its laser focus on .NET MAUI. We don’t just talk about MVVM in general; we delve deep into its practical application within this specific framework. Even if you’re new to MVVM or just starting with .NET MAUI, this guide is crafted to be both accessible <span class="No-Break">and enriching.</span></p>
<p>Our journey begins with an in-depth exploration of the MVVM design pattern and the core components of the .NET MAUI framework. As we progress, we’ll navigate through the intricacies of data binding, harnessing the power of community toolkits, and managing collections effectively. We’ll dive deeper to understand dependency injection, service patterns, and messaging, and you will learn about different methods of navigation, understand user input and validation, and master the techniques of working with remote data. The latter chapters guide you through creating MVVM-friendly controls, localizing your applications, and the pivotal aspect of <span class="No-Break">unit testing.</span></p>
<p>From these fundamentals to advanced techniques, by the end of this journey, you’ll be fully equipped with the knowledge to integrate MVVM effectively into your .NET <span class="No-Break">MAUI projects.</span></p>
<p>Welcome to your <span class="No-Break">definitive guide!</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is tailored toward developers who aim to harness the power of the MVVM pattern within the context of .NET MAUI. Whether you’re an enthusiast beginning your journey with .NET MAUI or a seasoned professional aiming to up their game in both .NET MAUI and MVVM, this guide has got <span class="No-Break">you covered.</span></p>
<p>While prior experience with .NET MAUI or Xamarin.Forms aren’t necessary, a foundational understanding of C# is essential.

    &lt;Image
        x:Name="favoriteIcon"
        Grid.Column="1" Margin="5"
        HeightRequest="35" Source="favorite.png"
        VerticalOptions="Center" WidthRequest="35"&gt;

&lt;/Grid&gt;</pre> <p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set <span class="No-Break">in bold:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
private bool _hideAllergenInformation = true;
public bool HideAllergenInformation
{
    get =&gt; _hideAllergenInformation;
    set =&gt; <strong class="bold">SetProperty(ref _hideAllergenInformation, value);</strong>

<p>In this part, we start by discussing the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern without tying it to a specific platform. Next, we'll introduce the .NET MAUI framework and highlight why it works so well with MVVM. As we move forward, you'll learn about the benefits of community toolkits and get hands-on experience with collections. This foundation sets you up for more advanced topics <span class="No-Break">later on.</span></p>
