- en: WinUI 3 is the newest desktop UI framework for Windows application development.
    It is part of Microsoft’s Windows App SDK, providing developers with the tools
    to build beautiful apps with the Fluent Design System. This book will quickly
    get you up to speed with WinUI to build new Windows applications and to build
    apps across platforms with technologies such as Blazor and Uno Platform.

- en: The book begins by exploring the history of Windows UI development frameworks
    to gain an understanding of how earlier frameworks influenced WinUI as it exists
    today. It covers the basics of XAML-based UI development and explores the controls
    available in WinUI before moving on to an examination of patterns and best practices
    for WinUI developers. To help reinforce these concepts, the early chapters in
    the book build practical skills by creating an application to organize a collection
    of books, music, and movies. Each chapter enhances the application, with new controls
    and concepts discussed.

- en: Later chapters in the book explore how developers can leverage their WinUI knowledge
    to leverage open source toolkits, integrate web content in Windows apps, and migrate
    WinUI apps to Android, iOS, and the web. The book finishes by teaching some essential
    Visual Studio debugging techniques and discussing app deployment options to get
    your apps in the hands of consumers and enterprise users. At the end of every
    chapter, I've included a series of questions for you to attempt on your own, enabling
    you to gauge your level of understanding. Learn how WinUI can help you build and
    deploy modern, robust applications!

- en: WinUI 3 is Microsoft’s latest UI framework for Windows developers. This section
    will start by exploring the recent history of XAML and Windows UI frameworks and
    introduce you to WinUI. Throughout the chapters of this section, you will learn
    about WinUI concepts by building a simple project from scratch and adding controls
    and features, by following design patterns and best practices. These patterns
    and practices include the **Model-View-ViewModel** (**MVVM**) design pattern,
    building loosely coupled, testable C# classes, and using **dependency injection**
    (**DI**) to inject service dependencies into the application components.
