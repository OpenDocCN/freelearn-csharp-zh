  <div><h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-616">Epilogue</h1>
    <p class="normal">I wanted this book to be different from the others on the market. I hope that you found it to be a brisk, fun read, packed with practical, hands-on walkthroughs of each subject. </p>
    <p class="normal">This epilogue contains the following short sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Cloud-native development using .NET Aspire</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Introducing the Survey Project Challenge</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Third edition coming in December 2025</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Next steps on your C# and .NET learning journey</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Good luck!</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-617">Cloud-native development using .NET Aspire</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this book you have seen lots of technologies that are used to build cloud-native applications, like gRPC for efficient communication between services, caching of various types, and fault tolerance using Polly.</p>
    <p class="normal">As you implement more and more of these technologies, managing your development environment gets harder and harder. Connection strings, secret keys, port numbers, rate limiting, and caching configurations: if any are wrong, things break, or work in unexpected ways, and it can be hard to identify and then fix the issue.</p>
    <p class="normal">At .NET Conf 2023 on November 14, 2023, the .NET team announced a new product: <strong class="keyWord">.NET Aspire</strong>. It is currently available in preview and the team plan to release version 1.0 in the spring of 2024.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">If you want to try out the preview, then when installing Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9 Preview 1 or later, make sure to select <strong class="screenText">.NET Aspire SDK (Preview)</strong> under the <strong class="screenText">Individual components</strong> tab.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">As stated in the official announcement blog article, .NET Aspire “is an opinionated stack for building resilient, observable, and configurable cloud-native applications with .NET.”</p>
    <p class="normal">It provides the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Aspire components</strong>: Based on existing mature technologies like Redis and OpenTelemetry, but wrapped in Aspire-specific packages that provide quick and easy configuration, Aspire components provide standardized functionality including service discovery, telemetry, resilience, and health checks.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Aspire Starter and Empty project templates</strong>: These will get you started with a working solution to try out Aspire features. The starter solution includes several projects: a Blazor app front-end for a dashboard to monitor all the services and apps you build, a back-end web API, a shared project for setting defaults that will apply to all projects, and an Aspire host to manage everything.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Aspire Orchestration</strong>: This provides features to run and connect complex multi-project applications and their dependencies. Custom extension methods are written for you to configure all the components in your projects following best practices, but you can change them if you have special requirements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">If you want to learn more about .NET Aspire, you can read the documentation at the following link:</p>
    <p class="normal"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/</a></p>
    <p class="normal">I plan to write a chapter about .NET Aspire in the third book of my .NET 8 trilogy, <em class="italic">Tools and Skills for .NET 8 Pros</em>, which we plan to publish in the first half of 2024.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-618">Introducing the Survey Project Challenge</h1>
    <p class="normal">To help us learn all the different technologies that .NET developers need to know these days, it would be great to attempt to implement a project that needs a mix of technologies and skills. It should be as real as possible, be cool, fun, and practical, and have already been implemented by others with public products that we can be inspired by.</p>
    <p class="normal">The Survey Project Challenge is an optional complete project with a common set of problems that will give you a real-world set of projects to build. You can read more about it at the following link:</p>

    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-619">Third edition coming in December 2025</h1>
    <p class="normal">I have already started work on identifying areas for improvement for the next edition, which we plan to publish about a month after the <strong class="keyWord">general availability</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">GA</strong>) release of .NET 10 in November 2025. While I do not expect major new features at the level of the unification of the Blazor hosting models, I do expect .NET 9 and .NET 10 to make worthwhile improvements to all aspects of .NET.</p>

    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-620">Next steps on your C# and .NET learning journey</h1>
    <p class="normal">There is never enough space in a book written for print to include everything one might want. For subjects that you want to learn more about, I hope that the notes, good practice tips, and links in the GitHub repository point you in the right direction:</p>

    <h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-621">Companion books to continue your learning journey</h2>
    <p class="normal">Soon, I will have written a trilogy of books to continue your learning journey with .NET 8. The two other books act as companions to this book:</p>
    <ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">The first book covers the fundamentals of C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, and Blazor for web development.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">The second book (the one you’re reading now) covers more specialized libraries, services, and graphical user interfaces for websites and desktop and mobile apps with Blazor and .NET MAUI.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">The third book covers important tools and skills you should learn to become a well-rounded professional .NET developer. These include design patterns and solution architecture, debugging, memory analysis, all the important types of testing, from unit to performance and web and mobile, and then hosting and deployment topics like Docker and Azure Pipelines. Finally, it looks at how to prepare for an interview to get the .NET developer job that you want.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">A summary of the .NET 8 trilogy and their most important topics is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.1</em>:</p>
