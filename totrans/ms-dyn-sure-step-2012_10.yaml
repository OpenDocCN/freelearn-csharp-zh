    the discipline and rigor to carry out the project plan. Those that are substantially
    late tend to be fraught with serious issues and with out-of-control changes in
    requirements and scope—all of which are issues that a service provider must have

  zh: 我们现在所了解的Sure Step
- en: Since its initial release in 2007, Sure Step has evolved beyond focusing on
    deploying Microsoft Dynamics solutions. With every release of Sure Step, the design
    of the tools and methodology has been expanded to encompass a number of additional
    use cases, including recent industry/vertical and cross-industry/horizontal solutions.
    The underlying objective of Sure Step continues to be to help customers in the
    selection and successful delivery of their Microsoft Dynamics solutions, but the
    value proposition for the use of Sure Step extends beyond that.

  zh: 自2007年首次发布以来，Sure Step已经超越了仅仅关注部署Microsoft Dynamics解决方案的范畴。随着Sure Step的每一次发布，工具和方法论的设计都得到了扩展，以涵盖包括最近行业/垂直和跨行业/水平解决方案在内的更多用例。Sure
    Step的潜在目标始终是帮助客户在选择和成功交付他们的Microsoft Dynamics解决方案，但Sure Step的使用价值已经超越了这一点。

  zh: Sure Step的价值主张
- en: The first and foremost value proposition of Sure Step remains the consistent
    framework for solution delivery that it provides. The processes in Sure Step are
    repeatable and extendable, giving organizations the ability to build on past learning,
    thereby leading to high-quality engagements that maximize the resources and speed
    up the time-to-value for customers. Sure Step provides solid approaches for project
    scope control and management, early risk identification and mediation, and quality
    assurance and control, throughout the life cycle of the engagement. These approaches
    are, of course, valuable for the delivery organizations, but they are also very
    valuable to the customer teams involved in solution delivery.
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Sure Step的首要价值主张仍然是它提供的持续解决方案交付框架。Sure Step中的流程是可重复和可扩展的，这使组织能够建立在过去学习的基础上，从而实现高质量的互动，最大化客户资源并加快客户的价值实现时间。Sure
    Step在整个合作生命周期中提供了稳健的项目范围控制和管理的途径，早期风险识别和调解，以及质量保证和控制。当然，这些途径对于交付组织来说是有价值的，但对于参与解决方案交付的客户团队来说也非常有价值。
- en: For a consulting organization, Sure Step provides a common thread across groups.
    Consultants often have varied backgrounds when it comes to ERP/CRM solution deployments.
    The experienced consultants may have deployed other competitive systems, and they
    may each have their own preferred approach to the engagement. While having different
    perspectives is certainly a good thing, having a team work cohesively is of paramount
    importance to the customer when it comes to easing any organizational change that
    is intrinsic to business solution engagements. That is why, having consulting
    teams use the same taxonomy and terminology of Sure Step helps them mature together
    as an organization and work closely with each other.
  id: totrans-12

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 对于咨询组织来说，Sure Step 在各个团队之间提供了一个共同的主线。在 ERP/CRM 解决方案部署方面，顾问们往往有着不同的背景。经验丰富的顾问可能部署过其他竞争性系统，他们可能各自有自己的参与偏好。虽然不同的观点当然是一件好事，但当涉及到减轻业务解决方案参与中固有的组织变革时，一个团队协同工作对于客户来说至关重要。这就是为什么，让咨询团队使用
    Sure Step 的相同分类法和术语，有助于他们作为一个组织共同成熟，并紧密合作。
- en: The second key value proposition for Sure Step is that it provides a thorough
    and viable process for customers and sellers to follow in-product selection and
    solution selling. Sure Step V2 introduced users to an expanded Diagnostic phase
    with Decision Accelerator Offerings. The Decision Accelerator Offerings and services
    continue getting built up with each subsequent release, and Sure Step provides
    strong guidelines, processes, and content to support both the customer and the
    solution provider. Given the criticality of business solutions, which we have
    belabored many a time in the previous chapters, this value proposition cannot
    be stressed upon enough. The tie-in to **Microsoft Solution Selling Process**
    (**MSSP**) and its inherent focus on customer due diligence, if executed per the
    guidance provided, alleviates the risks for the customer and sales organizations.
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Sure Step 的第二个关键价值主张是，它为顾客和销售者提供了一个详尽可行的流程，用于产品选择和解决方案销售。Sure Step V2 向用户介绍了扩展的诊断阶段，包括决策加速方案。决策加速方案和服务随着每个后续版本的发布而不断建立，Sure
    Step 提供了强大的指南、流程和内容，以支持客户和解决方案提供商。鉴于业务解决方案的重要性，我们在前几章中多次强调，这一价值主张的重要性不容忽视。与 **Microsoft
    Solution Selling Process** (**MSSP**) 的结合及其内在的客户尽职调查重点，如果按照提供的指导执行，可以减轻客户和销售组织面临的风险。
- en: The connection and flow from the Diagnostic phase to the implementation phases
    also facilitates information flow between the sales and delivery teams. Knowledge
    gained during the pre-sales cycles by pre-sales resources can be captured and
    transitioned to the implementation teams to avoid misalignment between expectations
    set in the sales cycle and the solution delivered during implementation. This
    helps the sales and consulting teams, and to an extent, the post-implementation
    support groups, to work together in the customer's best interests, rather than
    be in silos.
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 从诊断阶段到实施阶段的连接和流程也促进了销售和交付团队之间的信息流动。在销售周期之前，由销售资源获得的知识可以被捕捉并过渡到实施团队，以避免销售周期中设定的期望与实施期间交付的解决方案之间的不一致。这有助于销售和咨询团队，以及在某种程度上，实施后的支持团队，在客户最佳利益的基础上共同工作，而不是孤立无援。
- en: Sure Step has also been enhanced over time with multiple Implementation project
    types to support the method preferred by the customer and the implementer. These
    project types form the basis of the Sure Step Implementation offerings. Apart
    from Decision Accelerator and Implementation offerings, the methodology also provides
    Optimization offerings. These Optimization offerings include Technical Proactive
    Review services, to afford additional quality assurance during the life cycle
    of an implementation, Project Governance services, to ensure the scope and quality
    of the implementation, and Technical Post Go-Live services, such as health check
    and performance tuning, to ensure the optimal running of the solution in production.
    With these offerings, Sure Step has also evolved into a full customer-life cycle
    methodology. Customers and partners begin their relationship in the Diagnostic
    phase, continue through the implementation of the solution, maintain the relationship
    with **Post Go-Live** offerings, and resume the partnership by working together
    on solution upgrades.
  id: totrans-15

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 随着时间的推移，Sure Step还增加了多种实施项目类型，以支持客户和实施者偏好的方法。这些项目类型构成了Sure Step实施产品的基础。除了决策加速器和实施产品外，该方法还提供优化产品。这些优化产品包括技术主动审查服务，以在实施的生命周期中提供额外的质量保证，项目治理服务，以确保实施的范围和质量，以及技术上线后服务，如健康检查和性能调整，以确保解决方案在生产中的最佳运行。有了这些产品，Sure
    Step也发展成为一个完整的客户生命周期方法。客户和合作伙伴从诊断阶段开始建立关系，继续通过解决方案的实施，通过**上线后**产品维持关系，并通过共同工作在解决方案升级上恢复合作关系。
- en: Another very important value proposition of Sure Step is its innate ability
    to facilitate knowledge management. You may remember from the previous discussions
    that the activities in Sure Step project type workflows are numbered, and these
    numbers also persist through to the project plans and deliverables produced. Thus,
    any documentation, such as a Functional Requirement Document or a User Acceptance
    Test Script, follows a numerical sequence that allows easy tracking, storage,
    retrieval, and a potential harvest on future engagements. This can form the basis
    of any good **Knowledge Management** (**KM**) system. A good KM system helps the
    service provider to be more effective in their execution of engagements, but it
    can also help them prove their experience in a given area to their customers,
    thereby building customer confidence in their services. Of course, KM is not just
    the domain for the service provider; customers also maintain KM systems. The Sure
    Step taxonomy can also help customers in terms of having clear documentation on
    what was implemented and how it was implemented. It could also give them a good
    reference for future business solution engagements across their organization.
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Sure Step的另一个非常重要的价值主张是其固有的促进知识管理的能力。您可能还记得之前的讨论中提到，Sure Step项目类型工作流程中的活动是编号的，这些数字也延续到产生的项目计划和交付成果中。因此，任何文档，例如功能需求文档或用户验收测试脚本，都遵循一个数字序列，这使得跟踪、存储、检索以及在未来的合作中潜在地收获变得容易。这可以成为任何良好**知识管理系统（KM**）的基础。一个良好的KM系统有助于服务提供商在执行合作中更加高效，但它也可以帮助他们向客户证明他们在特定领域的经验，从而建立客户对他们的服务的信心。当然，KM不仅仅是服务提供商的领域；客户也维护KM系统。Sure
    Step的分类法还可以帮助客户在明确了解已实施的内容及其实施方式方面。它还可以为他们提供未来在整个组织内进行业务解决方案合作的良好参考。
- en: Last but not least is the Training value proposition for Sure Step, for both
    the service provider and the customer. We have heard many partner organizations
    talk about how Sure Step gives them a good structure for creating a training/ramp-up
    program for their new consulting resources. We have all started on new jobs at
    some point in our careers and we remember the butterflies in our stomach as we
    began a new job in spite of the level of confidence that we may have had that
    we were the right person for the role. Knowing that there is a structured process
    to follow can only ease the initial uneasiness and help develop confidence in
    the roles.
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最后但同样重要的是，Sure Step为服务提供商和客户提供了培训价值主张。我们听到许多合作伙伴组织谈论Sure Step如何为他们提供一个为新的咨询资源创建培训/快速入门计划的良好结构。我们都在职业生涯的某个时刻开始过新的工作，我们记得当我们开始新工作时，尽管我们可能对自己是适合这个角色的信心满满，但胃里还是会感到紧张。知道有一个结构化的流程可以遵循，只能减轻最初的紧张感，并有助于在角色中建立信心。
- en: This extends to the customer's organization as well. The customer will have
    any number of **Subject Matter Experts** (**SMEs**) and key users participate
    in the engagement. Some of these resources may have had past experience with deploying
    ERP/CRM solutions, while others may be new to such engagements. Sure Step provides
    these resources a good understanding of the approach, as well as what they could
    expect to contribute to the process in their own roles.
  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这也扩展到了客户的组织。客户将有多位**主题专家**（SMEs）和关键用户参与其中。其中一些资源可能有过部署ERP/CRM解决方案的经验，而其他人可能对这种合作是新手。Sure
    Step为这些资源提供了对方法的理解，以及他们自己角色中可以期望对流程做出什么贡献。
- en: Another benefit from a customer training perspective is the organizational change
    aspect. The introduction of a new business solution can cause unnecessary tension
    and apprehension to the employee's role in the to-be organizational workflows.
    Being able to provide visibility into the new processes can help allay the fears
    in these key resources in the customer organization, and the training can help
    give them confidence in how they would perform their roles in the new system.
  id: totrans-19
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 从客户培训的角度来看，另一个好处是组织变革方面。引入新的商业解决方案可能会给员工在即将到来的组织工作流程中的角色带来不必要的紧张和担忧。能够提供对新流程的可见性可以帮助缓解客户组织中这些关键资源的恐惧，而培训可以帮助他们对自己在新系统中如何履行角色充满信心。
- en: Of course, training is not just for new consulting or customer resources. We
    talked earlier about experienced consultants, each having their own bag of tricks.
    Training them on the Sure Step approach ensures that they each follow a consistent
    process, and that the entire team is on the same page, for the benefit of the
    customer and consulting organizations.

    often overwhelmed. For that matter, given the volume of content, even experienced
