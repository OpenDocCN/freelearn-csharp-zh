<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-68">Managing Requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">Based on what we covered in <em class="italic">Chapters 1</em> and <em class="italic">2</em>, the first steps of software development will direct you to create a software project. When it comes to software projects, the biggest challenge is how to organize them in a way where every single participant will understand what is needed. The best way to do so is to organize its requirements. But more than that, connecting these requirements to a code repository will deliver to everybody a fast and more collaborative view of the project that is being worked on. For years, Microsoft has invested in tools to help us to do this. Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Teams Services are examples. Today, there are two good approaches we can use that we will discuss in this chapter: Azure DevOps and GitHub. Azure DevOps is an evolution of Visual Studio Team Services, and it offers a variety of new features that can help developers document and organize their software. GitHub is well known as an online code repository, but since Microsoft acquired it, a bunch of great tools for application lifecycle management have been integrated into it. For this reason, we can now find many different ways of using GitHub.</p>
<p class="normal">The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Creating a DevOps project using your Azure account</li>
<li class="bulletList">Understanding the functionalities offered by Azure DevOps and GitHub to organize your project</li>
<li class="bulletList">Organizing and managing requirements using Azure DevOps and GitHub</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The first two sections of this chapter summarize all the functionalities offered by these tools, while the remaining sections focus specifically on the tools for documenting requirements and supporting the overall development process. Most of the functionality introduced in the first two sections will be analyzed in more detail in other chapters.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-69">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">This chapter requires you to create a new free Azure account or use an existing one. The <em class="italic">Creating an Azure account</em> section in <em class="italic">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture</em>, explains how to create one.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-70">Introducing Azure DevOps</h1>
<p class="normal">Azure DevOps is a Microsoft <strong class="keyWord">Software-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">SaaS</strong>) platform that enables you to deliver continuous <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>value to your customers. By creating an account there, you will be able to easily plan your project, store your code safely, test it, publish the <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>solution to a staging environment, and then publish the solution to the actual production infrastructure.</p>
<p class="normal">The automation of all the steps involved in software production ensures the continuous enhancement and improvement of an existing solution to adapt it to market needs.</p>
<p class="normal">You can start the process by accessing <a href="https://dev.azure.com">https://dev.azure.com</a>. There, you will be able to sign up using a new account or even sign in using your GitHub account. Once you have access to it, you will be asked to create an organization, as you can see in the following figure.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_01.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.1: Creating an Azure DevOps organization</p>
<p class="normal">After the <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>organization is created, you will be able to create a new project, as we can see in the following screenshot.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_02.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.2: Creating a project using Azure DevOps</p>
<p class="normal">It is important <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>to mention that public projects can be used so long as you comply with the Azure DevOps code of conduct. Once you define the name of the project and its visibility, you will have the project created in seconds.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_03.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.3: Azure DevOps project created</p>
<p class="normal">DevOps itself will be discussed in detail in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding DevOps Principles and CI/CD</em>, but you need to understand it as a philosophy that is focused on delivering value to customers. It is the union of people, processes, and products, where the <strong class="keyWord">Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">CI/CD</strong>) methodology is used to apply <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>continuous improvements to a software application delivered to the production environment. Azure DevOps is a powerful tool whose range of applications encompasses all the steps involved in both the initial development of an application and its subsequent CI/CD process.</p>
<p class="normal">Azure DevOps contains <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>tools for collecting requirements and organizing the whole development process. They can be accessed by clicking the <strong class="screenText">Boards</strong> menu option on the Azure DevOps page.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Interface gráfica do usuário, Aplicativo  Descrição gerada automaticamente" src="img/B19820_03_04.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.4: Azure DevOps Boards menu</p>
<p class="normal">All other functionalities available in Azure DevOps are briefly reviewed in the following subsections. They will be discussed in detail in other chapters. More specifically, DevOps principles and CI/CD are discussed in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding DevOps Principles and CI/CD</em>, and build/test pipelines can be reviewed in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Testing Your Enterprise Application</em>.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-71">Managing system requirements in Azure DevOps</h2>
<p class="normal">Azure DevOps enables you to document system requirements using work items. Work items are <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>stored in your project as chunks of information that can be assigned to a person. They are classified into various types and may contain a measure of the development effort required, a status, and the development stage (iteration) they belong to. Mainly, they are tasks or actions that need to be completed to deliver a product or service.</p>
<p class="normal">DevOps is usually combined with agile methodologies, so Azure DevOps uses iterations, and the whole development process is organized as a set of sprints. The work items available depend on the <em class="italic">work item process</em> you select while creating the Azure DevOps project.</p>
<div><p class="normal">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>check project types in Azure DevOps at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">The following subsections contain a description of the most common work item types that appear when an <strong class="keyWord">Agile</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">Scrum</strong> work item process is selected (the default is <strong class="keyWord">Agile</strong>).</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-72">Epic work items</h3>
<p class="normal">Imagine you are developing a system comprising various subsystems. You are probably not going <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>to conclude the whole system in a single iteration. Therefore, we need an umbrella spanning several iterations to <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>encapsulate all features of each subsystem. Each Epic work item represents one of these umbrellas that can contain several features to be implemented in various development iterations.</p>
<p class="normal">In the Epic work item, you can define the state and acceptance criteria as well as the start date and target date. Besides this, you can also provide a priority and an effort estimate. All this detailed information helps the stakeholders to follow the development process. This is useful as a macro view of the project.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-73">Feature work items</h3>
<p class="normal">All the information that you provide in an Epic work item can also be placed in a Feature work item. So, the difference between these two types of work items is not related to the kind of <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>information they contain but rather to their respective roles and the goals your team aims to accomplish by completing. A feature is a shippable software component. Epics may span several iterations <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>and are hierarchically above Features; that is, each Epic work item is linked to several children features, while each Feature work item is usually implemented in a few sprints and is part of a single Epic work item.</p>
<p class="normal">It is worth mentioning that all work items have sections for team discussions. There, you will be able to find a team member in the discussion area by typing the <code class="inlineCode">@</code> character (as in many forums/social media applications). Inside each work item, you can link and attach various information. You may also check the history of the current work item in a specific section.</p>
<p class="normal">Feature work items are the places to start recording user requirements. For instance, you can write a Feature work item called <strong class="screenText">Access Control</strong> to define the complete functionality needed to implement the system access control.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-74">Product Backlog items/User Story work items</h3>
<p class="normal">Which of these work items is available depends on the working item process selected. There are <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>minor differences between them, but their purpose is essentially the same. They contain detailed <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>requirements for the features, described by the Feature work items they are connected to. More specifically, each Product Backlog/User Story work item specifies the requirements of a single functionality that is part of the behavior described in its parent Feature work item.</p>
<p class="normal">For instance, in a Feature work item for system access control, the maintenance of the users and the login interface should be two different User Story/Product Backlog items. These requirements will guide the creation of other child work items:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tasks</strong>: These are important work items that describe the job that needs to be done to meet the requirements stated in the father Product Backlog items/User Story work item. Task work items can contain time estimates, which help with team capacity management and overall scheduling.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Test cases</strong>: These items describe how to test the functionality described by the requirements.</li>
</ul>
<div><p class="normal">Considering that you will have many work items in a project, visualizing them is not an easy task. For this reason, you may consider <strong class="keyWord">Work Item Visualization </strong>to simplify your view. Check it out at <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.WorkItemVisualization">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.WorkItemVisualization</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">The number <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>of tasks and test <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>cases you will create for each Product Backlog/User Story work item will vary according to the development and testing scenario you use.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-75">Azure DevOps repository</h3>
<p class="normal">There is no software without code, and the code that will be implemented according to a software <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>requirement needs to be placed in a software repository. The <strong class="screenText">Repos</strong> menu item gives you access to a default Git repository where you can place your project’s code:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_05.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.5: Azure DevOps Repos menu</p>
<p class="normal">By clicking the <strong class="screenText">Files</strong> item, you enter the default repository initial page. It is empty and contains instructions on how to connect to this default repository.</p>
<p class="normal">You can add further repositories through the drop-down menu at the top of the page:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_06.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.6: Adding a new repository</p>
<p class="normal">All repositories <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>created are accessible through the same drop-down menu.</p>
<p class="normal">As shown in the preceding screenshot, each repository’s initial page contains the repository address and a button to generate repository-specific credentials, so you can connect to your DevOps repositories with your favorite Git tools. However, you can also connect from inside Visual Studio in a very simple way:</p>
<ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Start Visual Studio and ensure you are logged in to it with the same Microsoft account used to define your DevOps project (or that was used to add you as a team member).</li>
<li class="numberedList">If the <strong class="screenText">Git Changes</strong> window is not open, make it appear by going to the top menu in Visual Studio and selecting <strong class="screenText">View -&gt; Git Changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19820_03_07.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.7: Git Changes window</p>
<ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Click the <strong class="screenText">Create Git Repository</strong>... button in the Git Changes window.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>window that opens, select <strong class="screenText">Existing remote</strong> and insert the URL of the DevOps repository you created. Then, click <strong class="screenText">Create and Push</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19820_03_08.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.8: Connecting to the remote DevOps repository</p>
<p class="normal">Once connected <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>to your DevOps remote repository, the Git Changes window will show several Git commands:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19820_03_09.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.9: Git Changes window</p>
<p class="normal">When you have changes to commit, you can insert a message in the textbox at the top of the window and commit them locally by clicking the <strong class="screenText">Commit All</strong> button, or you can click the dropdown next to this button to access more options:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19820_03_10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.10: Commit options</p>
<p class="normal">You can commit and push or commit and sync, but you can also stage your changes. The three arrows <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>in the top right of the Git Changes window trigger a fetch, pull, and push, respectively. Meanwhile, the dropdown at the top of the window takes care of operations on branches:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface, application, Teams  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19820_03_11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.11: Branch operations</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-76">Package feeds</h3>
<p class="normal">A great way to accelerate software development is by reusing code components that meet the <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>user requirements. These components, in general, are placed into packages. We will discuss this further in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Implementing Code Reusability in C# 12</em>. The <strong class="screenText">Artifacts</strong> menu handles the software packages used or created by the project. There, you can define feeds for basically all types of packages, including NuGet, Node.js, and Python. Private feeds are required since commercial projects also use private packages, so you need a place to put them. Moreover, packages produced during builds are placed in these feeds, so other modules that have them as dependencies can immediately use them.</p>
<p class="normal">Once in <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>the <strong class="screenText">Artifacts</strong> area, you can create several feeds by clicking the <strong class="screenText">+ Create Feed</strong> button, where each feed can handle several kinds of packages, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.12</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.12: Feed creation</p>
<p class="normal">If you select the option to connect to packages from public sources, by default, the feed connects to <code class="inlineCode">npmjs</code>, <code class="inlineCode">nuget.org</code>, <code class="inlineCode">pypi.org</code>, and <code class="inlineCode">Maven</code>. However, you can go to the <strong class="screenText">Search Upstream sources</strong> tab on the <strong class="screenText">Feed</strong> settings page and remove/add package sources. The settings page can be reached by clicking the settings icon in the upper-right corner of the feed page.</p>
<p class="normal">A screenshot <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>of the page of the newly created feed follows:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.13: Feed page</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Connect to Feed</strong> button for each feed shows a window that explains how to connect to the feed for each package type.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.14: Feed connection information</p>
<p class="normal">For NuGet packages, you should add all project feeds to your Visual Studio projects’/solutions’ <code class="inlineCode">nuget.config</code> file so that local machines can also use them; otherwise, your local build will fail.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-77">Test Plans</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Test Plans</strong> section allows you to define the test plans you want to use and their settings. Tests are <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>discussed in detail in <em class="italic">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Testing Your Enterprise Application</em>, but here, we would like to summarize the opportunities offered by Azure DevOps. Test-related operations and settings can be accessed through the <strong class="screenText">Test Plans</strong> menu item.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.15: Test Plans menu</p>
<p class="normal">Here, you may define, execute, and track test plans made up of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Manual acceptance tests</li>
<li class="bulletList">Automatic unit tests</li>
<li class="bulletList">Load tests</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Automatic unit tests must be defined in test projects contained in the Visual Studio solution and based on a framework such as NUnit, xUnit, and MSTest (the .NET SDK has project templates for all of them, so you may find them in Visual Studio). Test Plans gives you the opportunity to execute these tests on Azure and to define the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Several configuration settings</li>
<li class="bulletList">When to execute them</li>
<li class="bulletList">How to track them and where to report their results in the overall project documentation</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">For manual tests, you may define complete instructions for the operator in the project documentation, covering <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>the environment in which to execute them (for example, an operating system) and where to report their results. You can also define how to execute load tests and how to measure the results.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-78">Pipelines</h2>
<p class="normal">Pipelines are automatic action plans that specify all steps from the code build until the software <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>deployment is in production. They can be defined in the <strong class="screenText">Pipelines</strong> area, which is accessible through the <strong class="screenText">Pipelines</strong> menu item:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.16: Pipelines menu</p>
<p class="normal">There, you can define a complete pipeline of tasks to be executed alongside their triggering events, which encompass steps such as code building, launching test plans, and what to do after the tests have passed.</p>
<p class="normal">Typically, after the tests have passed, the application is automatically deployed in a staging area where it can be beta-tested. You can also define the criteria for automatic deployment <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>to production. Such criteria include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The number of days during which the application was beta-tested</li>
<li class="bulletList">The number of bugs found during beta-testing and/or removed by the last code change</li>
<li class="bulletList">Manual approval by one or more managers/team members</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The criteria decision will depend on the way the company wants to manage the product that is being developed. You, as a software architect, must understand that when it comes to moving code to production, the safer, the better.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-79">Usage</h2>
<p class="normal">As you can <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>see from the preceding screenshots, the process for creating an Azure DevOps account is extremely simple. It is worth mentioning that you can start using this fantastic tool at no cost if you have no more than five developers on your team, plus any number of stakeholders. However, it is worth mentioning that there is no limit on the number of users with a stakeholder role.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-80">Introducing GitHub projects</h1>
<p class="normal">Considering all the benefits of Azure DevOps presented, you may now be asking why we need to explore another tool. The reason is simple: GitHub has become, over the years, the main <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>tool for the open-source world. So, we will find many initiatives and projects there that have changed the way we deliver software.</p>
<p class="normal">The main objective of GitHub is to manage code and guarantee that its users can create solutions in a collaborative way. For this, the platform presents features like version control, pull requests, code reviews, issue tracking, and CI/CD.</p>
<p class="normal">However, it would be impossible to design great projects without a platform to support them. That is why we have GitHub projects as an initiative that delivers an adaptable, flexible tool for planning and tracking work on GitHub.</p>
<div><p class="normal">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>find more information about GitHub projects at <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects">https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">It is quite simple to set up a project on GitHub. Once you log in to the platform, you may find projects <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>from your user menu.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.17: Accessing GitHub projects</p>
<p class="normal">There, you will find the option to create a <strong class="screenText">New project</strong>. When you decide to create it, you will find different templates already provided by GitHub.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_18.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.18: Creating a project on GitHub</p>
<p class="normal">The project <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>needs to be linked to a repository. You can do this by accessing the <strong class="screenText">Projects</strong> tab in your repo. There, you can also create a new project.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_19.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.19: Connecting a GitHub repository to a project</p>
<p class="normal">It is worth mentioning that GitHub is more flexible than Azure DevOps, so you will find tools like the ones presented on Azure DevOps, but with different names/definitions. For instance, any task that you will need to define will be called an <strong class="screenText">issue</strong>. Each issue can be placed in a <strong class="screenText">milestone</strong>, which is a good way to define a feature or user story since it will describe <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>an achievement with a date to be finished.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_20.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.20: Setting milestones in a GitHub repository</p>

</div>
<p class="normal">The idea of projects on GitHub is to define useful information for each item that will be used, which is documented in an issue. By default, only <em class="italic">Title</em>, <em class="italic">Assignees</em>, and <em class="italic">Status</em> are required. But you can add labels, linked pull requests, reviewers, repositories, and milestones to them. You can also define custom fields, like <strong class="screenText">Iteration</strong>. For this, you will need to access <strong class="screenText">Project settings</strong>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_21.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.21: Creating custom fields for a GitHub project</p>
<p class="normal">In a GitHub project, you can also set different <strong class="screenText">Views</strong>, such as <strong class="screenText">Table</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Board</strong>, or <strong class="screenText">Roadmap</strong>. The Table view, in particular, offers a quick and efficient method for entering this project-related information, including the custom fields you’ve created, into the project. Once you’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>completed the design phase, you’re ready to create issues for each item planned in your project.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_22.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.22: GitHub project Table view</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Board</strong> view, together with a filter related to iteration, is a perfect way to conduct daily meetings because you will see exactly what is happening to the project.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19820_03_23.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.23: GitHub Board view</p>
<p class="normal">To finish, the <strong class="screenText">Roadmap</strong> view will <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>give you a perspective of the entire project over time.</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.24: GitHub Roadmap view</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, with GitHub projects, you will get almost the same results that we got when using Azure DevOps.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-81">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">This chapter covered how you can create an Azure DevOps or GitHub account for a software development project and how to start managing your projects with Azure DevOps or GitHub projects.</p>
<p class="normal">It also gave a short review of all of Azure DevOps’ functionalities, explaining how to access them through the Azure DevOps main menu.</p>
<p class="normal">To finish, it presented the GitHub project view options to plan and manage a project.</p>
<p class="normal">The chapter also described in more detail how to manage system requirements and how to organize the work necessary with various kinds of work items or issues, along with how to plan and organize sprints that will deliver epic solutions with many features.</p>
<p class="normal">The decision of whether to use Azure DevOps or GitHub in a project will vary according to the expertise of the team and the objective of the project itself. If you are designing an open-source solution, GitHub will definitely be a better option. On the other hand, if you are designing an enterprise solution and need everything to be connected, Azure DevOps is a fantastic tool to do so.</p>
<p class="normal">The next chapter discusses important approaches while writing code.</p>
