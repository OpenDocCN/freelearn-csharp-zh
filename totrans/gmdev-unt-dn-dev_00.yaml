- en: As one of the most widely used game engines in the world, Unity provides easy-to-use
    and powerful game development tools, which undoubtedly attracts many developers
    to choose it to develop their own games. However, the tools needed in modern game
    development are not limited to game engines; other tools and services such as
    the cloud are increasingly used in game development. In this book, we will explore
    how to use the Unity game engine and the Microsoft Game Dev, including the Microsoft
    Azure Cloud and Microsoft Azure PlayFab services, to create games.

- en: Starting by understanding the fundamentals of the Unity game engine, you will
    gradually become familiar with the Unity Editor and the key concepts of writing
    Unity scripts in C#, which will get you ready to make your own game.

    system, animation system, physics system, and how to integrate video and audio
    in your game to make your game more interesting.

- en: As you progress through the chapters, I'll take you through advanced topics,
    such as the math involved in computer graphics, how to create post-processing
    effects in Unity with the new Scriptable Render Pipeline, how to use Unity's C#
    Job System to implement multithreading, and how to use Unity's **Entity Component
    System** (**ECS**) to write game logic code in a data-oriented way to improve
    game performance.

    services, Azure PlayFab, and using the Unity3D PlayFab SDK to access the PlayFab
    API to save and load data from the cloud.

    Concepts in Unity*, continues from the previous chapter and introduces scripting
    in Unity in detail. It begins by introducing the most commonly used classes in
    Unity scripting and then explains the life cycle of scripts. It also covers how
    to create a new script in Unity and attach a script as a component to a GameObject,
    and demonstrates how to add or remove packages through the Unity Package Manager.'
