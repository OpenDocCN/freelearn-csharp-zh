<div><p class="calibre_1">Level Design</p><p class="calibre_2">In this chapter, we'll delve into the process of level design, a huge, nebulous topic that's capable of taking up an entire book in itself. We won't tackle individual tools or focus on a single genre; instead, we aim to provide you with insight into different aspects of the process as well as practical tips on how to best approach creation of content for your game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Strap yourself in; this is an important one, as even the most elegant rules and most polished mechanics can lead to a poor gameplay experience if your level design is not up to scratch!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">What is level design?</p><p class="calibre_2">Level design is the process of creating playable content that serves as a medium of delivering gameplay and storytelling experiences to players. Some games rely on carefully crafted and strictly planned levels/maps/stages/missions. Others leave room for randomization, but still require human input to create puzzles, challenges, enemy spawn rules, pre-assembled level chunks, and even high-level world-building rules.</p><p class="calibre_2">The craft of level design lives on a flexible cross-section between game design, storytelling, and art. Depending on the needs of the project and team structure, a level designer will either take care of the entire level design from start to finish or ask for artistic input from environmental artists, who'll take care of the visual side of things for them. In smaller teams, it's quite common to have a generalist game designer tackle level design tasks.</p><p class="calibre_2">Depending on the game you're working on, the tools you'll use to create levels and missions can vary greatly. For 3D games, you're likely to use either proprietary in-house technology or the standard tools available in engines such as Unity or Unreal (learning the basics of at least one of these two editors is highly recommended). For 2D games, it's more difficult to plan ahead as in-house tools dominate the scene, but, that said, the tools are usually far simpler (by the way, if your game uses 2D tiles and grids, try Tiled—it's an old but very reliable editor that is available for free).</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">The level design process</p><p class="calibre_2">As we already know from the opening paragraphs, level design can span a variety of tasks, from defining enemy spawn patterns to creating puzzles, sculpting, and populating an environment or even defining beat-maps in music games. Nevertheless, there are some processes and steps that can be applied to almost any content creation task, be it in part or as a whole. These steps are as follows:</p><div></div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">The premise: Setting up a high-level vision</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">The sketch: Expanding upon the design</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Grayboxing: Implementing and iterating on gameplay</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Art implementing: Dressing up your creation</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Final polish: Bug fixing and final adjustments before release</li></ol><p class="calibre_2">Let's go through all of them in detail and explore some examples!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">The premise</p><p class="calibre_2">Think of the premise as a succinct but persuasive sales pitch, even if the only person you're selling an idea to is yourself. Usually, all you need is a short paragraph that highlights the purpose (from the designer's point of view) and potentially the value (in the player's eyes) of creating that particular piece of game content. If you have strong references do not be afraid to use them; these can be anything from movie scenes to screenshots of existing games.</p><p class="calibre_2">It's common for the premise to change and evolve multiple times, especially as it's likely to be written down a long time before you actually get down to creating the described content. Nevertheless, it's always good to write down and present your ideas to other people on the team to help you narrow the design down to what's truly important.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember, a premise with too many ideas is usually one that often fails to explore its potential. You're also at risk of confusing your players and creating content that feels bland. If you can't think of a single characteristic that makes your level stand out from the remaining parts of the game, you have just found yourself a good candidate for exclusion. If you have too many good ideas, store them as separate premises; you can always scrap and salvage whatever you can or start anew.</p><p class="calibre_2">The detail and focus of a premise fully depends on your product. In a story-driven game, your premise can reflect on the single most important plot development and the way you plan to achieve the desired result. On the other hand, a match-3 puzzle game can get away with a trivially short premise such as "Introduction to the mechanics of the new Ice Block, easy difficulty, small size, tall but narrow layout".</p><p class="calibre_2">Let’s take a look at a few levels and reverse-engineer the potential premise:</p><p class="calibre_2">Left 4 Dead (Multiplayer FPS) – No Mercy Campaign<br class="calibre1"/> The first campaign in the game is set in New York City, shortly after the viral outbreak. Our survivors are awaiting rescue on the roof of a downtown apartment complex. A helicopter flies by and tells everyone to make their way to the Mercy Hospital to evacuate. The survivors embark on a 4 or 5-part adventure that takes them through the streets of New York, the metro system, and the sewers, culminating in a grand finale on the rooftop of Mercy Hospital.</p><p class="calibre_2">Mario Kart (Super Nintendo, Racing) – Rainbow Road<br class="calibre1"/> Exciting, multi-colored paths in the depths of outer space! Loads of 90 degree turns and a few long straights. Short length and normal grip. Difficulty is added by removing all barriers and putting in Super Thwomps (falling blocks that knock out racers when touched).</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">Remember, there are benefits to writing a premise for nearly anything, from levels and missions to weapons, power-ups, gadgets, character classes, enemy types, puzzles, tutorial sections, and boss fights. Having a plan always beats wandering around blindly, even if you do change it halfway through. Just do not treat your premises too seriously; there’s a chance your creativity will take you away from the chosen path and throw you onto something far better. Embrace it when it happens, but do not count on it!</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">The sketch</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's put your ideas to the test! The purpose of the sketch is to revisit and expand on your plans prior to in-game implementation.</p><p class="calibre_2">For games with complex and time-consuming content creation pipeline (such as console RPGs), you may find this step in the process absolutely necessary. However, in less risky scenarios that do not require massive investments (for example, physics-based puzzle games), you might want to save time and jump straight into the next stage (grayboxing).</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">It is possible that many weeks or even months have passed since you wrote down your initial premise. Catch up with the rest of the team (and especially any other designers) and make sure that the premise still fits with the rest of the game.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Depending on the type of content you're working on, the sketch can contain:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Written design details</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Dialog or a detailed script for storytelling purposes</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Actual sketches, drawings, or scribbles of potential layouts</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Gameplay flow or timeline (list of major events and any branching paths)</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Artistic references (videos, screenshots, and photos)</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Gameplay references (potentially a video of another game)</li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">Why shouldn't I simply start by writing very detailed premises early on and then moving on to execution? The later you are in the project, the better and more cohesive the content you create. If you've just finished production on another game feature or level, there's a chance you have amassed new knowledge and expertise, or perhaps a slew of better ideas that you can put to use. Writing detailed designs for every part of the game's content and following with pure execution is tempting (it makes us feel like everything is planned, under control), but often you'll end up executing an inferior design, just because you got attached to the idea. Games are a product of a dynamic craft, not an assembly line. Be agile! If modifying your premise (even drastically) won't carry a huge price tag, don't be afraid to propose changes. There's no point to sticking to a bad plan just for the sake of it, and you're still early enough that design changes will be cheap.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Let’s take a look at some examples of potential sketches!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Example – written sketch</p><p class="calibre_2">As the first example, I created a written sketch for the Water Temple from The Legend of Zelda:
Ocarina of Time. Not because it's a level design masterpiece, but because it's probably one of the most controversial dungeons in the series.</p><p class="calibre_2">There should be enough detail in the sketch to help brief the team and brainstorm on ideas. You could also start assembling lists of new assets and functionalities for artists and programmers. At the same time, we've left the majority of gameplay exploration to the grayboxing stage. The dungeons in this game are often sets of individual rooms and challenges that come together to fulfill a larger vision.</p><p class="calibre_2">On a side note, I wonder if the makers of the original Ocarina of Time realized how tedious and confusing this dungeon would get—mainly due to the constant backtracking, the chore of equipping/unequipping the Iron Boots and a convoluted, maze-like layout. Some of these problems could certainly be foreseen based on the premise, especially since the hub layout itself is designed to induce backtracking (returning to previously visited locations).</p><p class="calibre_2">And now, without further ado, let's take a look at a written sketch for the Water Temple:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00133.jpg" class="calibre_53"/></p><p class="calibre_2">Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Action-Adventure) - Water Temple</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Premise: A water dungeon with a big, round, water-filled hub with a vertical layout. Players need to visit various wings and use the ocarina to manipulate the water level in the hub (unlocking access to new areas). This will feel like a true maze and test players' navigational and puzzle solving skills.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Backstory: The Water Temple is dedicated to the worship of water spirits and is heavily guarded by Zoras.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Placement and Access: The temple is placed under Lake Hylia. It can only be accessed with the Hookshot and Iron Boots.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Art References: Here, you would typically attach some art you found on the internet. These can be split into the do and don't categories (sometimes showing what you don't want something to look like is very useful). It's very common to have the artists or the art director participate or take care of this process for you.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Size: Large, multi-level.

In the following example, we are dealing with a game that relies on carefully scripted single-player missions. In such cases, writing a high-level timeline of the events is a very useful exercise. The plan is surely going be modified several times during the implementation stage, but at least you'll have a solid starting point:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00069.jpg" class="calibre_54"/></p><p class="calibre_70">The mission has three distinguishable beats.

The bad guy, Imran Zakhaev, is trying to purchase nuclear material gathered from the Chernobyl power plant. An assassination mission was approved by the US to try and stop Zakhaev and the transaction. Price was sent there with his superior, Captain MacMillan.</p><p class="calibre_2">The mission itself is split into two parts that naturally fit together.

It allows you to make great strides on playability and validate the base geometry before investing time dressing it up.</p><p class="calibre_2">The titular gray box refers to the boxy, largely untextured look of levels quickly assembled in 3D editors:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00184.jpg" class="calibre_56"/></p><p class="calibre_70">A grayboxed (blocked out) level for a game in the Uncharted series, as shared by the level designer Michael Barclay (Twitter @MotleyGrue).</p><p class="calibre_2">When entering the grayboxing stage, it's essential to remain flexible, to open your content to new ideas and improvements based on playtesting, feedback, and experimental iterations. This is often the last time to make sweeping design changes, as they can get exponentially more expensive the closer you get to the end of the level design process.</p><p class="calibre_2">Why work on gameplay first? Well, the last thing you want to do is invest large amounts of time and resources into making something artistically pleasing, only to realize it’s not fun to play at all and needs to be completely remodeled.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">No matter how good the artists on your project are, do not count on their pretty textures, visual effects, sounds, and animations to make up for something that isn’t fun in its purest form. You want the art to enhance the game, not mask the shortcomings of its design.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">In regard to gameplay, the grayboxing stage is the best time to:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Validate the base premise and feel of the content</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Verify the geometry/layout/sequence of events</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Set the base difficulty</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Place and configure various gameplay elements such as: <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Enemies, puzzles, pickups, and obstacles</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Triggers, scripts, and any other special gameplay scenarios</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Cutscenes and story elements (possibly in a raw, purely functional form)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Tutorials (again, only to a degree that allows you to validate gameplay)</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">There are times when the content is not designed around gameplay at all, but instead, around a certain artistic masterpiece. For example, a beautiful landscape that showcases the power of your game engine, or an extremely important plot development in a story-driven game. In such situations, you will have to shift your focus towards a different objective, but it's important to acknowledge (and accept) the potentially negative effects on gameplay such a shift can bring. For example, by opting to deliver a huge open vista we may have to remove parts of the geometry and reduce the number of actors in play.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Art implementation</p><p class="calibre_2">With gameplay proved out and validated in the grayboxing stage, art implementation can begin! This includes creating detailed geometry, placing props and decorating the environment, texturing, lighting, and creating special effects and animations.</p><p class="calibre_2">Whether the game designer is directly involved in this part of the process depends on their skill set, the project, and the team. Some highly experienced level designers can handle every single aspect of creating a stage, while others focus solely on gameplay and leave the artistic side to the likes of professional environmental artists.</p><p class="calibre_2">Even if you cannot participate in this step directly, it's important to keep an eye on the process and ensure that essential gameplay elements are getting the correct treatment.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">Production timelines can be tight, and artistic efforts often start as soon as you complete the sketch (or even the premise) of the stage. Concept art, animation, and modeling often run in parallel with grayboxing and gameplay iterations.

This step will often be offset in time and can take place long after all art and gameplay aspects have been implemented, with artists and designers working on something else in the meantime.</p><p class="calibre_2">Why can't we simply finish everything in one go? You can certainly try, but with the passing of time you'll improve your skills and gain new perspective and insight. You'll also be able to compare your creation with the rest of the game and reflect on it as a part of something bigger. You are also likely to get feedback from multiple rounds of external and internal playtesting of the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Extensive iterations and playtesting done during grayboxing will help reduce the number and extent of changes at this stage. If all goes well, final polish will only encapsulate minor tweaks to the geometry, bug fixing, dialogs, rewards, difficulty, and pacing adjustments.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Level design and storytelling</p><p class="calibre_2">As you may remember from the previous chapters, games are a medium for interaction and storytelling. When creating new playable content, you have a variety of tools and opportunities to tell your stories. As we have seen, these stories can emerge from both the overarching narrative and the gameplay experience.</p><p class="calibre_2">Sometimes both stories will be tightly connected. In the detective game L.A Noire, most gameplay actions (such as gathering evidence, interviewing witnesses and so on) are not only motivated and supported by the narrative but also crucial for its development:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00028.jpg" class="calibre_57"/></p><p class="calibre_2">In other cases, gameplay and narrative can be independent entities. In Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords, the orb-matching puzzle gameplay could easily be swapped entirely without affecting the narrative; and on the flip side, the narrative itself does little to influence gameplay:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00188.jpg" class="calibre_58"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords offers a strange (and yet fitting) marriage of match-3 puzzle gameplay with an epic role-playing structure and elaborate storyline.</p><p class="calibre_2">Most games lie somewhere in the middle of this spectrum, with narratives that explain the game world, motivate and justify the player's actions, and at the same time, do not oppose the interactive nature of the gameplay. They allow for player expression within the boundaries of the game world and its rules.</p><p class="calibre_2">Before integrating any storytelling into your level design, you need to ask yourself a range of questions and establish a set of rules that will guide the content creation:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">What's more important, the narrative or gameplay? If it’s the former, will you accept a fragment that isn't fun to play but serves as a good way to deliver your story? If it's the latter, are you ready to sacrifice the narrative for a superior gameplay experience?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Do you use your narrative to explain and reinforce actions of the player, or is your narrative separate from gameplay?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Can the game be played without interacting with the story, or is interaction with the story mandatory to progress?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Is narrative in direct opposition to your game systems? For example, imagine a game in which we play as an FBI agent, and yet we allow (and possibly even reward) hurting innocent civilians.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">With these questions answered, you’ll need to select from a range of tools to convey the narrative.

Gone Home, on the other hand, is a short, story-driven experience built almost entirely around exploration and environmental storytelling, featuring great attention to detail and highly effective (yet subtle) presentation.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Level design practices</p><p class="calibre_2">In the previous sections, we have explained what level design is, and how the process of creating new content can be approached. Now it's time for some practical tips and tricks that should help you with the design process!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Functional level design and realism</p><p class="calibre_2">Game worlds range from highly realistic to completely made-up, and most fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. Worlds do not become more believable because of visual clutter, high-resolution textures, and detailed geometry. They become believable if we can imagine the life that keeps on going when we look away. Even the simplest AI systems can yield surprising results. Humans are naturally prone to connecting strings of random behaviors into larger, more meaningful stories, a phenomenon known as apophenia.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">A simple way to create more coherent designs is to imagine the inhabitants of the world interacting with their surroundings. Don't settle for a set of walls with haphazardly placed furniture that acts like a filler. An office, a house, or a store all have a set purpose and the objects inside them are in there for a reason. A bath doesn’t belong in the living room, and a bed is rarely placed by the front door. If rules from the real world do not suit your creation, then create your own rules and make your fictional world adhere to them.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">On top of making your layouts more immersive, realism can help in making game mechanics more understandable by allowing players to use their own non-game experiences and references. Many physical properties of the real world, such as light, gravity, friction, and buoyancy can take little cognitive effort when translated into fictional worlds.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember, the world you're creating, its inhabitants, and their stories are there to support your gameplay experience, not govern it. Unless you’re working on a simulator, extensive realism can quickly get in the way of the gameplay experience, and become prohibitively expensive to implement. Players do not want a different version of the real world, they want an immersive world that they can understand and care about.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Evolving game features</p><p class="calibre_2">We can apply the philosophy of Kishōtenketsu, a classic storytelling structure often applied to Chinese, Korean, and Japanese narratives.

We'll explore ways in which you can teach your players in <a href="index_split_353.html#filepos796656"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 12</tt></a>, Accessibility.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">The philosophy of Kishōtenketsu been used in games for quite some time, and some of the best recent examples can be found in modern Mario games such as Super Mario Galaxy 2, Super Mario 3D Land, and Super Mario 3D World.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's look at an example! In world 2-4 of Super Mario 3D Land, a new platform is introduced that flips between two positions every time you jump. When the platform is first introduced, there are no consequences for failure (falling down as the platform escapes from under our feet), and players have to learn by doing. Here's the approximation of the layout:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00065.jpg" class="calibre_59"/></p><p class="calibre_2">Remember, the novelty factor alone makes the game more exciting and cognitively stimulating (raising our intensity for that segment); save the challenge for later!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Development</p><p class="calibre_2">Now that the player has been acquainted with the new game element, it's time to introduce a challenge and test their understanding of how the feature works.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's continue our example! As the level develops, so does the challenge. Falling will now result in death and there are obstacles and enemies that get in the way and keep players on their feet:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00039.jpg" class="calibre_60"/></p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Twist</p><p class="calibre_2">After players showcase a sense of mastery, it’s time to confound their expectations. The twist is all about taking what players begin to take for granted, and twisting it in a fresh new way. This is often done by mixing the new mechanic with something that you've introduced previously or by exposing a property that players did not experience or expect. For example, in many Legend of Zelda games, players get a bow and arrow and use it to activate remote switches. Later on, it's unveiled that you set your arrows alight by shooting them over flaming braziers. This twist is all about discovering a new combination of two seemingly unconnected elements, and can be used to present a variety of spatial puzzles.</p><p class="calibre_2">When it comes to our case-study, one of the twist segments pairs our flipping platforms with rotating spike obstacles (introduced in previous worlds):</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00089.jpg" class="calibre_61"/></p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Conclusion</p><p class="calibre_2">This is the final part of our 4 beat story. Players have already acquainted themselves with a new game element, and they've mastered it and seen it being used in novel, unexpected ways. Treat the conclusion like your closing statement; it does not have to be difficult, it has to be satisfying, and provide a sense of achievement, or at least closure. The new element can now either become a staple or be put to rest, ready to come back whenever you wish to provide variety or mix it with something new.</p><p class="calibre_2">The flagpole sequence found at the end of most Super Mario platform levels is a perfect place for the ultimate showcasing of the (now mastered) mechanic. In world 2-4 of Super Mario 3D Land, the flagpole segment asks players to climb a set of flipping platforms if they wish to get a score bonus, a positive ending to the story told by the level design.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Pacing from day one</p><p class="calibre_2">The slow and gradual introduction of game mechanics mentioned above is an example of a pacing exercise. The pace of the game is most often being dictated by the rhythm and intensity of the levels you create. The intensity can stem from both physical and cognitive challenges as well as artistic and emotional stimulation. Novel content and difficult sections raise your intensity while repetitive segments and low difficulty lower it. Prolonged periods of low intensity lead to boredom, while long, overly intense sections can exhaust your players.</p><p class="calibre_2">Tightly controlled singleplayer content (especially if it's story driven) tends to be much harder to revamp once integrated. Therefore, it's important to think of pacing from the very first day, possibly during the sketching period (as illustrated by our example from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare).</p><p class="calibre_2">We’ll cover the complexities of analyzing, planning, and delivering singleplayer and multiplayer pacing at length in <a href="index_split_398.html#filepos890374"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 13</tt></a>, Balancing.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Lock and key</p><p class="calibre_2">Lock and key is a widespread, but somewhat controversial design practice. The basic implementation includes a literal use of a lock and key. You restrict access to a certain area (or reward) until players find the key. To do so, they need to venture elsewhere and complete a set of tasks, advancing the storyline or their character.</p><p class="calibre_2">Turning away your players and asking them to come back later is a form of so-called backtracking. There is value to it but you have to be careful as extensive backtracking and having to manage a list of uncompleted areas can be incredibly frustrating.</p><p class="calibre_2">One obvious use is to prolong your content's lifespan. You may have spent a long time crafting a beautiful set-piece or a highly functional area, and using a lock and a key around it will increase the time spent with your content. Just make sure it's not senseless running around; adding a new obstacle, a fresh wave of enemies, or otherwise twisting the area will help your content feel fresh.</p><p class="calibre_2">Locks and keys can also be used to encourage exploration and make for a less linear experience. Creating a large area and hiding key objects around it allows you to set your players free, while simultaneously ensuring they visit the most important segments and complete all of the necessary tasks.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember that locks and keys do not have to be literal. The level design of games in the Pokemon and Legend of Zelda series is filled to the brim with abstracted locks and keys.</p><p class="calibre_2">In Pokemon, the keys are abilities that have to be unlocked and taught to your creatures. Teach your Pokemon the cut ability and you can now gain access to areas blocked by thick bushes. Needless to say, scouring the map while trying to remember where to apply the newly available key can be a tedious and stressful task for some players.</p><p class="calibre_2">In Legend of Zelda games, there are both actual keys (used to unlock doors, chests and boss rooms) and key items. The latter are usually unlocked in the middle of the dungeon and allow the player to access areas that were previously blocked by a specific puzzle or obstacle. On top of unlocking the rest of the dungeon and granting access to secret areas in the outside world, the key items often come with a secondary use. Some are useful in combat, others can be applied in interesting combinations to solve puzzles.</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00032.jpg" class="calibre_62"/></p><p class="calibre_70">The hookshot is an example of a key item that has a variety of gameplay uses, from puzzle solving to combat.</p><p class="calibre_2">To sum it up, lock and key design is a popular and effective technique, but be careful not to overdo it. Extensive use of backtracking and forcing your players to memorize a list of inaccessible areas is a sure way to make your levels tedious and confusing. Content design that relies solely on pattern matching (use A on B, then X on Y, now rinse, repeat) turns your game into a shopping-list full of memorized responses, rather than a vehicle for true challenge, choice, and expression.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Geometry and gameplay</p><p class="calibre_2">Level geometry (that is, the layout) and the spatial properties of the space you’re creating can have a profound effect on player's emotions, and therefore on gameplay. We’ll explore this subject by first introducing the prospect-refuge theory developed by an English geographer and poet Jay Appleton in his 1975 book The Experience of Landscape.</p><p class="calibre_2">In his work, Appleton presented an enlightening insight into the reasons behind certain landscapes being perceived as beautiful and others as bleak, and why some spaces draw us in and make us feel safe, while others make us uneasy and insecure. According to the prospect-refuge theory, humans like to occupy intimate, sheltered spaces (refuge) that are overlooking vast, open areas full of potential (prospect).</p><p class="calibre_2">Examples of a refuge include:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">An explored cave, cavern, or den</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">The inside of a parked car</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">A bench covered by the protective shade of a tree</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">A walled, wooden lookout tower</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">A house on a hill</li></ul><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00051.jpg" class="calibre_63"/></p><p class="calibre_70">An example of a refuge area in The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim.</p><p class="calibre_2">Examples of a prospect include:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">An open square or park in the middle of a city</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">A slowly descending valley seen from the top</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Islands surrounded by calm water observed from the safety of the harbor</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Softy ascending mountains and hills in the distance</li></ul><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00111.jpg" class="calibre_63"/></p><p class="calibre_70">A vista full of prospect in The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</p><p class="calibre_2">Knowing the basis of prospect-refuge theory allows you to look at the spaces you create from the perspective of an ancient hunter-gatherer that's lying dormant in each and every one of us.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">While making playable spaces, it's up to you to decide what kind of emotions you want to invoke. To satisfy the primal needs of your players, you must protect them from being seen and ambushed, while simultaneously allowing them to peek outside and spot enemies and opportunities alike. On the other hand, if you aim to put your players on edge, make them feel like a sitting duck, visible and exposed from multiple sides. For example, force them to carry a torch or a flashlight while walking down a dark path in the middle of a steep valley, with little visibility, difficult terrain, and lots of opportunities for being ambushed.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Manipulating space</p><p class="calibre_2">The prospect-refuge theory can help us identify the needs, wants, and fears rooted in human psychology. This, in turn, can help us create playable spaces that carry emotional purpose.</p><p class="calibre_2">Depending on the current status of your player and your game mechanics, the physical shape of the world will present different threats and opportunities. Knowing the theme and functionalities of your game, you should be able to identify the potential emotional responses to any type of space. Predict, analyze, and collect that knowledge, making it ready to be applied when designing your levels:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Enclosed Areas: In the context of a survival horror game such as Silent Hill, narrow tunnels and corridors can quickly turn into a claustrophobic nightmare, with enemies able to easily block your movements and pin you down. Moreover, a narrow corridor in a game such as Dark Souls can actually prevent you from effectively using certain spells and weapons (as wall collisions stop your swings). But a tight spot does not have to be a bad one! In Left 4 Dead, unless you're facing one of a few special enemies (whose attacks deal damage in an area of effect), a corridor or a tiny room can force all enemies into a manageable choke point, effectively turning it into a refuge (a safe and desirable space).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Manageable Areas: These are areas that are big enough to move around in yet small enough to easily explore and master. If the space is easy to traverse (both horizontally and vertically) it can be a very comforting one. Especially if players can use its contents and geometry (including walls and corners) to protect themselves (refuge).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Open Areas: An open area can be an inspiring place for the player (a prospect). For a positive effect, provide the player with freedom of movement and mastery over the environment, making the surfaces, approach angles, inhabitants, and weather conditions unthreatening and easy to traverse. Such space can also promote exploration by sparking curiosity about the features of the terrain (caves, valleys, waterfalls) or man-made structures. Memorable features can also provide helpful landmarks and ease navigation. Good visibility and a low threat of being ambushed are also key to making an open space feel safe. On the other hand, you can make an open space feel incredibly threatening and uneasy by reducing the visibility (through fog, rain, darkness), surrounding the player with a terrain that's ripe with ambush opportunities, or making them feel lost in a desolate, hard to traverse world that has no visible landmarks.</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Height</p><p class="calibre_2">Our response to height in games can vary dramatically depending on several factors, including:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Our immediate surroundings (enclosed or exposed, safe or dangerous)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Our ability to traverse in the vertical axis (for example, the power of flight)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">The effects of falling</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Imagine standing at the top of a narrow, metal scaffolding, with no railings, suspended high above the ground. You're not only exposed to being seen but also fully aware that any sudden movement can be incredibly risky and therefore, frightening. In the second scenario, place yourself inside an equally tall church tower. This time, you’re provided with the cover (refuge) of walls and a set of windows from which you can observe (prospect) any incoming threats and opportunities. The simple act of adding or removing barriers to an elevated walkway can have a big impact on how players approach it.</p><p class="calibre_2">If the game allows you to fly freely, opening up the vertical space, the frightening effects of height might be removed entirely. On the other hand, if you're punished severely for a seemingly manageable fall, you'll treat height very, very carefully. The same effect can be induced without having to rely on fall damage and the threat of death. All you'd need to do is, when the fall occurs, force your players to repeat a difficult or time-consuming jump sequence. I am not saying this is a desirable effect, I am simply highlighting how the consequences of and emotional response to height can vary depending on the geometry, our abilities to traverse it, and the potential consequences of falling.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">Even if your game does not rely on player-controlled traversal, it can make great use of height within its mechanics. For example, in many strategy games, a unit that has a height advantage over its foe can be granted a range of attack bonuses (such as increased damage, range, and accuracy).</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Emotional significance of exploration</p><p class="calibre_2">In the context of physical or virtual space, exploration is the act of traversing an area with the purpose of discovering new information or resources. The levels you create as well as the structure of the game itself can allow for different levels of exploration. Great joy and satisfaction can be found in uncovering the lost lands and hidden treasures of the world.</p><p class="calibre_2">To understand how to capitalize on exploration in your levels, you'll need to analyze the internal motivations behind each step of the journey.</p><div></div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Planning: Players project their curiosity onto the game world. They either identify areas of interest ("I want to to go... there!") or specific needs they want to fulfill ("I need to find more mushrooms"). To help in this process, the designer can provide implicit goals (a shrouded area of the map is essentially a big question mark) and explicit goals (a quest to find the magic tree). You can also provide visual points of interest in the world, and encourage resource accumulation by making resources scarce and the progression more difficult or less convenient without them.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Execution: The act of exploration is the act of investment. We put our time and resources on the line, hoping to have our efforts rewarded. It's important to make the players feel like the path they're taking is their own; it's more exciting to be a rogue explorer than a visitor held by a guiding hand. To do that, provide branching paths or open areas that have more than one solution. You may also want to loosen up the structure of the experience (avoid too many scripted cutscenes, turn off automatic path markers, and so on). We want our players to be the authors of their story, even if their every move was predicted and encouraged by the designer.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Pay off: Venturing into the unknown is much more rewarding if there's a potential to be rewarded for our efforts. To avoid disappointing players, try to limit the disparity between the time, effort, and resources put in by the player, and the perceived value of the reward. That said, be careful of making the pay off feel artificially fair and predictable—if each cave is guaranteed to have a loot chest, any sense of exploration wears off the moment you identify a cave. As long as you open up the opportunities for a rare but valuable reward, it's OK to sometimes be a bit disappointing.</li></ol><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Effects of lighting</p><p class="calibre_2">Light and darkness have always exercised powerful effects on our psychology, and as humans we are all predisposed to fear the darkness and the unknowns it presents. However, when it comes to games, the effects of lighting can shift entirely based on the context. The mood of your game, its artistic theme, and the game mechanics can all influence and distort our natural tendencies. Let's explore the various ways of utilizing lighting in the context of level design:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Helping with navigation: Lights not only illuminate dark environments, they can be used to immediately grab our attention. A natural reaction for any human is to seek the warmth and shelter of light. The stronger the contrast, the stronger the effect. This survival trait has been utilized to great extent in Left 4 Dead, where bright lights coming from cars, floodlights, and street lamps are strung together to form a visual path to safety. When players are lost and swarmed by hordes of enemies, they are highly reliant on strong and immediate navigational clues provided by strong lights. This rule works both ways. You should avoid extensively illuminating areas you do not wish your players to pay attention to!</li></ul><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00197.jpg" class="calibre_64"/></p><p class="calibre_70">A path of light is guiding the players in Valve's Left 4 Dead</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Light is a commodity: Fuel for portable lighting sources such as torches, flashlights, and night vision goggles can be turned into a valuable commodity and create a cycle of reassurance (when the light is going strong) and fear (when we run out of fuel). Should an area be completely shrouded in darkness, players will be forced to find a way to illuminate it. This results in a very natural and self-explanatory case of lock and key progression gating.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Using light for combat: Many games limit and enforce the use of light sources, but few make them as important as Alan Wake, where lights play a paramount role in combat. Shining your flashlight at an enemy will gradually destroy their shield of darkness, making them vulnerable to your weapons. You simply cannot fight back unless you use a source of light! Strong floodlights are also spread across the levels, not only guiding the players but also acting as safe zones.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Curious shades: While darkness can be very frightening, shade is much more approachable. Yes, it may obscure some threats, but with a comfortable level of visibility remaining, we can navigate through shaded areas with ease. If players feel adequately equipped and ready for an adventure, a shaded, seemingly hidden and unexplored space is sure to spark curiosity...If an area isn't occupied, then who knows, maybe there's something of value still to be discovered? Shaded areas are also synonymous with refuge spaces, offering protection from being seen by anyone outside while allowing one to see incoming threats.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Darkness as a friend: In many games that put emphasis on stealth, even absolute darkness can be your best friend. In series such as Metal Gear Solid, Thief, and Splinter Cell, standing in the light is synonymous with being utterly vulnerable and exposed. In the context of these game worlds, the veil of darkness provides near-absolute safety in an otherwise hostile environment. But a game does not have to be focused on stealth mechanics to utilize darkness as a safe space; a great example is a first-person shooter from 2002 called The Darkness (uh, we are getting quite literal here). In The Darkness, the playable character is imbued with special powers that do not work in well-lit areas, turning light into a threat that has to be avoided or dealt with. Level design in such games often puts more emphasis on the use and placement of light and shade as opposed to the actual geometry.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Based on the examples above, we know that imbuing light and shade with gameplay roles defines what a refuge space is for your players. With that knowledge, one can create levels with carefully spaced out refuge spaces that encourage players to plan a path (from refuge, through the prospect space, and back into refuge). If you provide your players with a degree of freedom (multiple refuge spaces to consider) they're sure to start building mental paths between various parts of the space, making them feel more empowered and tactical about the way they approach the environment.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">The effects of using light are often proportional to the level of contrast. If the entire scene has the same level of brightness, nothing can benefit from being particularly pronounced or obscured. A screen filled with bright light does not have as strong an effect as a beaming light at the end of a dark tunnel.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Vision as a mechanic</p><p class="calibre_2">Light and darkness are not limited to the environmental aesthetic. Vision can be an important part of your game rules, used to create and influence the information horizon: that is, how much players know about the state of the game world and its participants.</p><p class="calibre_2">With mechanics such as fog of war (a staple found in many top-down strategy games), you can reward and encourage exploration, and put an entirely different spin on light and darkness.</p><p class="calibre_2">In games that utilize this mechanic, any area on the map that hasn't been explored is either:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Completely blank: With black patches on the map</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Heavily dimmed: Showcasing the topography, but indicating the player can't see what's going on in that part of the level</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Regardless of the initial level of visibility, you have to decide what's going to happen after initial exploration. Two most common examples are:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Permanently removing fog of war from any area that has been visited</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Only dispersing fog of war from areas that are currently under player's control, or close to a friendly unit or building:</li></ul><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00146.jpg" class="calibre_65"/></p><p class="calibre_70">The two states of fog of war in Age of Empires.</p><p class="calibre_2">This may seem like a trivial, low-level choice, but it can have profound effects on gameplay. By removing fog of war after exploration, you permanently empower the player with new information. This promotes players to venture far, and quickly.</p><p class="calibre_2">On the other hand, reapplying fog of war to uninhabited areas maintains a level of exciting uncertainty. It requires players to anticipate the moves of their foes, rather than to simply react to them. Vision becomes a form of commodity, an extension of any other map control mechanic you may have. It also opens up the possibilities of your level topography. If a unit is positioned above the enemy, it might be able to see and engage the enemy without the risk of effective retaliation.</p><p class="calibre_2">If you plan on using fog of war or any other vision-oriented mechanic in your game, think of its role and how it may affect player behavior. Are you adding these mechanics because other similar games have it? Or is the added uncertainty and sense of exploration a necessary aspect of your gameplay? Do your vision mechanics reinforce the behaviors you want your players to express, or are they simply slowing down your gameplay?</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">When working with vision mechanics, be sure to implement (or ask for) a range of parameters that might help you experiment with vision in your game. Examples include multiplying vision radius, persisting vision for a moment after leaving the location, removing fog of war completely, or making it disperse after initial exploration. You might have a standard you think you’re set to follow, but your game might feel much more fun with a certain combination that you can’t foresee.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Level design in multiplayer action games</p><p class="calibre_2">Multiplayer level design is a huge subject of its own and each game has its individual dynamic. It's also a prime candidate for extensive playtesting and user research! For the sake of this book, I combined a set of tips that can be applied to most action games and help you design better maps:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Follow a premise: A great way to make your level stand out from the rest of your game is to build it around a unique gameplay premise or a visual set piece (waterfall, windmill, or even a crashed spaceship). Use the geometry, lighting, wall signs, and game objectives to guide the players towards a distinguishable space that defines the level. A strong premise also allows you to stay focused and prioritize parts of the level against one another.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Avoid dead-ends: They stop players in their tracks and disrupt their flow, making them feel lost and foolish for not knowing where to go.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Provide flanking opportunities: Even the most desirable vantage position need some weaknesses.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Keep your players moving: Rewarding risk-taking by hiding powerful items in areas that are densely populated or tough to access is a classic play, but not the only one! You could even keep your players moving by re-balancing or spreading out ammo pickups and lowering the initial ammo capacity.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Use heatmaps: Ask for implementation of death location analytics as early as possible. This will allow you to log the positions of each player death and then transpose them onto the map layout, highlighting areas that are highly popular and ones that see little action. It's okay to have zones that are very hot, as long as they’re not confined to a single door frame. However, if half of your map is not seeing any action, you may consider changing the geometry or providing additional incentives (such as pick-ups and weapons) for players that venture out there.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Think vertically: We often look at maps from the top, leading us to forget how big a role height plays. Just make sure to provide several ways to traverse between different levels of heights, seeing an enemy above and not knowing how to reach their position can be incredibly frustrating:</li></ul><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00046.jpg" class="calibre_66"/></p><p class="calibre_70">The 2Fort map in Team Fortress 2 is a great example of a strong premise (two forts separated by a river) and vertical design (the stage has elevated sniping platforms as well as underground sections accessible from the river).</p><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">The screenshots used in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only.

Many pages later, and in spite of the overwhelming complexity of the subject, you hopefully feel more confident about approaching the creation of levels for your games.</p><p class="calibre_2">We started by describing the 5 step approach to level design (from premise to polish), and explored the interactions between level design and storytelling. We then took a journey through a set of practical tips and tricks, from the use of realism and the philosophy of Kishōtenketsu (intro, development, twist, conclusion) to the complexities of light and darkness, practical use of space, and tips on multiplayer level design.</p><p class="calibre_2">But that's not all! The subject of pacing (a concept briefly mentioned during our example sketch for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare) will be expanded upon in <a href="index_split_398.html#filepos890374"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 13</tt></a>, Balancing.</p><p class="calibre_2">Now that we have our game worlds, we should try and populate them. The next chapter is dedicated to the art and craft of creating game characters.</p><div></body></html>
