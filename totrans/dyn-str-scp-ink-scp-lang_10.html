			<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to use the ink Unity API to work with variables and functions. Any variables or functions defined in ink can be accessed from any point in its code. The API provided by the ink-Unity Integration plugin provides an interface through its <code>variablesState</code> property to access any defined variables. This is also true of a method provided by the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> API, which can access any functions defined in the ink code. Understanding this functionality is key to creating more complex projects by using the ink-Unity Integration plugin as a bridge between an ink story and Unity code.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Changing ink variables outside a story</li>
				<li>Calling ink functions externally</li>
				<li>Controlling a story through variables and functions</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>The examples used in this chapter, in the <code>*.cs</code> and <code>*.ink</code> files, can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Dynamic-Story-Scripting-with-the-ink-Scripting-Language/tree/main/Chapter8">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Dynamic-Story-Scripting-with-the-ink-Scripting-Language/tree/main/Chapter8</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Changing ink variables outside a story</h1>
			<p><code>VAR</code> keyword and an initial value. Throughout a story, the value of a variable can be changed. By comparing their values, variables can also influence the flow of a story.</p>
			<p>Variables are <em class="italic">global</em> in ink. Once created, they can be accessed by any other part of the code within the same story. This functionality is also carried over into a named property as part of the ink-Unity Integration plugin, called <code>variablesState</code>. Every variable defined in an Ink story can be accessed by using its name.</p>
			<p>In this topic, we will examine how to use this property to access and change values in a running ink story. We will begin by looking at how to use the <code>variablesState</code> property and comparing values in ink to control its flow outside the story.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Accessing ink variables</h2>
			<p>The Story API in<a id="_idIndexMarker328"/> Unity provides access to ink variables. In this section, we will explore the <code>variablesState</code> property and how to access an ink variable by its name. Perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Start by creating a new project in Unity based on the 2D built-in template. </li>
				<li>Import the ink-Unity Integration plugin.</li>
				<li>Add a new ink file and rename it <code>InkVariables.ink</code>. <p>The file that is created will hold the ink source code. Because the ink-Unity Integration plugin runs compiled ink stories, the source code for a story must exist before the API can be used to access and run its contents:</p><div><img src="img/Figure_8.1_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 8.1 – The project window showing the InkVariables.ink file&#13;&#10;" width="358" height="183"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.1 – The project window showing the InkVariables.ink file</p></li>
				<li>Open the <code>InkVariables.ink</code> file for editing in Inky.</li>
				<li>Change<a id="_idIndexMarker329"/> the contents to the <code>Example 1 (InkVariables.ink)</code> file. </li>
				<li>Save the file and return to Unity.<p class="callout-heading">Reminder</p><p class="callout">The automatic recompilation of ink source files can be changed by visiting the <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> window. You can do this by clicking on <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> and then <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong>. Clicking on <strong class="bold">Ink</strong> and then changing the <strong class="bold">Compile All Ink Automatically</strong> setting allows you to update this value. If enabled, the plugin will automatically create a JSON file.</p></li>
				<li>Create a new, empty game object and name it <code>InkStory</code>.</li>
				<li>Create a new <code>Script</code> component in the <code>InkStory</code> game object and name the new C# file <code>InkStoryScript.cs</code>.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>InkStoryScript.cs</code> file for editing in Visual Studio.</li>
				<li>Update the <code>InkStoryScript.cs</code> file to <code>Example</code> <code>1</code> <code>(InkStoryScript.cs)</code>.<p>The updated code uses the <code>GetVariableWithName()</code> method as part of the <code>VariablesState</code> object. The <code>variablesState</code> property is used with the name of the variable in ink, <code>number_example</code>, as part of the <code>GetVariableWithName()</code> method. Additionally, the <code>Debug.Log()</code> method is used to display the value of the variable in the <strong class="bold">Console</strong> window when run in Unity.</p></li>
				<li>Associate the file with the code. You can do this using either the <code>Ink JSON File</code> property inside the <code>Script</code> component.</li>
				<li>Run the project in Unity.<p>Once the project starts running, open the <strong class="bold">Console</strong> window. A new message will have <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>been added:</p><div><img src="img/Figure_8.2_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 8.2 – The console window showing the value of the ink variable &#13;&#10;" width="403" height="148"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.2 – The console window showing the value of the ink variable </p></li>
				<li>Stop the running project in Unity.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If variables are defined before the first text content in ink, they are also loaded <em class="italic">before</em> the content. In <em class="italic">Example 1</em>, as is evident from <em class="italic">Step 8</em>, the initial values of the variables can be accessed immediately after loading an ink story. The functionality for accessing variables is separate from the functionality of loading and displaying text content.</p>
			<p>Any ink variable that is able to be accessed can also be changed. In the next section, we will discover how this functionality is key to using the <code>variablesState</code> property, as part of the Ink API, and how it allows you to create more complex projects in Unity when using the ink-Unity Integration plugin.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Changing the value of the ink variables</h2>
			<p>The English <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>word "variable" means <em class="italic">able to be changed</em>. All ink variables, once created, can be changed at any point. The <code>variablesState</code> property follows the same pattern. If a variable can be accessed, its value can be changed.</p>
			<p>The <code>VariablesState</code> class contains multiple methods in which to access and change the values of the variables within an ink story. However, it also contains a shorthand access operator using square brackets and the name of the variable in quotation marks. Often, this shorthand is used rather than directly using method names to change the values of variables within the <code>variablesState</code> property.</p>
			<p>Now, return to the project that we used as part of the <em class="italic">Accessing Ink variables</em> section. Perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>InkStoryScript.cs</code> file for editing in Visual Studio.</li>
				<li>Change the existing code to <code>Example 2 (InkStoryScript.cs)</code>. </li>
				<li>Save the<a id="_idIndexMarker332"/> file and return to Unity.</li>
				<li>Run the project.<p>The <code>variablesState</code> property. Any changes to these values are reflected in the next use of the <code>Continue()</code> or <code>ContinueMaximally()</code> methods.</p></li>
				<li>Stop the running project in Unity.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Variables are not the only values that can be accessed from outside an ink story. The ink-Unity Integration plugin also adds the ability to call functions in ink from Unity. While accessing and changing the values of variables can be helpful, directly calling functions in ink and passing them values from Unity is often the preferred way in which to approach the exchange of data between Unity and ink. In the next section, we will review why using functions is frequently the better option for complex data or for when you want to<a id="_idIndexMarker333"/> process multiple values as part of the same task in ink.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Calling ink functions externally</h1>
			<p>As with <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>variables, functions are also global in ink. This means they can be accessed as part of any ink code that is part of the same story. As part of the Unity API provided by the <code>Story</code> class, the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method calls a function in the ink code based on the name passed to it. Because functions in ink are global, they can be called from outside the story itself. However, unlike working with the <code>variablesState</code> property and only accessing a single value, multiple values can be passed to an ink function at one time. Additionally, the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method can be configured to return the text output within the ink function or any returning data, too.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will begin by testing whether an ink function exists using the <code>HasFunction()</code> method. Next, we will examine how the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method is the preferred option for complex data or multiple data values when communicating between Unity and ink. Finally, we will review examples of how to use the text result and return data from an ink function within Unity code.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Verifying and evaluating ink functions</h2>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>working <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>with functions in ink, the <code>HasFunction()</code> method verifies whether an ink function exists. Note that it should always be used before working with an ink function to prevent any issues:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new project in Unity based on the built-in 2D template.</li>
				<li>Import the ink-Unity Integration plugin.</li>
				<li>Create a new, empty game object named <code>InkStory</code>.</li>
				<li>Add a <code>Script</code> component to the <code>InkStory</code> game object and name the ink file <code>InkStoryFunctions.cs</code>.</li>
				<li>Add a new ink file and rename it <code>InkFunctions.ink</code>.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>InkFunctions.ink</code> file in Inky and change its contents to <code>Example 4 (InkFunctions.ink)</code>.</li>
				<li>Open <code>InkStoryFunctions.cs</code> for editing in Visual Studio.</li>
				<li>Update the <code>InkStoryFunctions.cs</code> file to <code>Example 4 (InkStoryFunctions.cs)</code>.</li>
				<li>Save the <code>InkStoryFunctions.cs</code> file.</li>
				<li>In Unity, associate<a id="_idIndexMarker337"/> the compiled JSON file for the <code>InkFunctions.ink</code> file <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>with the <code>Ink JSON File</code> property, as part of the <code>Script</code> component of the <code>InkStory</code> game object.</li>
				<li>Run the project.<p>In the <code>relationship</code> ink variable has been changed as a result of calling two methods, <code>HasFunction()</code> and <code>EvaluateFunction()</code>. The <code>HasFunction()</code> method of the <code>Story</code> class returns a Boolean value. It also guarantees that a function exists before it is used. </p></li>
				<li>Stop the project.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After verifying that a function exists, it can be evaluated. The code in the <code>InkStoryFunctions.cs</code> file uses two methods: <code>HasFunction()</code> and <code>EvaluateFunction()</code>. Within the ink API, the term <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method.</p>
			<p>When using the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method, the first parameter is the name of the function in ink. Any additional parameters are passed to the ink function directly. In the code that is used as part of the <code>InkStoryFunctions.cs</code> file, the use of the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method includes two parameters: the name of the <code>increase()</code> ink function and the amount of value to increase inside ink.</p>
			<p>This use of an ink function that has been called from Unity to change values is a very common pattern when using the ink-Unity Integration plugin. In this case, the <code>increase()</code> function in ink updates the <code>relationship</code> value inside ink. This allows ink values to be adjusted by ink functions. When working in Unity, values can be passed to ink to perform multiple tasks, depending on the ink functions defined for those tasks, without extra code on the Unity side.</p>
			<p>ink functions are special sections of a story. This means they can also produce text output along with other code-related actions. However, to gain access to the text output of an<a id="_idIndexMarker339"/> ink<a id="_idIndexMarker340"/> function using the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method, a special keyword is needed in C#: <code>out</code>. We will learn more about this keyword in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Retrieving the ink function text output</h2>
			<p>The C# programming<a id="_idIndexMarker341"/> language allows you to define a variable and then pass it to a method. Internal to the method, it is expected that the value of the variable will change. Note that this will not be a change to the value passed to the method, but to the value contained within the variable itself. More generally, in programming, this is known as passing by reference. Instead of passing some data to a method, a reference (that is, where to find the variable to store the value) is passed instead.</p>
			<p>In C#, the <code>out</code> keyword can be used with a parameter to a method to specify that the variable, and not its value, should be passed by reference. This means that when the method is finished with its actions, the value within a variable that was passed to the method will change as a result. In C#, using the <code>out</code> keyword allows a developer to specify they want a value <em class="italic">out</em> of the method and into a specific variable.</p>
			<p>When working with the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method provided by the ink-Unity Integration plugin, if the second parameter uses the <code>out</code> keyword, the method knows to take any text produced during the evaluation and pass it <em class="italic">out</em> of the method back to the variable. Perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Return to the code used in the <em class="italic">Verifying and evaluating ink functions</em> section.</li>
				<li>Update the code in the <code>InkStoryFunctions.cs</code> file to <code>Example 5 (InkStoryFunctions.cs)</code>.</li>
				<li>Save the changed <code>InkStoryFunctions.cs</code> file.</li>
				<li>Return to Unity.</li>
				<li>Play the project.</li>
				<li>Stop the project.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Using the <code>out</code> keyword with the <code>functionOut</code> variable as a parameter to the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method lets C# know to pass any text <em class="italic">out</em> of the method. Because the <code>relationship</code> value was updated internally in ink by calling the <code>increase()</code> function<a id="_idIndexMarker342"/> from Unity to ink, its value is shown as <code>51</code> in the <code>functionOut</code> variable in C# is given the text <em class="italic">out</em> of the use of the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method. This allows it to then pass its value to the <code>Debug.Log()</code> method and, ultimately, show the updated value in the <strong class="bold">Console</strong> window.</p>
			<p>When the <code>out</code> keyword is used with the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method in this way, any text output from a function can be captured and passed back from ink to Unity. Combined with creating ink functions to update ink values, this additional change to the pattern shown in the <em class="italic">Verifying and evaluating ink functions</em> section allows you to call ink functions to perform ink-related tasks. This allows for the separation between ink concerns and those in Unity.</p>
			<p>Within ink, a story can be controlled by different values. Using conditional options and a selective output, the text of a choice can be displayed or a diversion followed. Because the values of variables can be directly accessed using the <code>variablesState</code> property and functions that have been called using the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method, this means an ink story can be controlled from Unity. In the next section, we will learn how to connect user interface elements in Unity with ink variables and functions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Controlling a story through variables and functions</h1>
			<p>The <code>variablesState</code> property<a id="_idIndexMarker343"/> and the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method<a id="_idIndexMarker344"/> give the developer two ways in which to access values within an ink story. By using these two approaches, a story can be <em class="italic">controlled</em> by more than just the options that are presented to a player. User interface elements within Unity can be attached to methods that can then change ink values.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will connect ink to Unity. By using the <code>variablesState</code> property and the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method, we will review a code pattern where Unity provides the user interface and communicates with ink functions to adjust and react to values during runtime.</p>
			<p>Across the three sections of this topic, first, we will prepare a Unity project by creating the necessary game objects. Next, we will add the code to control the user interface. Finally, we will adjust the presentation of the user interface and run the project.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Preparing a user interface</h2>
			<p>To begin work <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>with Unity buttons, a new project is required. For simplicity, a 2D project is recommended. This will allow you to work easily with an interface without needing to worry about perspective. Perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a new project in Unity using the built-in 2D template and name this project <code>Shopping Trip</code>.</li>
				<li>Import the ink-Unity Integration plugin.</li>
				<li>Create a new, empty game object named <code>InkStory</code>.</li>
				<li>Create a new <code>Script</code> component inside the <code>InkStory</code> game object. Name the created C# file <code>InkStoryShopping.cs</code>.</li>
				<li>Create a new ink file named <code>InkShopping.ink</code>.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>InkShopping.ink</code> file for editing in Inky and change its contents to <code>Example 6 (InkShopping.ink)</code>.<p>In Unity, create a new <code>Button</code> game object. Select the automatically created <code>Canvas</code> game object in Unity and create a second <code>Button</code> game object so that both buttons are the children of the <code>Canvas</code> game object:</p><div><img src="img/Figure_8.4_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 8.4 – The created buttons in Unity&#13;&#10;" width="348" height="259"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.4 – The created buttons in Unity</p></li>
				<li>Select the <code>Canvas</code> game object again and create a <code>Text</code> game object. Both buttons, along<a id="_idIndexMarker346"/> with the newly created <code>Text</code> game object, should all be children of the <code>Canvas</code> game object.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The ink file created as part of <em class="italic">Step 6</em> established the ink functions that will be called from future Unity code. The two buttons will serve as an interface for the buying and selling of an inventory that is also tracked by the ink code. In the next section, we will move from having set up everything to writing the Unity code to create a bridge between the interface and ink. This will track two values: <code>money</code> and <code>inventory</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Scripting user interface objects</h2>
			<p>In the previous <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>section, we worked through the steps that were needed to create a new Unity 2D project and to create the necessary game objects. In this section, we will learn how to connect user actions (that is, clicking) with the user interface by adding code on the Unity side. Then, we will use the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method in Unity to communicate with ink functions within a running story to control its progression:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>InkStoryShopping.cs</code> file for editing in Visual Studio. </li>
				<li>Change its content to <code>Example 6 (InkStoryShopping.cs)</code>.<p>In the new code, three new methods have been added to the Unity code. We have directly mapped the Unity methods to ink functions. For example, the name of the <code>Sell()</code> method in Unity almost matches the <code>sell()</code> name of the ink function. The differences in capitalization are only because of the recommended capitalization usage in each programming context.</p></li>
				<li>Associate the compiled ink JSON file with the new public property. Associate the <code>Text</code> game <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>object with the <code>Text Status</code> property:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.5_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 8.5 – Associating the Text GameObject with the Text Status property&#13;&#10;" width="696" height="235"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.5 – Associating the Text GameObject with the Text Status property</p><p class="callout-heading">Recommendation</p><p class="callout">Because the two existing <code>Button</code> game objects have children <code>Text</code> game objects, it is recommended that you use the drag-and-drop approach to associate a game object with a property. This will prevent any issues with associating the wrong <code>Text</code> game object.</p></li>
				<li>Select the <code>Canvas</code> game object in Unity in the <code>Horizontal Layout Group</code> component.</li>
				<li>Change the <code>Horizontal Layout Group</code> component from the default value of <code>Horizontal Layout Group</code> component adds a layout structure<a id="_idIndexMarker349"/> to the <code>Canvas</code> game object. The adjustment of the <strong class="bold">Child Alignment</strong> property changes the starting position of all its children to the absolute-center positions of the available screen space.</p></li>
				<li>Select the first <code>Button</code> game object of the children game objects of the <code>Canvas</code> game object, in the <code>Button</code> game object can have one or more listener functions associated with its <code>OnClick</code> user event. When a user clicks on the <code>Button</code> game object, these functions will be called in the order in which they appear in the list.</p><p>Because <code>Button</code> is a <code>GameObject</code>, it can only communicate with other game objects. This is an important aspect of how Unity understands the differences between game objects and their components. A <code>GameObject</code> is a <em class="italic">container</em> for other components, including any <code>script</code> components. This means that to connect the <code>OnClick</code> user event for a <code>Button</code> game object to some code found in a <code>script</code> component, the <code>GameObject</code> that the <code>script</code> component is associated with must be used. For us, this means the <code>InkStory</code> game object.</p></li>
				<li>Associate the <code>InkStory</code> game object with the <code>On Click ()</code> component of the first <code>Button</code> game object. This can be done by dragging and dropping the <code>InkStory</code> game <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>object onto the property:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.8_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 8.8 – Associating the InkStory GameObject with the On Click () component&#13;&#10;" width="669" height="156"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.8 – Associating the InkStory GameObject with the On Click () component</p><p>Once a <code>GameObject</code> has been associated with an entry in the <code>On Click ()</code> component listing, the <strong class="bold">No Function</strong> drop-down menu will be enabled. Upon this association, Unity will have processed the game object and looked for every possible method or function that might be used.</p></li>
				<li>Using the <code>InkStoryShopping.Buy</code>.</p></li>
				<li>Select the second <code>Button</code> game object of the children of the <code>Canvas game object</code>, in the <code>On Click ()</code> component.</li>
				<li>Follow <em class="italic">Step 7</em> and <em class="italic">Step 8</em> to associate the <code>InkStory</code> game object with the <code>On Click</code> <code>()</code> component. For <em class="italic">Step 8</em>, instead of using the <code>Buy</code> <code>()</code> method, select the <code>Sell</code> <code>()</code> method:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.9_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 8.9 – Associating the InkStoryShopping.Sell() method&#13;&#10;" width="588" height="139"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.9 – Associating the InkStoryShopping.Sell() method</p>
			<p>At the end of <em class="italic">Step 10</em>, the first <code>Button</code> game object is associated with the <code>Buy()</code> method, and the second is associated with the <code>Sell()</code> method. Internally, those methods are communicating with their corresponding ink functions. As you<a id="_idIndexMarker351"/> will discover shortly, clicking on the buttons will call Unity methods, which, in turn, will call ink functions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Adjusting the presentation values</h2>
			<p>In this final <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>section, we will change the default values of the user interface game objects created in the previous section. Adjusting these values will help us to better understand the relationship between game objects and improve the experience of interacting with the onscreen buttons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the first <code>Button</code> game object in the <code>Text</code> game object.</li>
				<li>Change the <code>Text</code> property value from its default setting of <code>Button</code> to <code>Buy</code>:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.10_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 8.10 – Changing the Text property&#13;&#10;" width="390" height="232"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.10 – Changing the Text property</p></li>

				<li>Select the third child game object of the <code>Canvas</code> game object, that is, the <code>Text</code> game object. Be sure not to select the previous two <code>Text</code> game objects that were<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> updated in the previous steps.</li>
				<li>Change the width and height of the <code>Text</code> game object to <code>400</code> and <code>250</code>:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.11_B17597.jpg" alt="Figure 8.11 – Adjusting the width and height of the Text game object&#13;&#10;" width="533" height="260"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.11 – Adjusting the width and height of the Text game object</p></li>

				<li>Play the project.<p>When played, the far-left side will show the updated status of the <code>money</code> and <code>inventory</code> variables in ink. Clicking on the buttons will call the Unity methods, which, in turn, will evaluate the ink functions and change the values inside the running ink story. This is a complete example of how to <em class="italic">control</em> an ink story through variables and functions.</p></li>
				<li>Stop the project.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>While multiple steps <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>were involved to create the user interface elements and change the values of their properties, the code is relatively simple. Functions were created in ink to adjust the ink values. In Unity, methods were created matching the names of the ink functions. </p>
			<p>This section demonstrated how a simple shopping scene could be created in ink and manipulated from Unity. By knowing the name of the ink functions, C# methods in Unity can evaluate them to either adjust values or, in the case of the <code>status()</code> ink function, retrieve the text output. This was also a demonstration of how to separate user interface programming from story-related code. They communicated with each other, but they were written in different contexts.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will examine a different approach to working with variables and functions in a story while continuing the trend of separating our narrative and game code. However, instead of clicking on buttons in Unity to trigger functions in ink, we will explore the reverse. Events will happen in ink and trigger changes in Unity. This chapter focused on how to control ink from Unity. The next chapter will demonstrate how to control parts of Unity from events happening within a running ink story.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we began by demonstrating how the <code>variablesState</code> property exposes all of the variables in ink. We started by using the <code>GetVariableWithName()</code> method to access variables by name and the provided shorthand syntax of using square brackets. For completeness, the <code>variablesState</code> property was explained. However, in most situations, ink functions should change ink values. This helps to keep any code working with those values existing within the ink story and is easier to maintain over time, and we closed the chapter on this same theme. Additionally, we explored how buttons in Unity can call their methods and then call ink functions. By using the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method, we can access the ink function in Unity to either pass data into the project or retrieve possible text output with the <code>out</code> keyword in C#.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B17597_09_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor137"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Story API – Observing and Reacting to Story Events</em>, we will emphasize the ink-Unity Integration plugin and its API by inspecting a different approach to the relationship between Unity and ink. Instead of using Unity methods to call ink functions, we will examine some patterns to control parts of Unity from ink. Instead of having to click on buttons in Unity to change values, ink will cause changes that will then register in Unity. For projects requiring more real-time feedback from ink, these patterns will be a preferred approach to those shown in this chapter using the <code>variablesState</code> property and the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method.</p>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">Are variables global in ink?</li>
				<li>What effect does functions being global mean regarding how they are accessed in ink?</li>
				<li>Do the <code>Continue()</code> and <code>ContinueMaximally()</code> methods affect the values of variables in ink?</li>
				<li>What shorthand syntax does the <code>VariablesState</code> class provide to access variables based on their names?</li>
				<li>Should the name of an ink function be used to test whether it exists before you attempt to access it?</li>
				<li>How is the <code>out</code> C# keyword used with the <code>EvaluateFunction()</code> method as part of the Story API when working with the ink-Unity Integration plugin?</li>
