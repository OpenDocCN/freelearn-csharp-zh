        <p>Writing modern Enterprise software requires large teams that need close co-ordination to&#160;deliver quality products and services. The teams require a common language for communication when dealing with technical solutions and artifacts, in order to work as a cohesive unit for meeting the set objective. The GOF design pattern catalog was a major step in this direction. This was followed by other similar catalogs to empower software engineering teams with a common pool of shared idioms and practices. For all practical purpose, GOF patterns became sine qua non for patterns. But there are other equally important catalogs that&#160;you would want to leverage.</p>
        <p>There have been&#160;attempts to map the pattern catalogs to platforms such as&#160;JEE and .NET. The J2EE --design patterns and Microsoft--patterns and practices catalogs were attempts in this direction. The emergence and adoption of functional programming and reactive programming models mandates a fresh look at the patterns, applied to modern .NET software development. That is where this book comes into the picture. This book provides detailed examples written using C#/.NET, which will help developers map different constructs from various pattern catalogs to executable code.</p>
        <p>The book you have got in your hand outlines author's perspectives about how design, architecture, and domain patterns can be applied in practice by leveraging the .NET platform. The topics covered deals with various patterns and pattern catalogs, including GOF patterns, concurrent programming, object/functional programming, and functional reactive programming. The final chapter talks about materials which we could not cover in this book, but, which a modern programmer should master to become an effective developer.</p>
        <p>Learning, as we all know, is a continuous process. We have made to the best of our ability to impart our learnings on the job so that it benefits any one who is interested. We have leveraged code extensively for illustrating this with very detailed examples. Design illustration in the form of UML and context diagrams accompany the concepts and code. The views and perspectives we have outlined mostly align with the industry references and standards.

        <p>The reader is supposed to have worked with at least a project with the .NET platform using C# as the primary programming language. A good understanding of basic object oriented programming will help you navigate the territory faster. From a software perspective, a laptop, desktop or a virtual machine with Visual Studio 2012 (or above) to test and play around with the source code.</p>

        <p>The book is useful for any C#/.NET developer to understand how enterprise class applications are designed, developed, and deployed. Rather than studying various patterns in isolation, the book deals with scenarios where patterns are often combined to engineer state of the art applications. Developers who work with Java can also follow the book without much difficulty, as both platforms have lot of things in common.</p>

        <p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
        <p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "An instance of this class needs to be passed to the <code class="literal">Sort</code> routine of the <code class="literal">List&lt;T&gt;</code> instance."</p>
        <p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>

        public String name {get;set;} 
        public int age {get;set;} 
        public double salary { get; set; } 
    }</pre>
        <p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">    return function () { 
      try { 
<span class="strong"><strong>        return fn.apply(null, args.slice(1));</strong></span>

        <pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>npm install rx</strong></span>

        <p>
<span class="strong"><strong>New terms </strong></span>and <span class="strong"><strong>important words </strong></span>are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "You could simply do this in JSbin by using the <span class="strong"><strong>Add library option shown in the web editor.</strong></span>"</p>
