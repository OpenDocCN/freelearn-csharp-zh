<h1 id="_idParaDest-16" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor015" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Designing User Interfaces</h1>
<p class="calibre3">When working with UI, it is important to understand a few design basics. This chapter will cover the foundation of designing UI and a few key concepts to start you off in the right direction.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14">Defining UI and GUI</li>
<li class="calibre14">Describing the four types of interfaces</li>
<li class="calibre14">Laying out your user interfaces</li>
<li class="calibre14">Discerning and setting resolution and aspect ratio</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">This book is not about the art of designing UI. It is a technical text that discusses the implementation of UI functionality. However, I do want to discuss some basic design principles of UI design. I don’t expect you to be an amazing UI designer after reading this chapter. I do hope that you get some basic understanding of layout and design principles from this chapter, though, so that maybe your artist friends won’t make too much fun of you.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-17" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor016" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="calibre3">For this chapter, you will need the following:</p>
<p class="calibre3">Unity 2020.3.26f1 or later</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-18" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor017" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Defining UI and GUI</h1>
<p class="calibre3">So, what exactly <a id="_idIndexMarker000" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>do UI and GUI stand for, and what’s the <a id="_idIndexMarker001" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>difference? <strong class="bold">UI</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">user interface</strong> and <strong class="bold">GUI</strong> (pronounced “gooey”) stands for <strong class="bold">graphical user interface</strong>. To <em class="italic">interface</em> means to <em class="italic">interact with</em>, so the UI is the set of devices that let a player interact with a game. The mouse, keyboard, game controller, touch screen, and so on are all part of the UI. The GUI is the subset of the UI represented by graphics. So, onscreen buttons, dropdown menus, and icons are all part of a game’s GUI. As the GUI is a subset of the UI, many people (myself included) tend to just refer to the GUI as the UI. Unity also refers to all the GUI items they provide templates for as the UI.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This book <a id="_idIndexMarker002" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>will focus primarily on GUI design, but it will discuss <a id="_idIndexMarker003" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>some non-graphical aspects of UI controls, such as accessing data from the mouse, screen tap, keyboard, or controller. This chapter specifically will look at some basic design considerations for different interface types.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-19" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor018" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The four game interface types</h1>
<p class="calibre3">When you say “game UI,” most <a id="_idIndexMarker004" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>people think of the <strong class="bold">heads-up display</strong> (<strong class="bold">HUD</strong>) that appears in front <a id="_idIndexMarker005" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>of all the in-game items. However, there are actually four different types of game interfaces: non-diegetic, diegetic, meta, and spatial.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Fagerholt and Lorentzon first described these four different interface types in the 2009 paper <em class="italic">Beyond the HUD: User Interfaces for Increased Player Immersion in FPS Games: Master of Science Thesis</em>. Since then, the terminology has been widely used throughout the field of UI game design. You can find the original publication at <a href="http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/111921.pdf" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/111921.pdf</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The distinction between the four is determined by a cross of the following two dimensions:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14"><strong class="bold">Diegesis</strong>: Is it part of the story?</li>
<li class="calibre14"><strong class="bold">Spatiality</strong>: Is it in the game’s environment?</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">The following diagram demonstrates the cross relationship between the two questions and how they define the four types of interfaces:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.1: Four types of interfaces" src="img/B18327_01_01.jpg" class="calibre17"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1: Four types of interfaces</p>
<p class="calibre3">A game’s HUD falls <a id="_idIndexMarker006" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>into the <strong class="bold">non-diegetic</strong> category. This information exists purely for the player to view and the characters within the game are not aware of its presence. It exists on the <em class="italic">fourth</em> wall of the game view and appears to be on the screen in front of everything. The examples <a id="_idIndexMarker007" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>of this type of UI are endless, as nearly every game has some non-diegetic UI elements.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Alternatively, a <strong class="bold">diegetic</strong> interface is one <a id="_idIndexMarker008" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>that exists within the game world and the characters within the game are aware of its presence. Common examples of this include characters looking at inventory or maps. The most widely referred-to example of diegetic UI is the inventory and health display within <em class="italic">Deadspace</em>. The inventory displays on a holographic display window that pops up in front of the playable character, and he interacts with it as you select his weaponry. His health is also indicated by a meter on his back. The inventory of <em class="italic">Alone in the Dark</em> (2008) is displayed in a diegetic way as well. While there are some UI elements that only the player can see, the main character views inventory within their jacket pockets and interacts with the items. <em class="italic">Uncharted Lost Legacy</em> and <em class="italic">Far Cry 2</em> both use maps that the characters physically hold in the scene and interact with. <em class="italic">Fallout 3</em> and <em class="italic">Fallout 4</em> use a diegetic interface to display the inventory and map on the character’s Pip-Boy, which is permanently attached to their arm. Games also use this type of display when characters are in a vehicle or suit, where various displays appear on the shield, window, or cockpit.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Meta</strong> interfaces are <a id="_idIndexMarker009" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>interfaces that the characters in the game are aware of, but they are not physically displayed within the scene. Common examples of this are speed displays for racing games. <em class="italic">Forza 7</em> actually uses a combination of meta and diegetic displays for the speedometer. A meta speed indicator is persistently on the lower-right corner of the screen for the player to see. Since the character is constantly aware of how fast they are driving, they would be aware of this speed indicator, therefore making it a meta interface. There is also a diegetic speedometer in the car’s dash that is displayed when playing in first-person view. Another common usage of this type of display is a cell phone that appears on the screen but is implied the playable character is interacting with. <em class="italic">Persona 5</em>, <em class="italic">Catherine</em>, and <em class="italic">Grand Theft Auto 5</em> all use this interface type for cell phone interactions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The last type of interface, <strong class="bold">spatial</strong>, exists in <a id="_idIndexMarker010" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>the scene, but the characters within the game are not aware of it. Interfaces that exist in the scene but that the characters are not aware of are incredibly common. This is commonly used to let the player know where in the scene interactable items are, what the in-game character is doing, or information about characters and items in the scene. For example, in <em class="italic">Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, arrows appear over the heads of enemies, indicating who Link will attack. Link is not actually aware of these arrow icons; they are there for the player to know who he is focusing on. <em class="italic">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> uses a spatial interface to indicate where the player can dig by displaying a shovel icon over the diggable areas.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-20" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor019" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Laying out the UI elements</h1>
<p class="calibre3">When laying out the UI for your game, I strongly recommend checking other games of the same genre and <a id="_idIndexMarker011" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>seeing how they implemented their UI. Play the game and see whether it feels good to you.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you are unsure of how to lay out your game’s UI, I recommend dividing the game’s screen into a <em class="italic">guttered grid</em>, like the one shown in the following diagram, and placing items within the non-guttered areas:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.2: A guttered grid" src="img/B18327_01_02.jpg" class="calibre18"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2: A guttered grid</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can use as many grids as you want, but laying out the items with reference to the grid will help ensure that the UI is arranged in a balanced way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In most cases, the HUD items should remain at the outer edges of the grid. Any UI that displays in the center grids will restrict the player view. So, this area is good for pop-up windows that pause the gameplay.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The device your <a id="_idIndexMarker012" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>game will be played on is important when determining the layout. If your game is designed for a mobile device and has a lot of buttons the player will interact with, the buttons are generally best suited for the bottom or side portions of the screen. This is due to the way players hold their phones and the top-center part of the screen is the most difficult area to reach with their thumb. Additionally, reaching for this area will cause them to block the majority of the game view with their hand. We will discuss designing UI for mobile more thoroughly in <a href="B18327_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor024" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You’ll note that when you play computer games, they tend to have much smaller and more cluttered UI than mobile and console games. This is due to visibility and interaction. Clicking on small objects with a mouse is significantly easier than tapping them with a finger or selecting them with the D-pad. Also, the screen resolution is much bigger, which allows for more space to be taken up by the UI.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When trying to determine the size and relative location of UI items, you can reference <strong class="bold">Fitts’ Law</strong>. Fitts’ Law can <a id="_idIndexMarker013" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>mathematically calculate how long it will take a user to navigate to a UI item based on its size and distance away from the user’s starting position. I won’t go over the math here (despite the math teacher in me desperately wanting to), but the lessons that can be garnered from Fitts’ Law are as follows:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14">Don’t make interactable UI small and far apart</li>
<li class="calibre14">Make the most important interactable items the largest and near each other</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Next, we’ll look at resolution and aspect ratio.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-21" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor020" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Resolution and aspect ratio</h1>
<p class="calibre3">A game’s <strong class="bold">resolution</strong> is the pixel dimension of the screen on which it plays. For example, a game <a id="_idIndexMarker014" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>could run at 1,024x768. This means that the game is 1,024 pixels wide <a id="_idIndexMarker015" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>and 768 pixels tall. The <strong class="bold">aspect ratio</strong> of a game is the ratio of the width and height (expressed as width:height). This aspect ratio is determined by dividing the resolution width by the resolution height and then simplifying the fraction. So, for example, if your game has a resolution of 1024x768, the aspect ratio would be as follows:</p>
<p class="calibre3">1024<em class="italic">px</em>/768<em class="italic">px</em>=4/3</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here, the fraction 4/3 is the aspect ratio 4:3.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The following table provides a list of common aspect ratios and related resolutions:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.3: Common aspect ratios and resolutions" src="img/B18327_01_03.jpg" class="calibre19"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3: Common aspect ratios and resolutions</p>
<p class="calibre3">When designing your UI, the resolution and aspect ratio will play an important role in how your UI will look. Knowing the resolution and aspect ratio of your target device will be an important first step in designing your UI for two reasons:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14">It will determine the layout of your UI</li>
<li class="calibre14">The way you build the UI within Unity will be determined by how many resolutions and aspect ratios you plan to support</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">If you build to a single resolution/aspect ratio, the UI will be much easier to build as you won’t have to make sure all the elements maintain their relative position at multiple aspect ratios. However, if you build a game that will run at multiple resolutions/aspect ratios (for example, a mobile project or a web game that scales within a window), you want your UI to <a id="_idIndexMarker016" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>scale and move appropriately. You’ll also want to be able to easily <a id="_idIndexMarker017" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>change the resolution during testing so that you can make sure the UI is positioned appropriately as its display window morphs.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even if you will allow your resolution and aspect ratio to vary, you should still decide on a default resolution. This default resolution represents the resolution of your ideal design. This will be the resolution that your initial design and UI layout are based on, so if the resolution or aspect ratio varies, the UI will try to maintain the same design as best it can.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Since all televisions sold today have a 16:9 aspect ratio, any UI you make for a console game should be developed with a 16:9 aspect ratio in mind.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-22" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor021" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Changing the aspect ratio and resolution of the game view</h2>
<p class="calibre3">You <a id="_idIndexMarker018" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>can easily switch between different resolutions and aspect ratios in the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> tab. This will allow you to see <a id="_idIndexMarker019" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>how your UI scales at the different resolutions and aspect ratios:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre14">If you navigate to your <strong class="bold">Game</strong> tab, you will see the words <strong class="bold">Free Aspect</strong>. Clicking on <strong class="bold">Free Aspect</strong> will reveal a menu that shows various aspect ratios and resolutions:
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.4: Selecting Free Aspect mode from the Game view" src="img/B18327_01_04.jpg" class="calibre20"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4: Selecting Free Aspect mode from the Game view</p>
<p class="calibre3">The items displayed in this list are the most common aspect ratios and resolutions for the build target you currently have selected. In the preceding screenshot, my build target was <strong class="bold">PC, Mac &amp; Linux Standalone</strong>, so the most common <a id="_idIndexMarker020" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>monitor settings are displayed. If I were to <a id="_idIndexMarker021" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>change my build target to iOS, I would see a list of popular iPhone and iPad screen dimensions.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">Free Aspect</strong> means that the game’s aspect ratio will scale relative to the window of the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view. So, by moving the frame around on the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> window, you will change the aspect ratio.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="2" class="calibre14">You can easily see the effects of <strong class="bold">Free Aspect</strong> on your game’s aspect ratio, by setting your Editor’s layout to one that shows both the <strong class="bold">Screen</strong> and <strong class="bold">Game</strong> tabs open simultaneously. For example, setting <strong class="bold">Layout</strong> to <strong class="bold">2 by 3</strong> will do this. Select the <strong class="bold">Layout</strong> dropdown in the top-right corner of the Unity Editor to change the layout.
