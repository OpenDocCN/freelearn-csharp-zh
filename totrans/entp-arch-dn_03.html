<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Following the first chapter explaining the problems information systems globally face and the second one on the general theory of industrialization, it’s time for some actual battle-proved methods! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">Though we will not get our hands on the code or deploy software before </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Part 2</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1"> of the book, this third chapter is much more applied and will show the principle of what is called business/IT alignment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">The idea behind this principle is that the software system should reflect the structure of the business domain it aims to automate as much as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">In a way, this is applying </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Conway’s law</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> (which will be explained) backward, using it to obtain the desired result. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">In practice, it is important to know the map to rule on the ground, so we will be using an information system mapping </span><a id="_idIndexMarker097"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">technique based on the four-layer diagram pushed forward by </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">CIGREF</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1"> (short for </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Club Informatique des Grandes Entreprises Françaises</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">), among </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">other organizations.</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Technical requirements</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">As said in the introduction, this chapter will be more practical than the two previous, theoretical, ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">This means a reading prerequisite—since we will talk about methods of analyzing information systems, you should have previous analytical contact with them at least. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">Sure, everyone uses them nowadays, but you will need a bit more than just experience using them, in particular some knowledge about the different parts they are made of. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.4">Nothing fancy here, but you need to understand the difference between software and hardware and that information systems are generally there to automate business processes, which are sets of human and computer-based tasks organized toward reaching a goal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.5">You will also need to be able to recognize the different parts of such a system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.6">If we call them systems instead of simply software applications, this is because they are more complex and made of several modules. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.7">You need to understand this and be able to tell which parts the system is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">made of.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">You will also need to be able to classify these parts of the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Are they classified by function or by some more concrete, IT-related criteria, such as their position on the on-premises servers versus in the cloud? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">Are they autonomous or do they communicate a lot with other functions, and if so, with which interfaces and protocols? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.4">This is certainly just general knowledge or common sense for most of us, but this is something you will need to be able to read this chapter nonetheless. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.5">This will help you to point out critical questions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.6">For example, when talking about interactions between parts of the systems, are we talking about business dependencies or concrete, IT-related streams of data? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.7">To give you a better understanding of the difference, let’s go over some illustrations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.8">An example of business dependency is when the ordering system depends on the customer’s list. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.9">Indeed, we can record a company with our orders, but it does not make much sense to record an order without knowing the customer who buys the products listed in it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.10">On the other hand, an example of IT-related data streams is when the ordering system accesses the customer’s database to propose an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">existing record</span><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Software for business and the principle of alignment</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">At this point of the book, it should already be quite clear, but it does not harm us to recall that we are only talking about professional information systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">In short, we put ourselves in a case where software really means business: applications that are mission-critical for companies, information systems that help production for a commercial company or a non-profit organization, etc. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">All recommendations that follow would not make any sense on small systems and would be way too complicated if applied to a simple piece of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">software application.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">This being said, the hypothesis is that, since there is a business, there is good knowledge of it; we know who the participants in the business are, what the stakes and objectives of the business are, which strategy is being conducted (even if it is not 100% clearly defined, as happens in a lot of companies), etc. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">This last one is of utmost importance; there is no need to design an information system if the strategic direction has not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">been defined.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Important note</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">It should be emphasized that the definition (even if not completely precise) of the business strategy is an absolute prerequisite to an analysis of enterprise architecture and the mapping of the information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">As an analyst with many years of experience with information systems, I always refuse a project if I realize in the first meetings that there is no company-level strategy, and I recommend anyone to do the same. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">If you are reading this chapter thinking about how you are going to define an information system and realize there is no business-defined strategy, you are better off stopping reading right now and coming back when this essential information becomes clearer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.4">Trust me on this one—if you realize the upcoming steps before the vision of the objectives of the information systems is (at least globally) clear, you are going to waste a lot of your time and do more harm </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">than good.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Why is all this so important? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Because you are going to use the definition of your target business to design the information system to be aligned with it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">Technology should always be at the service of the users, so knowing the business beforehand is what is going to drive the design of the information system (again, there is no need for a perfectly detailed strategy, but at least a vision or a direction). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.4">This is what is called business/IT alignment or, in the context of this book, simply alignment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.5">We will see that this is the only stable method you need to obtain a sound and future-proof information system, free from the problems that have been described in the first chapter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.6">But before we dive more into the method of achieving business/IT alignment, let’s just take a look at other methods that are not business-related but technically driven and learn where they apply and what their limits are when designing complex </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">information systems</span><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">The jungle of technical recommendations</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">If you are a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker099"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">true software professional and worry about the quality of your deliverables, you most certainly have read a lot about technical methods that help in addressing the issue and improving your software skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">You have heard </span><a id="_idIndexMarker100"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">about </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">V-cycle</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">; </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Agile methods</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker101"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">organize software teams; </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">extreme programming</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">; </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">test-driven development</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">; </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">behavior-driven development</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> for </span><a id="_idIndexMarker102"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">practices; programming </span><a id="_idIndexMarker103"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">patterns to improve code</span><a id="_idIndexMarker104"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1"> structure; development-specific </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">key performance indicators</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1"> to follow </span><a id="_idIndexMarker105"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">the quality of code; and so many more that a complete chapter would not be enough to describe </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">them all.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Though there is interest and things to learn from most of them, their sheer number shows the limits of such methods: they are only true in given contexts (otherwise, due to the number, some would oppose others) and, sadly, most of the people writing about them often forget to define this perimeter because they are interested in explaining the technique itself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">The more the technique has helped them to lift a given obstacle, the more they will tend to present it as an essential, go-to recommendation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.3">In extreme cases, the person recommending the practice does not realize the small size of the context operated and will consider this practice as universal, encouraging others to use it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">without limit.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">This is of course where the critical thinking of the reader is expected, but at the same time, the reader should logically be someone who knows less about the domain of expertise of the writer, and it may be difficult for him/her to spot the limits of the content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">“A little knowledge is a dangerous thing”, and the internet is polluted with people who just learned a new trick and will gladly expose it to the community as the solution to everything. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">This enthusiasm is understandable, and I have certainly done this in my blogs or general training activities, but that does not mean there is no solution and, again, the way forward is to improve the critical thinking of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">the</span><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1"> reader.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">An example with KISS, DRY, and WET</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Let’s take an</span><a id="_idIndexMarker106"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1"> example of some practices that you have certainly heard of: </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">KISS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">keep it simple, stupid</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">) and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">DRY</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">don’t repeat yourself</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker107"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">first one states that simplicity should always prevail when creating a software implementation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">This is particularly true in Agile methods since additional features or feedback from the users will certainly force the rewriting of the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">The second one implies that code should never be repeated and that similar blocks of code should be put into a unique function called from the different places in the code where the same function </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">is needed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Before any </span><a id="_idIndexMarker108"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">further analysis, we should note that there seems to be a similarity, or at least quite a strong link, between the two recommendations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">After all, if we reduce the code repetition, we make things simpler (or at least they may appear so, but this is the subject of the following). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.3">We may thus question the use of the two approaches, but again, software engineering is not an industry yet, so every craftsmanship has its own tools and uses. </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Fair enough…</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">But the real point </span><a id="_idIndexMarker109"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">of analysis of these two methods is their context of application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">As with most technical best practices, they do not blindly apply to everything and their use should be carefully pondered. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">Sure, it makes sense to unify a simple function to display a warning when you find it many times in the same class, but how about the same situation with two classes in distinct software applications where the warning label slightly differs? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.4">If the text is not the same, maybe this is because the warning is on a situation that is not the same, so we should analyze the condition on which they are called. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.5">However, as the software modules are not the same, the variables will not necessarily be the same, so it is going to be difficult to analyze the similarity of the situations prompting the warning dialog display. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.6">And how about coupling? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.7">If we decide to keep only one code, which application module should have it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.8">Or should we make another module that stores the code of the dialog box? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.9">And in this case, what about the fact that the life cycle of two applications now influences the versions of this common library, which could certainly become an issue? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.10">Sometimes, unifying code can do more harm </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">than good.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">This kind of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker110"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">discussion has brought lots of reflections, and a new good practice has been proposed by the acronym </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">WET</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1"> (opposite to DRY), standing for </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">write everything three times</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">Indeed, the hesitations exposed mean that, to find the right decision, it is beneficial to wait and gather some more clues on the actual similarity of the contexts of use, and the creator of the method proposes to write the code three times before thinking about unifying it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.3">This is a sound approach, as it avoids the “black or white” approach of the DRY principle and opens a whole domain of a gray area corresponding to the actual truth: it depends on the context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.4">Writing the code, writing it a second time and observing the similarities, then writing it a third time and analyzing the return on the investment of unification certainly is a sound approach... </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.5">but does this make it a law that every programmer should obey? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.6">Of course, no—again, critical thinking applies, and the three times may not apply to you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.7">Maybe you will need five, maybe you will decide the limit will be time-based and not based on the number of occurrences (wait for one year of maintenance, for example). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.8">It is up to you, and I suspect</span><a id="_idIndexMarker111"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1"> three times was chosen partly because it made for quite a humorous opposition to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">DRY principle.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">All this is to say that lots of technical, code-related methods that are used in software development are sometimes presented as hard truth or generally applicable best practices, but, most of the time, they are just principles that apply to a given context, and can (and must) be bent </span><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">fit others.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Before we </span><a id="_idIndexMarker112"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">switch to solutions on the issue just explained (and do not worry, there are some), a most-observed example of how best practices applied without a thorough context analysis can lead to bad situations is the development of bespoke company frameworks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">During the writing of this chapter, I stumbled upon a great article from Aaron Stannard (</span><a href="https://aaronstannard.com/dry-gone-bad-bespoke-company-framework/"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">https://aaronstannard.com/dry-gone-bad-bespoke-company-framework/</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">) that happens to perfectly reflect my own analysis on frameworks after 25 years of programming with or without them, creating some and cursing myself to have done so, adoring some others and realizing they brought a huge value to the software I was responsible </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">for, etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">Aaron Stannard explains in this article how the DRY principle applied too strongly has harsh consequences on teams that develop specialized frameworks to unify coding and, in the end, they obtain results that were the opposite of those that were expected in terms of boilerplate code reduction, scale capacity, and quality </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">of code.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">Some frameworks</span><a id="_idIndexMarker113"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1"> bring huge value to software applications and information systems, and you will easily </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">locate them:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">In this chapter, I am going to repeat this rule and explain it in many different ways, as it is so important for a correct information system architecture—what drives the design of the information systems is the structure of the business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.2">This is particularly true for the concepts, and creating a successful software backbone for a company always starts with a perfect understanding of the business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.3">What is a customer? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.4">What products do we sell? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.5">What are the main processes of the company that ought to be computerized? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.6">Most of these questions sound trivial, but they are only so because human brains can adapt to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">background context.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">Let’s take the very first question: what is a customer? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.2">This is so obvious for anyone in the company that the question is rarely asked, and it would sound quite ridiculous if any employee questioned it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.3">“Customers are companies we do business with”. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.4">All right, but how about individuals? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.5">Yes, sometimes we also deal with individuals; this is the difference between B2B and B2C. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.6">And what if we question the term “doing business with”? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.7">What frequency and volumes are we talking about? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.8">Sure, any volume may be taken into account, and a person buying a simple bolt from you may be considered a customer in the exact same way as a company acquiring thousands of them a month. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.9">But how about time? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.10">Would you consider someone who has bought a product from you twenty years ago still a customer? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.11">No, certainly not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.12">How about one year ago? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.13">Yes, of course... </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.14">In this case, where is the limit? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.15">Ten years? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.16">Five? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.17">Decisions, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">decisions, decisions!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">About this</span><a id="_idIndexMarker125"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1"> previous example, you may find companies where managers do not agree on the exact definition of a customer between marketing and commerce... </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">So, how would you expect a dumb computer to decide this? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.3">The hard truth is that, if you want to replace some tasks with software and data streams, you will have to make everything absolutely crystal clear for it to work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.4">This is where most of the information systems fail—they have not been designed with a perfectly accurate view of the business, leaving some details to the implementation or use of the system by humans. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.5">It may work for some time when humans compensate for the missing knowledge in the computer, but sooner or later, there will be trouble. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.6">In the best case, the system will never be as efficient as expected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.7">In the worst case, people leaving the company with their compensating knowledge will cause the system to come to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">a halt.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">What does this example show us? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">First, one should be extremely clear with the business definitions when it comes to making a software information system deal with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.3">The second is that, very often, these concepts are business rules, which means they are not perfectly stable but depend on how the business is run. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.4">The definition of the customer may change in time if your boss decides one day that the list of customers should not present the ones that have not bought anything from you in the last three years, where this duration previously was five years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.5">If this situation is bound to happen from time to time, it is of course of utmost importance that its impact on the information system is limited. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.6">Putting this logic in a unified line of code or, even better, in a parameter is a great move in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">this case.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">On the contrary, storing the list of customers and their definitions in a single table will cause great coupling because the definition (name, address, contacts, etc.) will not change when the “customer status” does. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">If removing a company from the customers’ list means you have to delete the entry from your databases, there may be an impact on other functions that still need this data (for example, guarantee management, accountants, etc.). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.3">We will come back to this example in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">Chapter 9</span></em></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1"> with some more details on how to model it correctly, but for now, please remember that business thinking must always guide how your software concepts will work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.2">Alignment is not something that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker126"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">arises from nothing or goes both ways—it is driven by functions, and the software should blindly follow the business </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">domain ontology.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">In fact—and this will be the last bit in this section—sticking to the business domain reality should even go one step further and in particular stick with it </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">in time</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">This means that your model should always accommodate time since the business always varies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.3">Change is the only constant in life; businesses cannot escape this and rather are highly dependent on it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.4">With ever-changing business rules, more and more complex organizations, and higher functional sophistication, the information system must be designed from the beginning to accommodate change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.5">Management of time is so important that the next chapter will b</span><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">e completely dedicated </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">to it.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">Melvin Conway</span><a id="_idIndexMarker131"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1"> stated in 1967 that “any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure”. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">In our case study, which is information systems, this means that the architecture of the resulting system will reflect the structural organization of the team defining it, and this would imply </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">A team with a strong separation between frontend and backend will produce a system where these two software functions are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">indeed independent</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">This last example may look like an extreme, but, sadly, this is the case with most information systems because the teams are generally composed with a single piece of software in mind, resulting in many applications composing the system without the interoperation having been thought out in advance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.2">Thus, links are established in an upon-needed, point-to-point manner, resulting in brittle links and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">inefficient systems.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">Some of the most important of these attributes are linked to the organization of the functions inside the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.2">Things may vary, and there is no fixed standard for this, but there is at least a good metaphor that has been used for decades and bears good results, which consists of creating a parallelism between information systems and cities’ organizations (in France, this approach is called “urbanization”). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.3">This metaphor leads to decomposing the second layer of the CIGERF map in three levels </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">of depth:</span></span></p>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">Quarters/neighborhoods</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1"> are a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker154"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1"> finer subdivision corresponding to the local organization of a system, with people, businesses, or, in our case, IT functions potentially talking to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">each other.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">Blocks/islands</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1"> are </span><a id="_idIndexMarker155"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">the fine divisions inside which people know each other and interact often. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">In the corresponding IT definition, these contain functions that are closely related because they use the same tool or because the same team </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">operates them.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">I am often </span><a id="_idIndexMarker156"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">asked what kind of decomposition should be used, at least for the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker157"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1"> top-most level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.2">This is a difficult one, as the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">business capability map</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">BCM</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">) (as this second layer of the CIGREF map is often called) is most of the time simply non-existent in companies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.2">Lots of them have a clear view of their processes due to ISO 9001 certification and the relative standardization of the approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.3">Companies can also track down their software layer, at least for the biggest blocks for which they are billed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.4">But in the middle, this BCM is quite often forgotten, and we will see a bit further that this is the source of loss of misalignments in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">the systems.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">The fact that this layer is forgotten is in itself a big part of the problem in many information systems, as leaders may favor the process layer (the objectives) and put less effort into the BCM (how to realize them). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.2">Yet, a vision without a plan is just a wish, as the proverb says, and a well-crafted functional organization of the system is a great step forward </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">to success.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">In this metaphor with urban development, the business capability map is cut in the same way that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker158"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">would be associated with the composition of a large city; just like there are industrial, commercial, and living areas in a city, there will be a global organization in an information system, often in the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">five areas:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">With the next two </span><a id="_idIndexMarker169"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">layers of the CIGREF map, we enter the realm of technology. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.2">For now, processes and functions were purely business-related and one could very well use them for a computer-free information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.3">But this is not what we have today, and the subject of analysis in this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.4">We will work on computer-based, at least partially automated systems here, and the two technical layers that the top ones rely on are about implementing the function with computers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.5">Their separation is extremely easy: the third layer is everything that is “soft”, which means immaterial, virtual, and non-concrete, whereas the fourth layer groups everything that is concrete. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.6">To say</span><a id="_idIndexMarker170"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1"> it as simply as possible: if you can touch it (computer, network cables, appliances, data centers —even if the walls do not belong to you), it will go to the next layer that we will cover a bit later. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.2">If it is technical but not “touchable”, such as a software application, a database, a stream of information, an API implementation, etc., it belongs in the third level in the CIGREF map, which we will detail </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1">right now.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">This third level is in general quite easy for the companies to create in its first implementation: looking at bills and asking people what software they use is generally enough to find out the 80% most important uses of software in your system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.2">But, even if exhaustive referencing is not the goal, this may not be enough for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">two reasons.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">First, there may be</span><a id="_idIndexMarker171"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1"> some “hidden” software that has been bought by a service without the company knowing (this is called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">shadow IT</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1"> and can be a problem where maintenance or strong ownership is needed). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.2">There is a risk that they will not appear on the map if they are strategic, and this might become a problem also if people using them suddenly leave and the associated functions collapse without anyone understanding why. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.3">If you have heard stories of a company having software problems after a key person retired, this is what we are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">talking about.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1">The second problem is that software is not only applications but also data, and data is usually harder to locate and follow in a system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.2">Sure, you can locate databases with their commercial licenses or the IP and port they use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.3">But you will find data in so many other places, such as dreaded Excel worksheets. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.4">Again, who has not heard of an Excel workbook that was so important for the company that everyone knew about it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.5">In one of the companies I accompanied in business/IT alignment, there was “Serge’s Excel file”, which everyone kept telling me about when I was trying to figure out where the source of truth was for the articles and prices for the company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.6">It turned out that, in this company of almost a thousand employees, there was no governance at all on product information management, and this person called Serge, at some point when he desperately needed the information, took the job of collecting the data from commerce, administration, and engineering and putting it together in an Excel workbook, trying his best to follow the changes, new products, end-of-life dates, changes in price, etc. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.7">As this was not his primary job, he had little time to do so and the content of the file was neither complete nor free from errors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.8">But since this was the only source of data available, everybody quickly copied Serge’s file or referred to it with server links. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.9">The managers never considered the fragility of this approach to a hugely important source of data (maybe even the primary referential of a commercial company together with the list of customers), and guess what happened when Serge eventually left the company? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.10">The system slowly decayed because it was nobody’s job to maintain the one-person, non-documented work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.11">Information became dirtier, orders started to be false, prices could not be adjusted because most people using the information in the file or in the connectors that had been created on it had no clue where the data was coming </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">from, etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">One may </span><a id="_idIndexMarker172"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">object that what I am talking about is not part of the third layer but relates to the second one, and indeed, master data management and data governance and ownership have to be detailed on the second level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.2">But in this case, I wanted to show that a poor technical implementation (which definitely belongs to the third layer) and a lack of understanding about where the data in its software form stands were the root of the problem that went right up to the first level of the map and derailed two of the main processes of the company, namely production, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">and sales.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">Categorizing the content of this third layer really depends on a lot of factors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.2">Some companies with strong internal IT and programming capacities will tend to have the applications and data grouped by the technical team that operates on it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.3">I have seen others grouping the software layer by technology, as their main concern was to operate the technologies internally even though they were—for the most part—bought on the shelf. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.4">In some cases, software can be sorted by editors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.5">And there are many other ways to sort it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.6">In the next example (once again blurred for confidentiality reasons), the cutting has been done using functional domains, as the company was quite big and the software application and data’s responsibility had been affected by the business directions and services (which is quite a good practice, as software should always </span><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1">be at the service of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">the functions):</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">As explained </span><a id="_idIndexMarker173"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">before, the hardware layer lists and organizes everything from the information system that is concrete. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.2">After all, the important bits of computerized systems are data and virtual functions that dramatically accelerate the processes, but we should never forget that, even though in a remote cloud location nobody really cares, all this is realized by electrons flowing in electronic chips and board, with power supplies, cabling, hard disks, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">screens somewhere.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">This layer is nowadays very standardized and under control and, in dozens of information systems where I have analyzed shortcomings in alignment and performance, virtually none of them exposed this limitation due to a hardware problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.2">In fact, it is so rare that in most of the CIGREF maps I have done, the fourth layer is very thin, with almost no details, or sometimes it’s not even represented at all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.3">For example, if we take the big picture of the different layers I have shown you as samples, it so happens that nothing was represented for the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">hardware layer:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">If you have to draw a hardware layer, you will find lots of excellent diagramming systems that distinguish between server types, can provide dedicated icons and metadata so you can list hardware atoms separately, etc. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.2">All in all, again, this is a very controlled and standardized layer, which certainly explains why we rarely have to work on it when </span><a id="_idIndexMarker175"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">talking about IT alignment, other than referring to it to complete the software costs and balancing the sum to the benefits expected from the first </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">two layers.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.1">What should we map?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.1">First of all, one</span><a id="_idIndexMarker178"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.1"> should never map the entire system in detail. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.2">It is, of course, essential to have a coarse map covering the whole perimeter of it to understand what we are dealing with, but only the parts of the system that need attention should be mapped in detail. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.3">That may sound obvious, but there have been so many times with teams I’ve advised where I realized, a few weeks after explaining the method, that they had diagrammed absolutely everything in the information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.4">Thus, this advice needs to be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.1">put forward.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.1">It just seems like a natural reaction, in particular for teams with heavy problems in their system, to map everything, as it gives a sensation of recovering a bit of control. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.2">Sadly, this is not only a waste of time during the creation of the map, but also a waste of time afterward, when people will try and adjust the diagram following the evolution of the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.3">This is not what system diagramming is for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.4">The map is used to anticipate evolution and force it as much as possible in the direction we have decided. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.5">Thus, it should only be done in detail on parts of the system that we are working on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.6">Diagramming in advance is a waste because we will have to do it again once we get to work on this portion of the system in most cases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.7">Mapping everything is a waste of time for the same reason, and even more, because there are (hopefully) parts of the system we will never work on, simply because they work </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.1">fine already!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.1">Again, that may sound obvious when explained but, when one starts mapping an information system, there seems to be some kind of frenzy mapping happening and I have seen many times well-educated and experienced people realizing that they had worked for nothing (the best example I have is an organization with thousands of employees where the IT team had diagrammed a process for establishing badges to access the internal restaurant; this diagram was of course never used and certainly not even read by anyone else than </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.1">its creators).</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1">One of the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker182"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1"> problems that almost always happens in the system and has an impact on its map is that confusion is frequent between the processes in layer 1 and the dependencies in layer 3. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.2">Most functional people tend to think that their IT system implements processes exactly like they have been designed; how naive of them... </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.3">Software is not necessarily made in-house and, when bought on the shelf, there is almost no chance that it perfectly fits the company’s process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.4">Of course, everyone at the beginning of a new software project will swear that they will abide by the editor’s logic and adjust their process to keep the solution generic and avoid costly specific customizations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.5">But the reality in most of these situations is that IT will end up integrating the software hammering circles in square holes and the result will not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1">be clean.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1">This lack of distinction also happens when functional people express themselves in technical terms without fully understanding the consequences of what they say on the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.2">Come on, we’ve all at some point had managers or big bosses talk about ESB or ETL as if they were able to write the Camel route themselves in XML! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.3">This overconfidence in IT’s simplicity also brings interesting statements of project duration once a BPMN is drawn and functional authors are convinced that it can simply be executed, just like it was a WS-BPEL schema with endpoints </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">already existing.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">The four-layer diagram method for service providers</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">You may </span><a id="_idIndexMarker187"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">wonder about the use of the CIGREF map when buying software as a service and whether it means that we do not draw anything in the hardware layer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.2">The answer comes back to the use you want to have of your map, as you do not map for the pleasure of having something complete but because your use case needs you to be precisely aware of how your information system is working in its details. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.3">This means that, if your interest is in software alignment functions, you have absolutely no use in knowing where the servers are physically, and, in this case, there is no use in drawing anything in the fourth layer; you will simply leave it empty. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.4">On the other hand, suppose one of your concerns is about the locality of your data because your board has a constraint on data sovereignty. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.5">In this case, you will indicate the precise region in which the data centers supporting the software are located in the fourth layer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.6">This way, it will be easy to spot something that is outside the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">allowed regions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">This comes </span><a id="_idIndexMarker188"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1">back to a very important piece of advice: only map what you really need. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.2">It is very easy to get carried away and map lots of things that you actually do not really care about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.3">In particular, the hardware layer is generally quite easy to map because automatic network exploration applications can help and good system administrators often have agents on every machine deployed for security and software inventory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.4">So, people tend to have a very precise drawing of the fourth layer, even when their problem is about function to software alignment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.5">In this case, you’d be better off replacing the whole hardware layer with a few general blocks—typically the data centers used, including your own server room—and labeling them with the associated cost, as this is (in this case) the only information that will </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">help you.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">Talking about services, an equivalent question can be asked the other way around, namely about the CIGREF representation for a software editor or integrator that would provide a software service to its customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.2">How should we represent this? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.3">Is the cloud used for the customers a part of the information system of the editor? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.4">Should it be drawn in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1">particular way?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">Again, the notion of the usefulness of the map should drive our response to this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.2">Imagine the problem at hand—and thus the reason why you establish a map—is that you have a problem of coupling between your internal functions and your offer for your customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.3">This can be a security problem because ransomware on one side could easily propagate to the other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.4">This may also come from the accounting team, which does not know which machines and services should be billed to customers and which costs should remain internal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.5">It could also come from system management difficulties, such as the fact that shutting down a supposedly internal server eventually had an impact on your production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.6">In this case, the right approach would be to draw the current, unique information system and then to draw the target map, which is composed of two distinct information systems and a precise representation of the interactions remaining between them (for example, sending the usage data from the production information system to the internal information system so that accounting can establish billing for the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1">different tenants).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1">This is typically</span><a id="_idIndexMarker189"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.1"> where you would use the zone for “externally oriented functions” of your business capability map (layer 2 of the CIGREF representation). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.2">In the production information system, you would find in this zone the function for “reporting data usage per tenant” or “sending total API calls per tenant”. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.3">And in the internal information system, you would find, of course, in the “business” zone/“accounting” quarter, the function to handle this data and calculate the bill for the tenant. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.4">Another example would be functions such as “request tenant access blocking” or “archive tenant” that you would find in the “externally oriented functions” zone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.5">They would typically be called by the internal information system to instruct the production information system that a customer has not paid the bill and should be at least blocked, and maybe later, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.1">completely removed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.1">Another example of a link between the two systems is, of course, when the internal software-production workflow has produced a validated, complete new release of the software sold to the customers (this is the main role of the software editing company). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.2">There has to be a link somewhere since the information system exposing this software to customer tenants will use this deliverable to update its services at some point. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.3">One of the best ways to establish this link while keeping very low coupling is to create a container registry that will be filled with images coming from the first system (with the right tags, of course) and consumed by the second information system by pulling the images it needs to expose in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.1">the tenants.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.1">The only remaining question is where the registry should be placed, and the answer—if you need a very stable one—is to have one on each side: a registry that centralizes all the production from your continuous integration as a software editing company on one side and another registry that serves as an image cache on the other side. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.2">This makes it easier for your continuous deployment as an integrating company to keep on creating tenants even if the first registry is not accessible anymore. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.3">This clean separation can even be used to implement some high-level rules, such as “only contained images with the STABLE tag should be put into production”, by caching only those in the second </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.567.1">Docker registry.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.1">One might argue that, since there are calls between the two systems in this case, that might mean they are a single system and should be represented as so. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.2">Again, the map is not here to reflect the full reality of the world but to help you carry out your duty in information management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.3">If the orientation you wish to have is a good separation of concerns (and for security reasons, it should be), then your map should represent your goal, as it will help you in doing everything that is needed to reach </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.1">this objective.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.1">Finally, another </span><a id="_idIndexMarker190"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.1">argument could be opposed to this vision, by stating that, today, every information system on the planet has some kind of connection together, may it only be by the internet network, that covers almost every local system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.2">Also, when companies buy others, they connect their information systems, sometimes in such a tightly knitted way that they become a single system in the end. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.3">Again, this only depends on</span><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.1"> your strategy, so the CIGREF map should simply be aligned with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.1">the vision.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.1">This quite long chapter showed how a formalized diagramming technique can be used to obtain a better understanding of an information system and also document the evolutions it will have to follow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.2">A map is a prerequisite to control a given ground, and a schema is worth a thousand words, which makes this step a must in any information system </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.1">architecture activity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.1">Since IT is quite a specific context, we needed a dedicated way of drawing a map of an information system, and this is what the CIGREF map is about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.2">Its four-layer arrangement helps separate the business-oriented aspects (processes and atomic functions) from the technical aspects (software </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.1">and hardware).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.1">This way of representing an information system also helps in visualizing its alignment, by checking that the third layer (the software bits) is well adjusted to the second layer (the business capability map) it implements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.2">The business/IT alignment is the most important measure of quality and capacity to evolve for complex information systems and a feature that must </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.1">be sought.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.1">The next chapter will extend the present one by taking into account the dimension of time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.2">We have quickly talked about this in a previous section, explaining that the CIGREF map could be used to document the actual state of an information system, but also the desired future states it should progressively reach (the Big Bang approach is never a practical alternative). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.3">But, as you will see, time appears in many other aspects of information systems and can be quite a difficult parameter </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.1">to handle.</span></span></p>
