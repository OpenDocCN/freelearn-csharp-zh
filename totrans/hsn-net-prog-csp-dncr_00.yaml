- en: Network programming is a complex undertaking, with the potential for an extremely
    high impact on the performance and scalability of the software it supports. Learning
    to leverage the high-level language constructs and features of C# and the .NET
    Core libraries can help engineers to fine-tune their network applications to the
    performance modern users have come to expect. This book is written to serve as
    a comprehensive exploration of the concepts of network programming, as viewed
    through the lens of the .NET Core framework. It seeks to explain every aspect
    of computer networks, and the software that makes those networks possible. Using
    little more than the .NET Core SDK and a code editor, the contents of this book
    demonstrate how to implement flexible, stable, and reliable software to facilitate
    large-scale computer networking.

- en: If you have any experience with object-oriented programming languages, and would
    like to learn more about how C# and .NET Core can facilitate network and web programming,
    this book is for you. Additionally, if you administer or manage network resources
    and would like to develop the skills to manage or customize your network with
    the tools available in .NET Core, this book is an excellent resource. And finally,
    if you have any experience with network programming, but would like to take a
    closer look at the .NET Core framework, this is the book for you.
