			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Chapter 4: Creating Projects and Templates</h1>
			<p>A template within Visual Studio is a set of files, references, project properties, and compilation options for working with a particular technology. Templates provide us with basic code to work with and acts as a guide that we can follow and complete by including our business logic and requirements. Different templates are installed according to the workloads that have been selected during Visual Studio installation, although there are templates that will be installed by default, such as class libraries. Depending on the project or technology we want to use, we will find different template options to choose from. Selecting the right template that fits your needs is the best action that you can take to evade technical debt and future issues in your architecture. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will analyze the main web development templates provided by Visual Studio 2022 and the options available to customize these templates. Also, during this chapter, we will understand how to pick the best template for our projects, considering the scope, requirements, and expertise of the team. </p>
			<p>We will review the following topics in this chapter: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Selecting and searching for templates</li>
				<li>Templates for .NET Core</li>
				<li>Templates for <strong class="bold">application programming interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">APIs</strong>)</li>
				<li>Templates for .NET Framework </li>
				<li>Templates for <strong class="bold">single-page application</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPA</strong>) projects</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's see what these templates are all about and how to work with them.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow along with this chapter, you must have previously installed Visual Studio 2022 with the web development workload, as shown in <a href="B17873_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Visual Studio 2022</em>. </p>
			<p>You can check out the changes made to the project at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Visual-Studio-2022/tree/main/Chapter04">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Visual-Studio-2022/tree/main/Chapter04</a></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Selecting and searching for templates</h1>
			<p>As mentioned in <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>the introduction of this chapter, Visual Studio has many <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>templates that we can use with .NET and other technologies, depending on the type of project you are working on.</p>
			<p>To explore the templates in Visual Studio 2022, just open Visual Studio and select the <strong class="bold">Create a new project</strong> option:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer057" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.01_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – The Visual Studio Create a new project option"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – The Visual Studio Create a new project option</p>
			<p>After selecting this option, we will see a list of templates to choose from for creating our new project, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.2</em>. Similarly, on the left side, we will be able to see the templates we have recently selected, with the option to pin or unpin each template, so that we can quickly select the templates that we use the most:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.02_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 – The option to pin or unpin a template in the Recent project templates section"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 – The option to pin or unpin a template in the Recent project templates section</p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> Figure 4.2</em>, we also see a search bar at the top for filtering the different templates. If you know the name or the technology that you will use, you can type the term related to it and start searching for the template. The search engine will show you all the templates that include the term you have entered.</p>
			<p>Below the search bar, we can also see three drop-down controls, which also serve as filters to search for <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>templates related to the programming language, platforms, or types <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>of projects we want to create. Among the most important options for each of these filters, we can find the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">All languages</strong>:<ul><li><strong class="bold">C#</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Python</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">TypeScript</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Visual Basic</strong></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">All platforms</strong>:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Android</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Azure</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">iOS</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Linux</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Windows</strong></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">All project types</strong>:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Cloud</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Desktop</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Games</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Mobile</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Test</strong></li><li><strong class="bold">Web</strong></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, it is possible to <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>combine the filters with the search bar. For example, you <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>can type <strong class="source-inline">.NET Core</strong> and select the <strong class="bold">C#</strong> option in the language drop-down menu to get all the projects related to .NET Core and C#, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer059" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.03_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 – The .NET Core templates for C#&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 – The .NET Core templates for C#</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 4.3</em>, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>see many kinds of projects related to .NET Core that Visual Studio <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>has found, according to the filters and workloads selected during installation. </p>
			<p>At the end of the results, you will have an option to install other templates if you cannot find the option that you are looking for:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer060" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.04_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4 – The option to install more tools and features in Visual Studio &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4 – The option to install more tools and features in Visual Studio </p>
			<p>It is important to note that each template has a description including the details related to the template, so we can easily identify whether the template includes the structure and schema that we need.</p>
			<p>Lastly, when the description of the template contains the <strong class="bold">Empty</strong> keyword, it means that the template doesn't <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>contain elements or modules by default and includes either <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>demos or examples, such as a guide, for the developer. This kind of template only includes the project and the base components to compile and run.</p>
			<p>Now that we know how to use the template selection window, let's look at the most important templates for web development.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Templates for .NET Core</h1>
			<p>Let's start this section <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>knowing the difference between .NET Core <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>and ASP.NET Core:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>.NET Core (now called .NET) is a cross-platform, free, and open source framework used to <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>create web, desktop, mobile, and other <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>kinds of applications, using a standard library and C#, Visual Basic, or F# as a programming language.</li>
				<li>ASP.NET Core, on the <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>other hand, is a multi-platform web <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>technology for creating modern applications using .NET. This is why, although the .NET Core framework has been replaced with .NET 6, you will still find terms related to .NET Core as a part of the templates.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If we want to create a new clean project of the ASP.NET Core type, we can search and select the <strong class="bold">ASP.NET Core Empty</strong> template. This template will create a simple API project that, when executed, will display the <strong class="bold">Hello World</strong> message. To configure the new project, we must enter a project name, such as <strong class="source-inline">AspCoreEmpty</strong>. </p>
			<p>Also, we must indicate <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>the location to save the project. You can choose to leave the <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>default path, or select a custom path, such as <strong class="source-inline">C:\demos\AspCoreEmpty</strong>. </p>
			<p>Finally, set the name of the solution. By default, it will be the same as the project, but you can change it to another name. In <em class="italic">Figure 4.5</em>, we have kept the same name:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer061" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.05_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5 – Configuring a new ASP.NET Core Empty project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5 – Configuring a new ASP.NET Core Empty project</p>
			<p>After clicking <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>on the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button, you will be shown a new <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>window, as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer062" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.06_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6 – Creating the ASP.NET Core Empty project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6 – Creating the ASP.NET Core Empty project</p>
			<p>As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.6</em>, you can configure the following options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Framework</strong>: This dropdown will show you the set of frameworks available to work with the selected <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>technology. Although it is possible to select <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>older frameworks, it is always advisable to create new projects with the latest version of the framework available.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Configure for HTTPS</strong>: This checkbox allows you to configure the project to use a self-signed SSL certificate. If you are working on such a project for the first time, you will be asked to trust the certificate when you run the application so that everything works correctly. Although it is possible to work with the HTTP protocol, it is always recommended to use HTTPS in real life.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enable Docker</strong>: This option allows you to enable Docker support in your project. This means that a Docker file will be generated, which you can then publish – for example, to Microsoft Azure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In our example (<em class="italic">Figure 4.6</em>), we select <strong class="bold">.NET 6</strong> as a target framework. The <strong class="bold">Configure for HTTPS</strong> option is <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>marked by default, and it is optional for this demo. Finally, you <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>can click on <strong class="bold">Create</strong> to complete the wizard and create the project. </p>
			<p>After creating the project, we can analyze the structure of the created project, which is simple, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.7</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer063" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.07_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.7 – The ASP.NET Core Empty project in Visual Studio&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7 – The ASP.NET Core Empty project in Visual Studio</p>
			<p>In the panel called <strong class="bold">Solution Explorer</strong>, we can see all the files related to the template created for the project. </p>
			<p>There are only two files related to the structure of the project, which are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">appsettings.json</strong>: This is a JSON file that contains all the settings by default for an ASP.NET Core project.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Program.cs</strong>: This is the entry point of an application that contains a sequence of commands to configure and start the application.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this template we have selected, a new concept introduced in .NET 6 is used, called Minimal APIs, which is <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>a way to have the minimum code necessary to create a <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>simple endpoint, using helper functions inside <strong class="source-inline">Program.cs</strong>. </p>
			<p>By default, when the application is executed, it will show a <strong class="bold">Hello world</strong> message, returned in a <strong class="source-inline">GET</strong> method and mapped into the base URL – for example, <strong class="source-inline">http://myapiurl/</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Minimal API is a new <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>template included in .NET 6 that is very useful for creating simple APIs, such as demos, small services, serverless functions, and microservices.</p>
			<p>Now, let's create a new project with the <strong class="bold">ASP.NET Core Web App</strong> template to analyze its structure. Open Visual Studio 2022 as we did in <em class="italic">Figure 4.4</em>, and select <strong class="bold">Create a new project</strong>. Then, search for the term <strong class="source-inline">ASPNET</strong> and select the <strong class="bold">ASP.NET Core Web App</strong> template:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer064" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.08_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.8 – Searching by ASPNET and selecting the ASP.NET Core Web App template&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.8 – Searching by ASPNET and selecting the ASP.NET Core Web App template</p>
			<p>Then, click on <strong class="bold">Next</strong> and fill <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>out the information required for the new <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>project, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.9</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer065" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.9_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.9 – Configuring the new ASP.NET Core Web App project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9 – Configuring the new ASP.NET Core Web App project</p>
			<p>After filling out the additional <a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>information for the project, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4.10</em>, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>click on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button to generate the project with the ASP.NET Core Web App template:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer066" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.10_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.10 – Additional options for the new ASP.NET Core Web App template&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.10 – Additional options for the new ASP.NET Core Web App template</p>
			<p>This template is perfect if you want to create a web application using .NET and C# running on the server. Also, it <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>uses razor pages (syntaxes that combine C# with <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>HTML in <strong class="source-inline">cshtml</strong> extension files) to build a web application into small and reusable pieces.  </p>
			<p>Modern applications normally run in the browser because they run faster and have a better <strong class="bold">search engine optimization</strong> (<strong class="bold">SEO</strong>), which improves the traffic to your website. However, server-side <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>applications are still very useful for dashboards, internal projects, administration panels, and many other types of web applications. </p>
			<p>An ASP.NET Core Web project contains a <strong class="source-inline">wwwroot</strong> folder, which you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 4.11</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer067" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.11_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.11 – The structure of an ASP.NET Web project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.11 – The structure of an ASP.NET Web project</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">wwwroot</strong> folder is associated with static files such as CSS, images, and JavaScript files. There is also a folder called <strong class="source-inline">Pages</strong> that contains all the UI pieces. </p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Index.cshtml</strong> is an example where you can see C# code mixed with HTML code. The <strong class="source-inline">@</strong> character allows you <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>to use the C# code in the file. <strong class="source-inline">@model</strong>, for example, sets <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>the model type to map the values on the page.</p>
			<p>Other kinds of .NET Core project templates include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Console App</strong>: This template creates a simple console application. Normally, we use this kind of application when we are starting out and learning. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Class Library</strong>: This allows you to create components and classes to share across different projects. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Templates for APIs</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Templates for SPAs</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are the recommended templates, as they are the most updated and in line with the latest versions of .NET.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Templates for APIs</h1>
			<p>Today, it is almost a rule that applications use API-based endpoints. This is because they provide a high level <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>of security and <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>interoperability by not depending on a particular technology or operating system, and they can be scaled according to the existing demand. Also, we can implement advanced architecture, such as microservices using APIs, where all our business logic is distributed in small isolated and standalone services. </p>
			<p>Due to the great importance of being able to develop solutions based on APIs, Visual Studio 2022 incorporates a special template so that we can create APIs based on .NET 6, which we can search by filtering the <strong class="source-inline">api</strong> term, as can be seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4.12</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer068" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.12_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.12 – Filtering by API and selecting the ASP.NET Core Web API&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.12 – Filtering by API and selecting the ASP.NET Core Web API</p>
			<p>Once we have selected the template, we will have to fill in the complementary information, according to our needs, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4.13</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer069" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.13_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.13 – Configuring the ASP.NET Core Web API project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.13 – Configuring the ASP.NET Core Web API project</p>
			<p>In the next window, we will be asked to select the version of the framework and whether we require some type of authentication, among other data that we have already seen in the <em class="italic">Templates for .NET Core</em> section. However, we have a couple of additional options <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>that we do not see in a <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>normal ASP.NET Core project, which are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">User controllers</strong>: If this option is selected, the use of controller files will be enabled from the configuration. If it is deselected, a feature called minimal APIs will be used, which will create the minimum code necessary to have a functional API.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enable OpenAPI support</strong>: Swagger is a set of open source tools based on the OpenAPI specification that will allow us to describe the APIs we create in a simple, easy, and well-structured way, providing API users with good documentation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For our example, we will leave both options selected, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4.14</em>, so that you can see the resulting structure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer070" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.14_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.14 – Selecting options in Additional information for the ASP.NET Core Web API project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.14 – Selecting options in Additional information for the ASP.NET Core Web API project</p>
			<p>Once the project has <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>been created, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>see that a folder called <strong class="source-inline">Controllers</strong> has been created as part of the project:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer071" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.15_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.15 – The structure of an ASP.NET Core API project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.15 – The structure of an ASP.NET Core API project</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="source-inline">Controllers</strong> folder, we will find the controllers that will be created as part of the API. Remember <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>that we can see the controllers in this <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>folder because of the <strong class="bold">Use controllers</strong> option we selected in <em class="italic">Figure 4.14</em>.</p>
			<p>To run or execute the application, we need to use the green arrow or play icon in the standard toolbar:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer072" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.16_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.16 – The play button to start the project in Visual Studio&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.16 – The play button to start the project in Visual Studio</p>
			<p>We can <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>start the project with debugging on or <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>off. In this case, either option is fine. We just want to see how the project looks.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">There are some useful shortcuts to start a project. You can use <em class="italic">F5</em> on your keyboard to run the project in debugging mode, and <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">F5</em> to start the project without debugging.</p>
			<p>If we proceed to run the application, it will immediately take us to a window with the URL ending at <strong class="source-inline">/swagger/index.html</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer073" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.17_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.17 – The Swagger page for the ASP.NET Web API project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.17 – The Swagger page for the ASP.NET Web API project</p>
			<p>Here, we will be able to find all the functionality available in our API documented through Swagger – this means all the endpoints that we create from the controllers in our project. Swagger is a library that uses the OpenAPI standard to show all the endpoints, including the <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>parameters required and the type of values returned.</p>
			<p>From this same page, we will be able to test each one of the endpoints, for the purpose of validating them, and carry out necessary debugging when some endpoint does not work as <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>expected. As you can appreciate, this tool is <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>of great help, both for development purposes and for providing users with documentation of the created API.</p>
			<p>This template gives us everything we need to create our own modern APIs from scratch. Let's now take a look at the templates available for working with .NET Framework.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Templates for .NET Framework</h1>
			<p>.NET Framework is the <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>original implementation of .NET, released by Microsoft <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>in 2002. The long-term idea was to make this <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>framework a multi-platform framework. Unfortunately, it always worked officially on Windows devices, due to API restrictions. To solve this problem, specific versions of the framework were created to support different platforms, which caused a fragmentation of the platform. Through the experience gathered from these projects launched over time, the Microsoft team has finally succeeded in unifying the .NET platform.</p>
			<p>As, for many years, the .NET Framework platform was the primary framework for developing .NET applications, many companies around the world use ASP.NET Web Forms, MVC, or Web API applications, based on .NET Framework. This is the reason why .NET Framework templates are still included in Visual Studio. This does not mean that it is advisable to <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>create applications using such templates. You should <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>always opt for the use of modern technologies that have current and constant support.</p>
			<p>Although there are several templates with .NET Framework, there is one that really interests us for web <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>development. This is called <strong class="bold">ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)</strong>, which you can search for with the <strong class="source-inline">net framework</strong> term, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4.18</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer074" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.18_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.18 – Searching with net framework&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.18 – Searching with net framework</p>
			<p>Once you select the template, in the next window, you will see numerous fields to fill in, which will be familiar to you, such as the project name and location, among other data. The important <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>point is to note that we have a dropdown that shows <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>us a significant number of versions of .NET Framework that we can work with. We will select the last version in this example, as you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 4.19</em>:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.19 – Configuring ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)</p>
			<p>Once we have selected the framework, we can choose what type of application we want to create – the options include a clean project, templates for web forms, MVC-based projects, web APIs, and single-page applications, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4.20</em>:</p>

			<p>The selection of these templates will depend on the needs of the application, although, as mentioned <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>at the beginning of this section, it is recommended to <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>opt for templates that are oriented toward .NET.</p>
			<p>Let's move on to review the category of SPA's templates, which is oriented toward the creation of applications with which users will interact.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Templates for SPAs</h1>
			<p>SPAs is an amazing <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>architecture for web projects, where <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>all <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>the elements are rendered <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>using a single <strong class="bold">HyperText Markup Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">HTML</strong>) file. There are a good number of libraries and frameworks that use this concept – for example, Angular, React.js, and Blazor WebAssembly. </p>
			<p>Any project created with these templates will contain all the required components to create a monolithic application, using ASP.NET on the backend and a SPA library or framework on the frontend side. </p>
			<p>Let's create our <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>first SPA project with Visual Studio. You <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>can search for <strong class="source-inline">ASP.NET Core with</strong> to find the templates for SPAs:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer077" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.21_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.21 – Searching by ASP.NET Core with&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.21 – Searching by ASP.NET Core with</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 4.21</em>, you can see the result of searching by <strong class="source-inline">ASP.NET Core with</strong>. There are three templates that we can select to work with SPAs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">ASP.NET Core with Angular</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">ASP.NET Core with React.js </strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">ASP.NET Core with React.js and Redux </strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will create a project with React.js, so let's select <strong class="bold">ASP.NET Core with React.js</strong> and then click on <strong class="bold">Next</strong> to continue:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer078" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.22_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.22 – Configuring ASP.NET Core with the React.js project &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.22 – Configuring ASP.NET Core with the React.js project </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">This project that you will create is going to be used for the next exercises in this book, so it's important to save this code in a permanent folder that you prefer. </p>
			<p>Then, you should <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>select <strong class="bold">.NET 6 (Long-term support)</strong> as a <strong class="bold">Framework</strong> target <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>and <strong class="bold">None</strong> in <strong class="bold">Authentication type</strong>, and finally, click on <strong class="bold">Create</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.23</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer079" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.23_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.23 – Filling out the Additional information section&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.23 – Filling out the Additional information section</p>
			<p>After clicking on <strong class="bold">Create</strong>, you <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>can see the project created <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>with the SPA template and analyze the architecture:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer080" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.24_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.24 – The ASP.NET Core project with the React.js project created in Visual Studio&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.24 – The ASP.NET Core project with the React.js project created in Visual Studio</p>
			<p>There are three important <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>folders to highlight <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>in this template: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">ClientApp</strong>: Contains the client application – in this case, a React.js app</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Controllers</strong>: Contains all the controllers related to the business logic on a server</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pages</strong>: Contains razor pages, which means UI components rendered on a server</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The template has a demo with the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecastController.cs</strong> file. This is a simple demo that returns some random data.</p>
			<p>Let's run the project by clicking the play button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.25</em>, to see how the application looks:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer081" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.25_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.25 – The option to run the project in Visual Studio (the green arrow or play icon)&#13;tt&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.25 – The option to run the project in Visual Studio (the green arrow or play icon)</p>
			<p>When the <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>project is running, you can see a simple <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>HTML page explaining how the template works, which includes two demos, <strong class="bold">Counter</strong> and <strong class="bold">Fetch data</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer082" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.26_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 4.26 – ASP.NET Core with the React.js project running&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>The template is simple but includes everything that we need for creating a new web application using a monolithic architecture and best practices on the backend and frontend sides. If you require a web application with high-performance security, this template is a good option. React.js uses JavaScript in the syntaxes, so for this template, you need more <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>knowledge of this language and C# for the <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>backend. In the template that we analyzed in the <em class="italic">Templates for .NET Core</em> section, C# was more important than JavaScript for writing our UI and business logic.</p>
			<p>We will perform some modifications in this project, and we will use the files and demos by default to analyze the tools in Visual Studio and learn how to take advantage of these amazing functionalities. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Visual Studio has different options for creating projects, using templates depending on the workload added during the installation process. We have four filters to search quickly in the templates. Though we can filter by language, platform, and project type, we also have the possibility to use the search bar to find our template, using a term or a specific word. </p>
			<p>After selecting the template to use, we must always type a project name and the folder where our project is going to be created. Then, we must select the target framework and some optional information. Visual Studio is going to open the project after selecting <strong class="bold">Create</strong> on the screen, so we have the possibility to start working on our project right away. </p>
			<p>Using <strong class="bold">Solution Explorer</strong>, we can see the structure of the project, including the folders used in the application. Normally, a project created with a template contains a demo that helps us to verify whether an application is running fine.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B17873_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Debugging and Compiling Your Projects</em>, we will debug our created SPA project. We will understand why this tool is important, and we will check the options to compile our project before executing it. </p>
