- en: Unity might have a robust built-in component system, but it won't prevent you
    from having tight coupling issues in your code base. You want to make sure objects
    can communicate with each other without being bound together to the point that
    if one element is missing in the chain, everything breaks down. The patterns in
    this section are designed to help you decouple your dependencies and offer a way
    to write code that's more scalable.
