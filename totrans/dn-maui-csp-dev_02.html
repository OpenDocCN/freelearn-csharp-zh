			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>What We Will Build: Forget Me Not</h1>
			<p>During the course of this book, we will build the core of a complete non-trivial application called <em class="italic">Forget Me Not</em>. It is easiest to get somewhere when you know where you are going, so this chapter will review the finished product from a user’s point of view. That is, in this chapter, we’ll review the functionality, and in subsequent chapters, we’ll dive into the implementation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>This chapter does not review code (although all the subsequent ones will) and so there are no particular technical requirements for this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>What is Forget Me Not?</h1>
			<p>Forget Me Not™ is an<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> application designed to help you buy presents for your buddies and to allow them to easily buy presents for you.</p>
			<p>The core of Forget Me Not is your list of preferences, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.1</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.1_B19723.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Preferences&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – Preferences</p>
			<p>You fill in each field<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> with whatever and however much information you like. What’s more, you can change the prompt on the left and then fill in your new preference on the right! This gives you the maximum flexibility in specifying your preferences and your taste in various potential present categories.</p>
			<p>The power of this is seen once you have Buddies.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Buddies</h1>
			<p>If a friend or relative has the app, you <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>can invite them to be your Buddy. Once your relationship is<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> established in the cloud-based database, you can see your Buddy’s preferences, and they can see yours (though you cannot edit each other’s preferences).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Inviting Buddies</h2>
			<p>To invite a Buddy, you <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>navigate, using the tabs, to the Buddy list and tap on <strong class="bold">Add Buddy</strong>, which will bring up the <strong class="bold">Share</strong> page, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.2</em>.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.2_B19723.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – The Share page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – The Share page</p>
			<p>You can now use any of the platform-specific share options, including copying the invitation. Let’s send it as an email message, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.3</em>.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.3_B19723.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – Email invitation&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 – Email invitation</p>
			<p>The text of the invitation is canned and automatically provided, but the user can edit it at will. The <em class="italic">magic link</em> will be provided by the server for one-time access to the login page, to reciprocate the <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>connection to the inviting Buddy. Note that this will not be covered in this book as this work is done by the API.</p>
			<p>Those are the key pages, but there are a couple of others.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Other pages</h1>
			<p>In addition to these primary pages, there<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> is an <strong class="bold">About</strong> page, as shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.4_B19723.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – About page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 – About page</p>
			<p>Clicking on <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong> here<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> brings up the <strong class="bold">User Preferences</strong> page, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.5</em>.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.5_B19723.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – User Preferences&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.5 – User Preferences</p>
			<p>There isn’t that much <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>more to the app. While there are only half a dozen pages, those pages do a lot and will provide fertile ground for learning the basics and then going way beyond the essentials to cover intermediate and then advanced topics.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>What you’ll learn</h1>
			<p>Even just these <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>few pages will give us an opportunity to discuss virtually every aspect of .NET MAUI, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Shell navigation</li>
				<li>Layout</li>
				<li>XAML</li>
				<li>Controls</li>
				<li>Displaying collections</li>
				<li>The MVVM pattern</li>
				<li>Data binding</li>
				<li>Persisting data</li>
				<li>Consuming REST services</li>
				<li>Advanced topics in managing the UI</li>
				<li>Use of the Community Toolkit</li>
				<li>Behaviors</li>
				<li>Triggers</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the time you’re<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> finished reading this book, you will have two things: a working application and expertise in building .NET MAUI apps!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In the coming chapters, we’ll be building the Forget Me Not app as described in this chapter. The implementation of this seemingly simple app will allow us to explore core aspects of .NET MAUI and then move on to intermediate and ultimately advanced topics.</p>
			<p>As mentioned in <a href="B19723_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, each chapter (except this one) will end with a quiz to ensure that you are comfortable with what was covered and a <em class="italic">You try it</em> section where you will be encouraged to put your new skills to the test.</p>
			<p>I can’t wait to get started. Let’s begin with examining the markup language (XAML) and using C# for the logic of our program.</p>
