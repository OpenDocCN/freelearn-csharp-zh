    that it is possible to find out much more about this topic on the Internet. Nevertheless,
    I will try to explain how it looks from my perspective.

- en: '**Creative coding** is a relatively new term for a field that combines coding
    and design. The central part of this term might be the "coding" one—to become
    a creative coder, you need to know how to write code and some other things about
    programming in general. Another part—the "creative" one—contains design and all
    the other things that can be combined with coding.'

- en: Being skilled in coding and design at the same time lets you explain your ideas
    as working prototypes for interface designs, art installations, phone applications,
    and other fields. It can save time and effort that you would give in explaining
    your ideas to someone else so that he/she could help you. The creative coding
    approach may not work so well in large projects, unless there are more than one
    creative codes involved.

    the last few years. All of them are easy to use, but usually the less complicated
    a tool is, the less powerful it is, and vice versa.

    this chapter, we will learn what Cinder is and how to set it up on the two most
    popular operating systems—Mac OS X and Windows. If you have access to both and
    you want to do it as fast as possible, choose Mac OS X. It won't take much longer
    on Windows, if you have a good Internet connection.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we are up to some Cinder coding! Cinder is one of the most professional and
    powerful creative coding frameworks that you can get for free on the Internet.
    It can help you if you are creating some really complicated interactive real-time
    audio-visual piece, because it uses one of the most popular and powerful low-level
    programming languages out there—C++—and relies on minimum third-party code libraries.
    The creators of Cinder also try to use all the newest C++ language features, even
    those that are not standardized yet (but soon will be) by using the so called
    Boost libraries.

- en: This book is not intended as an A-to-Z guide about Cinder nor the C++ programming
    language, nor areas of mathematics involved. This is a short introduction for
    us who have been working with similar frameworks or tools and know some programming
    already. As Cinder relies on C++, the more we know about it the better. Knowledge
    of ActionScript, Java, or even JavaScript will help you understand what is going
    on here.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Setting up Cinder on Mac OS X is relatively easy if you have done some coding
    before—that means, if you have Xcode installed. If not, you have to download and
    install it. To do that get yourself an Apple Developer Account from [https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/](https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have your Apple Developer ID and password, go to the Xcode download
    section at [https://developer.apple.com/xcode/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
    or open up the App Store application and search for the Xcode application there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process of installing Xcode is not a topic that we will be covering in this
    book, but it should be quite self-explanatory as Apple has a long history of making
    their applications as user friendly as possible. If you encounter problems with
    installing Xcode, try Google or go to the official Apple Developer Xcode FAQ located
    at [https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/).
  prefs: []

    the downloaded Cinder package at a safe location, for example, `/Users/Your_User-name/cinder`.
    In my case, the path is `/Users/kr15h/cinder`.

- en: Next, we are going to test if our newly created setup is working by opening
    one of the sample applications. We will try out the QuickTime sample application.
    To do that open the file `quickTimeSample.xcodeproj` (`QuickTimeBasic.xcodeproj`
    in Cinder 0.8.5) in the `cinder/samples/QuickTime/xcode/` directory (`cinder/samples/QuickTimeBasic/xcode/`
    in Cinder 0.8.5). In Xcode, select **Build** | **Build and Run** (**Product**
    | **Run** on Xcode 4+). You can achieve the same effect by pressing *Cmd* + *R*
    or by clicking on the **Build and Run** (simply **Run** in Xcode 4+) button in
    the toolbar (you can recognize it by a round green play button that is placed
    over a grayscale hammer or a round gray play button in Xcode 4+).

- en: Setting up Cinder on Windows might take a bit longer than on Mac OS X. That
    does not mean that it will work slower though. The thing that is good about Windows
    PCs is that you can usually be more elastic with your hardware configuration.
    So, if you have a strong will to create some wicked generative stuff with the
    right kind of hardware you choose, go for Windows and equip yourself with some
    QuadCore CPU, SSD hard drive, and appropriate GPU. It won' t hurt.
  prefs: []

    have to download more stuff. Except the Cinder package, you also have to download
    and install the following.

    the same directory level (and with the directory name `QuickTimeSDK-7.3`) as Cinder
    itself. So, if you keep your Cinder in `C:\cinder`, the QuickTime SDK should reside
    at `C:\QuickTimeSDK-7.3`—change this while installing the SDK.
