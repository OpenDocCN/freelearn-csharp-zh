<p class="mce-root">Game development is a broad and complex task. It is an interdisciplinary field, covering subjects as diverse as artificial intelligence, character animation, digital painting, and sound editing. All these areas of knowledge can materialize as the production of hundreds (or thousands!) of multimedia and data assets. A special software application—the game engine—is required to consolidate all these assets into a single product. Game engines are specialized pieces of software, which used to belong to an esoteric domain. They were expensive, inflexible, and extremely complicated to use. They were for big studios or hardcore programmers only. Then, along came Unity.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Unity represents the true democratization of game development. It is an engine and multimedia editing environment that is user-friendly and versatile. It has free and Pro versions; the latter includes even more features. Unity offers deployment to many platforms, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Mobile:</strong> Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry</li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Web:</strong> WebGL</li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Desktop:</strong> PC, Mac, and Linux platforms</li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Console:</strong> PS4, PS3, Xbox One, XBox 360, PlayStation Mobile, PlayStation Vita, and Wii U</li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Virtual Reality</strong> (<strong>VR</strong>)/<strong>Augmented Reality</strong> (<strong>AR</strong>): Oculus Rift, Gear VR, Google Daydream, and Microsoft Hololens</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">Today, Unity is used by a diverse community of developers all around the world. Some are students and hobbyists, but many are commercial organizations, ranging from garage developers to international studios, who use Unity to make a huge number of games—you might have already played <span>some </span>on one platform or another.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book provides over 170 Unity game development recipes. Some recipes demonstrate Unity application techniques for multimedia features, including working with animations and using preinstalled package systems. Other recipes develop game components with C# scripts, ranging from working with data structures and data file manipulation to artificial intelligence algorithms for computer-controlled characters.</p>
<p class="mce-root">If you want to develop quality games in an organized and straightforward way, and you want to learn how to create useful game components and solve common problems, then both Unity and this book are for you.</p>

<p><a href="920700d7-96cd-4015-b17c-ee2451bc648e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Displaying Data with Core UI Elements</em>, is filled with <strong>User Interface</strong> (<strong>UI</strong>) recipes to help you increase the entertainment and enjoyment value of your games through the quality of the visual elements displaying text and data. You'll learn a wide range of UI techniques, including displaying text and images, 3D text effects, and an introduction to displaying text and image dialogues with the free Fungus package.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="831e50f7-9151-4b6e-94d6-d9ad8dd95acf.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="831e50f7-9151-4b6e-94d6-d9ad8dd95acf.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Responding to User Events for Interactive UIs</em>, teaches you about updating displays (for example basic on timers), and detecting and responding to user input actions, such as mouseovers, <span>while the first chapter introduced code UI for displaying values to the user</span>. Among other things, there are recipes for panels in visual layers, radio buttons and toggle groups, interactive text entry, directional radars, countdown timers, and custom mouse cursors.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="c6ad221f-b476-4471-8259-9ad448749a32.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Inventory UIs</em>, relates to the many games that involve the player collecting items, such as keys to open doors, ammo for weapons, or choosing from a selection of items, such as from a collection of spells to cast. The recipes in this chapter offer a range of text and graphical solutions for displaying inventory status to the player, including whether they are carrying an item or not, or the maximum number of items they are able to collect.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="8af9fc87-b511-451e-84a0-ee0a19a0cf16.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Playing and Manipulating Sounds</em>, suggests ways to use sound effects and soundtrack music to make your game more interesting.

<p class="mce-root"><a href="d06a465c-30e2-409e-b11d-bd0165997a46.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Using Cameras</em>, presents recipes covering techniques for controlling and enhancing your game's camera(s). It offers solutions to work with both single and multiple cameras, illustrates how to apply Post-Processing effects, such as vignettes and grainy gray-scale CCTVs. The chapter concludes by introducing ways to work with Unity's powerful Cinemachine components.</p>
<p><a href="67c7cc8b-128a-4055-a434-792b79005e0c.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Lights and Effects</em>, offers a hands-on approach to several of Unity's lighting system features, such as cookie textures, Reflection maps, Lightmaps, Light and Reflection probes, and Procedural Skyboxes. Also, it demonstrates the use of Projectors.</p>
<p><a href="2a783f24-2c25-48ed-9f22-ad07aefd3b84.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>2D Animation</em>, introduces some of Unity's powerful 2D animation and physics features. In this chapter, we will present recipes to help you understand the relationships between the different animation elements in Unity, exploring both the movement of different parts of the body and the use of sprite-sheet image files that contain sequences of sprite frames pictures. In this chapter core, Unity Animation concepts, including Animation State Charts, Transitions, and Trigger events, are also introduced. Finally, 2D games often make use of Tiles and Tilemaps (now features that are part of Unity), and these features, as well as the Unity 3D Gamekit, are all introduced in the recipes of this chapter.</p>
<p><a href="aabce932-14cb-4b65-b9fe-f67e5ea85186.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="aabce932-14cb-4b65-b9fe-f67e5ea85186.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <em>3D Animation,</em> focuses on character animation and demonstrates how to take advantage of Unity's animation system—Mecanim. It covers a range of subjects, from basic character setup to procedural animation and ragdoll physics. It also offers introductions to some of the newer Unity 3D features, such as Probuilder and the Unity 3D Gamekit.</p>
<p><a href="49e3f399-694d-4f8a-8e72-f0f3488a09de.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Webserver Communication</em>, <em>and Online Version Control</em>, explores how games running on devices can benefit from communication with other networked applications. In this chapter, a range of recipes are presented, which illustrate how to set up an online, database-driven leaderboard, how to write Unity games that can communicate with such online systems, and ways to protect your games from running on unauthorized servers (to prevent your WebGL games being illegally copied and published on other people's servers. In addition, the recipes illustrate how to structure your projects so that they can be easily backed up using online version control systems such as GitHub, and also how to download projects from online sites to edit and run on our own machine.</p>
<p><a href="eb0ea442-6350-4a86-9e16-708b80d8762f.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Controlling and Choosing Positions</em>, presents a range of recipes for 2D and 3D users and computer-controlled objects and characters, which can lead to games with a richer and more exciting user experience. Examples of these recipes include spawn points, checkpoints, and physics-based approaches, such as applying forces when clicking on objects and firing projectiles into the scene.</p>
<p><a href="76e8dff3-995e-4ffa-b75b-2a99949c8189.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Navigation Meshes and Agents</em>, explores ways that Unity's Nav Meshes and Nav Mesh Agents offer for the automation of <span>object and character </span>movement and pathfinding in your games. Objects can follow predefined sequences of waypoints, or be controlled by mouse clicks for point-and-click control. Objects can be made to flock together based on the average location and movement of all members of their flock. Additional recipes illustrate how the "cost" of navigation areas can be defined, simulating hard-to-travel areas such as mud and water. Finally, although much navigation behavior is pre-calculated at Design Time (the "baking" process), a recipe is presented illustrating how movable objects can influence path-finding at runtime through the use of the NavMesh Obstacle component.</p>
<p><a href="04f5a183-ae0b-4d73-8e78-c90fd75c9a64.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Design Patterns</em>, illustrates software design patterns that are reusable, and computer-language independent templates for how to solve common problems. It teaches to avoid reinventing the wheel, learn about tried-and-tested approaches to solving common features for game projects. This chapter introduces several design patterns relevant to games, including the State pattern, the publisher-subscriber pattern, and the model-view-controller pattern.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><a href="220b650d-33c4-4b4d-8ca4-9175943c8bb2.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 15</a>, <em>Editor Extensions and Immediate Mode GUI (IMGUI)</em>, provides several recipes for enhancing design-time work in the Unity Editor. Editor Extensions are scripting and multimedia components, which allow working with custom text, UI presentation of the game parameters, data in the Inspector and Scene panels, and custom menus and menu items. These can facilitate workflow improvements, allowing game developers to achieve their goals quicker and easier. Some of the recipes in this chapter include menu items, interactive panels with persistent storage, registering actions for the Undo system, deactivating menu items, progress bars, and ways to create new GameObjects based on prefabs.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Import file <kbd>arrowCursor.png</kbd> into your Unity project."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre style="color: black">using UnityEngine; 
using UnityEngine.UI; 

[RequireComponent(typeof(PlayerInventoryTotal))] 
public class PlayerInventoryDisplay : MonoBehaviour { 
   public Text starText; 
   public void OnChangeStarTotal(int numStars) { 
         string starMessage = "total stars = " + numStars; 
         starText.text = starMessage; 
   } 
}</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
