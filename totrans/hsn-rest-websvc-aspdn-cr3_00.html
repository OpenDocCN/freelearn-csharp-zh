<p>.NET Core is a breath of fresh air for all the consumers of the Microsoft ecosystem. The old ASP.NET and .NET framework both have a long history. Over the years, the growth of the .NET framework and the long-time support constraints have resulted in odd implementations and hard-to-maintain web applications and web services.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strong dependency between .NET framework and the Windows OS has led to substantial limitations in the cloud technology world. </p>
<p>.NET Core and ASP.NET Core are designed to evolve. They use abstract software development practices including open source, community-oriented approaches, as well as continuous improvement concepts. Today, ASP.NET Core is more flexible, fast, and powerful than ever. All the constraints developers had faced with .NET framework have been expelled and rewritten from scratch. Consequently, it is now possible to run .NET Core on every platform with no limitations. The framework is directly shipped with the .NET Core application. Therefore, it is possible to run it using a containerization approach. The documentation, the issues, and the roadmap are all available on GitHub.  Microsoft is now following, by default, an open source way of working. </p>
<p>I've been interested in .NET Core since the first release of the old DNX runtime. This book will introduce you to the power of ASP.NET Core and how to use its strength and flexibility to run web services. Furthermore, the book aims to fight the prejudices that people have regarding the .NET ecosystem and seeks to increase the adoption of .NET Core.</p>

<p>This book is intended for those who want to learn how to build RESTful web services with ASP.NET Core. To make the best use of the code samples included in the book, you should have basic knowledge of C#.</p>
