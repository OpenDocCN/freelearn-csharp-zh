<p class="mce-root">When it comes to <strong>GIS</strong>, which is the abbreviated form of <span><strong>Geographic Information Systems</strong>, and </span>data and usage in AR programming, it comes in many flavors and usages. However, before we get into how to use GIS data in AR games and applications, we must first understand what GIS actually is. So, we will go over things like: when GIS was developed, who the father of GIS is, where GIS can be used, and how GIS works with game and application development. The reason this is important is that the history of GIS plays directly into how data is used today in AR applications and games; it also allows us to appreciate the hard work of those in the past who made it possible for us to take advantage of readily available data online. We will go over some examples of how we can use what we have learned from the history of GIS to create applications and games later on in this chapter. The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding what GIS is</li>
<li>History of GIS and data analysis</li>
<li>GIS statistics</li>
<li>Implications of GIS</li>
<li>GIS and AR</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand what GIS actually is, we must dive a little deeper to discover the underlying principles of GIS and how it started. The history of GIS and data analysis is fascinating and will expose many things that allow us to understand the underlying structure of how it is set up and used. GIS statistics will allow us to be able to know which mathematical methods are commonly used so that we can take advantage of them. The implications of GIS will show us many uses of GIS, not only in academia, but also in education and real-world usage.</p>
<p>GIS and AR will show us some much-needed examples of how AR applications and games have incorporated GIS into them. This will give us a clear idea on what we could develop in the future.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>

<p>The most common definition of GIS is geographic information systems. It is comprised of a full software and hardware system that can capture geographic data and information via cameras, store it via a database, manipulate it via software, analyze it via statistical and visualization tools, and manage and present spatial or geographic data. There are other well-known defination for GIS, such as geographic information science, although that has fallen out of general use as it refers to the academic discipline that studies geographic information systems. It is not commonly used for the definition of GIS, because it is a large domain within the much broader academic discipline of geoinformatics.</p>
<p>This essentially boils down to the ability to describe any information system that can combine, keep for future usage, manage, examine, distribute, and manifest geographic information. In essence, you can create tools that allow for users or other tools to create two-way flows of informational queries, examine spatial data, manipulate and inspect map data, and showcase the results of all of these operations in either visual or data form.</p>
<p>There are many tools and a plethora of different applications related to the engineering, arrangement, administration, logistics, insurance, transport, telecommunications, and business of GIS, and due to all this, GIS and location intelligence applications are the foundations for many location-enabled services such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing Maps, Pokémon Go, and many more.</p>

<p>The first known use of the term "geographic information system" was by Roger Tomlinson in 1968. It was used in his paper called <em>A Geographic Information System for Regional Planning</em>, and because of this, he is commonly known as the "father of GIS".</p>
<p>The first known application for spatial analysis was in 1832 by a French geographer named Charles Picquet. He represented the 48 districts of Paris by halftone color gradients following the number of deaths incurred by the outbreak of cholera per 1,000 inhabitants.</p>
<p>John Snow was determined to find the source of a cholera outbreak in 1854. He attempted to find the source of the cholera outbreak in London’s Broad Street region by marking points on a map to depict where the cholera victims lived, and by connecting the cluster he found, he was able to link the source of the outbreak to a water source that was nearby. This was one of the first known effective employments of geographic procedures in the study of disease transmission.</p>
<p>In his map, he used bars to represent deaths that occurred at specified households; however, in his first map, there were several minor errors. One of these errors was the location of the Broad Street pump:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5f06df00-e11f-47e7-abc9-26f2f14c971a.jpg" style="width:22.00em;height:15.08em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The text in this image is not important. It gives a gist of John Snow’s first map</div>
<p>With the second map he published, he fixed his errors, which included the location of the pump:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b3ce5736-a62f-407a-adc4-bf18823dc149.jpg" style="width:23.25em;height:16.17em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The text in this image is not important. It gives a gist of John Snow’s second map</div>
<p>While essential components of geology existed beforehand in cartography, John Snow's guide was extremely remarkable. It was novel because of the way that he utilized cartographic techniques to portray as well as examine groups of geologically subordinate wonders. And because of this, John Snow is known to many as a pioneer in disease mapping, in which many of the concepts he established are still used today in conjunction with many other aspects of GIS by the <strong>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</strong> <span>(<strong>CDC</strong>)</span>.</p>
<p>By the early 20th century, we saw the advancement of photozincography (also known as heliozincography). Photozincography gave the ability for maps to be split into layers. This meant that each layer could hold information only relevant to that specific layer, such as vegetation, trees, or waterways. It was mainly used for printing contours, since drawing these was a very labor-intensive task and thus made this technique extremely useful for cartographers. Having conduits, trees, or vegetation on independent layers implied that they could be chipped away at without alternate layers there to confound the artist, or to cause issues when, say, structures were obstructing something that should have been checked. This is also still used today; one such usage is when marking the location of electrical lines that are underground, or water pipes for houses:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9e8fe500-eae5-4aba-8b01-ef9c37917984.png" style="width:33.58em;height:27.50em;"/></div>
<p>With photozincography, maps like this were initially drawn on glass plates but were later changed over to plastic film as there were numerous points of interest regarding plastic over glass. Plastic was lighter, required less space for capacity, was less fragile, and more. At the point when the greater part of the layers were done, they were joined into a solitary picture utilizing an extensive procedure camera. When color printing became available, the layers' conception was withal utilized for engendering separate plates for engendering each color.</p>
<p>The utilization of layers later became one of the main features of contemporary GIS, and the photographic process described is not considered to be a component of GIS itself as the maps were and are just images without any databases linked to them. Advancement of PC equipment that was impelled by atomic weapons prompted broadly useful PC mapping applications in the mid 1960s. In 1960, the world's first obvious operational GIS by the Federal Department of Forestry and Rural Development in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada was created.</p>
<p>This first obvious operational GIS was created by none other than Dr. Roger Tomlinson. This GIS was known as the <strong>Canada Geographic Information System</strong> (<strong>CGIS</strong>), and it was utilized to store, break down, and control the information gathered for the Canada Land Inventory. The Canada Land Inventory was an administration push to decide the land capacity for provincial Canada by mapping data regarding the dirt, horticulture, amusement, untamed life, waterfowl, ranger service, and land use at a size of 1 to 50,000. Due to the scale and the amount of information that needed to be stored, a rating classification factor was created to permit easier and more effective analysis.</p>
<p>While there were other computer mapping applications at the time, CGIS made massive improvements as it provided capabilities for overlay, measurement, scanning, and digitizing the map data. It was also able to support a national coordinate system that spanned the entire continent with coded lines as arcs. This meant that it had a true embedded topology and it stored the attributes and locational information in separate files. The utilization of overlays in advancing the spatial investigation of focalized geographic information is the motivation behind Tomlinson turning out to be known as the "father of GIS".</p>
<p>In 1964, Howard T. Fisher shaped the Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis at the Harvard Graduate School of Design (LCGSA 1965 – 1991), where a large number of essential hypothetical ideas in spatial information to be handled were produced. By the 1970s, seminal software code and systems were distributed by the LCGSA. These systems were SYMAP, GRID, and ODYSSEY; not only did these systems serve as sources for subsequent commercial development, but they themselves were distributed to colleges, research centers, and business conglomerates worldwide.</p>
<p>MOSS and GRASS GIS were two public GIS systems that were in development by the late 1970s. Roughly a few years later, in the early 1980s, new commercial vendors for GIS software emerged. Those commercial vendors were the Environmental Systems Research Institute, CARIS, MapInfo Corporation, ERDAS, and M&amp;S Computing, along with Bentley Systems Incorporated for CAD. These sellers were fruitful in having the capacity to fuse numerous new highlights and ways to deal with GIS programming, for example, consolidating the original ways to deal with the partition of spatial and characteristic data with second-age ways to deal with sorting out trait information into database structures and additionally fusing CGIS highlights.</p>
<p>The first well-known work area GIS item that was discharged for the DOS OS was known as the Mapping Display and Analysis System, and was released to the public in 1986. In 1990, MIDAS was ported to the Microsoft Windows platform and was renamed to MapInfo for Windows during that process. This marked the process of moving GIS from the research sector over into the business sector.</p>
<p>One critical note to include is that CGIS kept going great into the 1990s and had fabricated a substantial advanced land asset database in Canada. CGIS was created as a centralized server-based framework for the government as a commonplace asset for arranging and administration programming. Along these lines, it had the capacity to do mainland wide investigation of complex datasets, however, CGIS was never made accessible in the business market sphere.</p>
<p>At the turn of the 20th century, users were beginning to explore GIS data over the internet. This called for data and transfer standardization. All of this was caused by the rapid growth in various systems and, as such, showcased the flaw that there were many different systems that <span>used </span>very few similar methods or data formats and needed to be consolidated.</p>
<p>As of late, there is an ever-growing number of open source GIS packages that run on a range of operating systems and software that are very easily customized to perform specific tasks. Research institutes and hobbyists are making mapping applications and geospatial data readily available via the internet.</p>

<p>As stated in the previous section, GIS technologies heavily utilize digital information. There are quite a few different digital data formulation methods that are used. The most common method of data formulation, however, is digitization, for obvious reasons. Let’s take a quick step back and define digitization. Digitization is where you have a physical copy of a map or survey data and transfer it into a digital medium by means of CAD or similar programs that have georeferencing capabilities. With the abundance of orthorectified imagery devices such as satellites, aircraft, Helikites, and UAVs, heads-up digitizing is becoming the go-to resource by which geographic data is extricated.</p>
<p>Heads-up digitizing is copying via tracing geographic data directly on top of aerial imagery. Heads-down digitizing is the process of tracing the geographic form onto a separate digitizing tablet, and is the more traditional method.</p>
<p>GIS can reference any variable that can be located spatially and temporally. Areas or degrees in Earth spacetime might be recorded as dates and times of event with the x, y, and z facilitates speaking to longitude, scope, and height. These GIS directions may speak to other information for measured frameworks of temporospatial reference. These GIS coordinates may represent other data for quantified systems of <span>temporospatial</span> reference. Some examples of <span>temporospatial </span>references include film frame number, stream gauge station, highway mile markers, surveyor benchmarks, building addresses, entrance gates, street intersections, water depth sounding, and POS or CAD origin or units.</p>
<p><span>Temporospatia</span>l data recorded units that are applied can vary widely; this includes using the exact same data, and because of this, all Earth-based spatial-temporal location references are relatable to one another. This makes it so that, ultimately, all of these references are able to represent a real physical location or extent in spacetime.</p>
<p>GIS data represents real objects with digital data determining the mix. That data includes objects such as roads, land use, elevation, trees, waterways, highways, and so much more. These real objects are generally divided into two distinct abstractions: discrete objects and continuous fields. Discrete objects are those such as houses, and continuous fields are things such as rainfall amount and evaluations. There are two broad methods that are used to store data in a GIS for both kinds of abstractions mapping references that have become a tradition: raster images and vectors. Points, lines, and polygons are typically used to map location attribute references.</p>
<p>There is a new hybrid method for storing data that is currently being used, which is able to combine three-dimensional points with RGB information at each point. This is able to return a 3D colorized image. GIS thematic maps are becoming much more realistically descriptive in what they are able to show or determine.</p>
<p>There are some very popular GIS file formats that are used by different software applications, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shapefiles</li>
<li>Geopackage</li>
<li>World file</li>
<li>AutoCAD DXF</li>
<li>Cartesian coordinate system</li>
<li>ADRG</li>
<li>Binary files such as BSQ or BIP</li>
<li>DRG</li>
<li>ECRG</li>
<li>GeoTiff</li>
<li>JPEG2000</li>
<li>RAW</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Ways to capture GIS</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Capturing GIS data consumes most available time for those that are practitioners of GIS. As such, there are a variety of methods used to enter data into a GIS where it is stored in a digital format. All existing data that has been printed on paper or PET film is able to be digitized or scanned to produce digital data. This would be a good time to define what a digitizer is and does.<br/>
A manual digitizer is a modified graphics tablet that uses a special magnetic pen, stylus, or puck that delivers information into a computer to create a digital map. These are rather expensive, however, they are very useful for GIS digitization  (<a href="http://www.digitizerzone.com/calcomp-db6.html">http://www.digitizerzone.com/calcomp-db6.html</a>):</p>
<p>Digitizers can produce vector data as operator trace points, lines, and polygonal boundaries from a map. A scanner is able to scan the results into raster data, which needs to be further processed to produce vector data:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/864492d8-30ea-4e35-941f-acb73066369c.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"> <a href="https://largeformatscanners.com/large-format-technical-scanners.htm">https://largeformatscanners.com/large-format-technical-scanners.htm</a></div>
<p>Using survey instruments and a technique called coordinate geometry, the data can be directly entered into a GIS. GPS (global positioning systems) positions can also be collected and imported into GIS software. The current popular approach to data collection allows for field computers to edit live data via wireless connections or offline editing sessions.</p>
<p>The higher availability of lower-cost mapping-grade GIS with the ability of to-the-decimeter accuracy in real time enhances the ability to use field computers to edit the live data as well as positions collected by laser rangefinders. The advantage of using this technique is that it eliminates most of the postprocessing, importation, and updating of the data in the office after fieldwork.</p>
<p>More and more new technologies are being developed that allow users to create maps and conduct analysis in the field directly, which makes projects and mapping more efficient and accurate. Remote sensor data is an important if not critical role in data collection, which consists of sensors attached to a platform. These sensors include cameras, digital scanners, and lidar, and the platforms usually consist of aircraft and satellites.</p>
<p>In the mid 1990s, England created a kite and balloon hybrid called HeliKites. They pioneered the use of compact digital cameras as geoinformation systems for aerial GIS data collection. Aircraft measurement software is accurate to 0.4 mm and is able to link the photographs with the measurements to the ground. The advantage of using HeliKites is that they can be used over towns, railways, and roads, where UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) are banned from usage. Miniature UAVs such as drones have recently been used for aerial data collection. Most digital data is collected from aerial photographs currently.</p>
<p>There are soft copy workstations that are used to digitize features from stereo pairs of digital photographs. The stereo pairs of digital photographs allow for data to be captured in both two and three dimensions. Elevation is measured using principles of photogrammetry. If analog aerial photos are used, they must be scanned before they can be entered into a soft copy workstation, however, if a high-quality digital camera is used, then this step can be skipped.</p>
<p>Remote sensing from satellites is another important source used for spatial data. Satellites use different sensor packages to measure the reflectance from parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and/or radio waves. Remote sensing from satellites collects raster data that is further processed with different frequency bands; this allows for better identification of objects and areas of interest.</p>
<p>No matter the source of captured data, it is important to consider if the data is captured with relative or absolute accuracy. Choosing between relative or absolute accuracy influences how the information is interpreted and the direct cost to capture the data.</p>
<p>After the data has been entered into a GIS, the data usually requires editing. The editing ensures that errors can be removed or designates which portions of the data need to be further processed. Scanned maps may have blemishes on the source map that may need to be removed from the raster image. Vector data has to be made topologically correct before usage with advanced analysis.</p>

<p>Data restored by GIS software can be converted into different formats. GIS can convert satellite image maps into vector structures. This is done by generating lines around cells within the same classifications. They can also determine the cell spatial relationships, such as adjacency and inclusion.</p>
<p>Image processing can do much more advanced data processing. This technique was developed in the 1960s by NASA, and was further enhanced by the private sector. They can do two-dimensional Fourier transforms, contrast enhancements, false color rendering, and a plethora of other techniques. Since digital data is stored and collected in different ways, the data sources tend to not be compatible with one another. To solve this compatibility problem, software built upon GIS technologies must be able to convert geographic data from one to the other. GIS are able to do this because they employ implicit assumptions behind different ontologies and classifications that require heavy analysis. Object ontologies have become much more prominent as a consequence of <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> (<strong><span>OOP</span></strong>), which makes it more compatible with game development and sustained work by Barry Smith and his coworkers.</p>

<p>The Earth can be represented by various models, and all of them provide a different coordinate set for every point on the surface of the Earth. The simplest model assumes that the Earth is a perfect sphere, although we know it isn't. And as more measurements of the Earth have been accumulated, consequently, the models of Earth have become extremely sophisticated and accurate. There are models that have different data that apply to different areas of the Earth, which provides increased accuracy. NAD83 is a US measurement, and WGS84 (World Geodetic System) is for worldwide measurements.</p>
<p>There are clear but very minor differences between NAD83 and WGS84, besides one being worldwide and the other being US-based. WGS84 uses the WGS84 ellipsoid and has an error margin of less than 2 cm from the center of mass, whereas the NAD83 uses the Geodetic Reference System (GRS80) ellipsoid with an offset of about two meters. NAD83 uses points over the Northern American plate that do not change, and WGS84 uses points with respect to the average of stations all over the world and are not fixed. NAD83 has not changed since its inception; WGS84 has been revised to use a deviation of 105 m to +85 by the new EGM96 geoid. WGS84 is used by the US DOD (Department of Defense), and NAD83 is used by many other agencies within governments.</p>
<p>Although WGS84 and NAD83 have different parameters, the results have negligible effects during surveys. For example, the semi-minor axis has a difference of 0.00010482 between WGS84 and NAD83, and the inverse of flattening has a difference of 0.000001462 between the two. To better showcase this, let’s look at a comparison of the US map from the results of WGS84 and NAD83:</p>

<p>Spatial analysis allows us to better understand spatial relationships and patterns, which in turn allows us to better understand our world. Because of this, we are able to map where things are, how they relate to one another, what it all means for the environment, and actions to take to reverse any adverse effects we may cause. We are also able to find optimum routes, select sites for a plethora of different building projects, advanced predictive modeling, and so much more.</p>
<p>We can use the predictive modeling aspect to see how a forest fire would spread based on vegetation, dryness of the particular region, and wind. Not only that, but we could use it to find the optimal location for a store to be built that would likely attract the most customers.</p>
<p>Spatial analysis with GIS is a rapidly changing field. GIS packages are getting increasing amounts of analytical tools, which includes standard built-in libraries as well as optional toolsets and add-ons.  Original software suppliers have provided these in many instances, however, third parties have been providing and developing these as well in increasing amounts. Many products offer SDKs (software development kits) that are compatible with specific programming languages, scripting capabilities, and the ability to develop custom analytical tools.</p>
<p>The website Geospatial Analysis (<a href="http://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/">http://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/</a>) and the associated book written by Michael J de Smith, Michael F Goodchild, and Paul A Longley are able to provide a fairly comprehensive guide on the subject matter. The massive increase in availability has created a new dimension to business and spatial intelligence to be able to make the geographic and social network data available to everyone. Geospatial intelligence, which is commonly referred to as GIS spatial analysis, has become a key element in security in the real world.</p>

<p>When trying to relate wetland maps to rainfall amounts recorded at different points, it can be difficult to do so, especially in places such as airports, schools, and television stations. A GIS can be used to visualize two-dimensional and three-dimensional characteristics of the Earth’s surface. This also includes the atmosphere and subsurface from informational points as well. GIS can quickly generate map data from contour lines that have the ability to give the indications of differing amounts of precipitation. This type of map is called a rainfall contour map.<br/>
Many methods are able to estimate the characteristics of surfaces from limited point measurements and require a high level of sophistication to do so accurately. Two-dimensional contour maps that are created from the surface modeling precipitation points can be overlaid with any other map in GIS covering the same areas. This derived map is able to provide additional information; in this case, this would be the potential viability of water power as a renewable energy source. GIS can be used to compare many other renewable energy resource viability options for any geographic region.<br/>
Additionally, from a series of three-dimensional points, elevation contours can be generated from slope analysis, which would make it to easily define watershed locations by computing all the areas uphill from any point of interest. An expected line connecting the lowest points of successive cross sections along the course of a valley or river can be computed from elevation data as well.</p>
<p>From all of this, we are able to ascertain that there are five main steps in the data analysis process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Framing the question</li>
<li>Exploring and preparing the data</li>
<li>Choosing the methods of analysis and the tools</li>
<li>Performing the analysis</li>
<li>Examining and refining the results</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Framing the question:</strong> It is a good idea to frame the question to make the subsequent steps easier to go through, for example, frame the question in a manner that helps determine which GIS tools and methods will be used for analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Exploring the data:</strong> This step is known to be the most time-consuming, and you aren’t guaranteed to have all the data needed for the analysis. It is a good idea to know the data format that will be used, how current that data is, the scale and detail of the data, the coordinate system used, whether the data uses any geometry work with the analysis, whether the data has the attributes needed, and whether the data has any access or usage constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing the data:</strong> During this step, the data format to use will be extremely important to know as it will determine which set of tools will need to be used. Make sure the data is organized, the data is readily extractable, and there are no errors that occur when using the data in the tools that will be used.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing the methods of analysis and the tools to be used:</strong> The methods and tools should be readily and easily defined by the question framed. Generally, the question should have a direct one-to-one for the methods and tools, and having a simple diagram for the analysis is considered good practice. A simple example is provided in the following image:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/876581b9-f462-4961-afda-af1737035198.png"/></div>
<p><strong>Performing the analysis:</strong> Since diagramming is considered good practice, all that needs to be done here is to follow the tasks in sequence. The more complex the analysis, the more it may be necessary to create a model with ModelBuilder to automate the process, which will make it easier to change a parameter and run the model again for different scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Examining and refining the results:</strong> This step is just to look at the results and see if there are additional parameters missed in the original question and add some tweaks to better fit the original vision of the question.</p>

<p>GIS are able to recognize the spatial relationships that exist within stored spatial data as well as analyze said data. This allows for complex spatial modeling to be performed, studying the relationship between the properties of geometric forms that remain invariant, including adjacency, containment, and proximity. We can use this information to more accurately model and analyze the data.</p>

<p>All of this leads us to geometric networks. Geometric networks are linear networks of objects that can be used to represent interconnected features and perform spatial analysis on them. Geometric networks are composed of edges that are connected at junction points. This is extremely similar to graph theory, which is heavily used in mathematics and computer science:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8698afa9-3808-479b-b651-09d96fd0b42b.png" style="width:35.50em;height:21.00em;"/></div>
<p>As we can see from the screenshot, networks can have weight and flow assigned to the edges, which are used to represent various connected features more accurately. The general use case for geometric networks is to model road networks and public utilities such as electric and water networks. They are also used to plan for transportation networks, infrastructure modeling, and hydrological modeling.</p>

<p>Hydrological models in GIS provide spatial elements and analysis with variables such as slope, aspect, and catchment area. This includes terrain analysis, as it is fundamental to hydrology since water always flows down a slope. Slope and aspect can be used to determine the direction of a surface runoff and flow accumulation for streams, rivers, and lakes.</p>
<p>Areas of divergent flow also gives a clearer indication of boundaries regarding catchment. As flow direction and accumulation matrixes are created, queries can be performed to show dispersal areas. This allows for more details to be added to the model. This would be things such as roughness, vegetation types, soil types, evapotranspiration rates, and surface flow. All of this means that hydrological modeling is perfect for usage with environmental contamination research.</p>

<p>Dana Tomlin coined the term “cartographic modeling” in his PhD dissertation in 1983, and he later used it in the title of his book <em>Geographic Information Systems and Cartographic Modeling</em>, which was published in 1990.</p>
<p>Cartographic modeling is the process wherein thematic layers of the same area are produced, processed, and analyzed. It should be noted that Tomlin used raster layers, however, the overlay method can be used in most general situations. Operations on map layers are able to then be combined with the usage of algorithms to be incorporated into simulations or optimization models.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Map overlay is the combination of several spatial datasets to create a new vector output dataset. You can visualize this by stacking several maps of the same area. Another way to visualize this is to think of the Venn diagram overlay used in mathematics. There are three types of overlays – union, symmetric difference, and intersect overlay – that are used for different reasons, which will not discussed here as they fall outside the scope of this book:</p>
<ol>
<li>Union overlay is to combine geographic features and attribute tables of both inputs and output it to a single output</li>
<li>Intersect overlay is to define the area where both inputs overlap and retains a set of attribute fields for each</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Symmetric difference overlay is to define the output area that includes the total area of both inputs EXCEPT for the overlapping area</li>
</ol>
<p>Data extraction in GIS is very similar to a vector overlay with the ability to be used in either vector or raster data analysis. Instead of combining properties and features of both datasets, extracting the data can involve using a clip or mask to extract certain features of one dataset that are relevant to the other dataset.</p>
<p>Raster data analysis uses local operation on multiple raster datasets or map algebra. Map algebra has a function that combines the values of each raster’s matrix and can be coupled with another function that can weigh some inputs higher than others through an index model that reflects the influence of various factors from within a geographic phenomenon.</p>

                </header>

<p>Statistics is heavily used in GIS, and there is a special branch of statistics that deals with field data specifically. This special branch of statistics uses spatial data with a continuous index. It is able to provide methods to model spatial correlation and predict values at arbitrary locations, which is also known as interpolation.</p>
<p>When geographic phenomena are measured, the observation methods can dictate the accuracy of any analysis. There are limits caused by the nature of some data, where there is a constant or dynamic degree of precision that is always lost in measurement. This loss of precision is determined by the scale and distribution of the data collection.</p>
<p>When determining the statistical relevance of any analysis, the average has to be determined so that the points outside of any measurement can be included to their predicted behavior. Applied statistics and data collection methods have a limitation to predicting the behavior of particles, points, and locations, which causes them to not be directly measurable.</p>
<p>Interpolation is where a surface is created by raster datasets through the input of data collection at a certain number of sample points. There are, however, several different forms of interpolation, and each of them treats data differently, which is dependent on the properties of the dataset. When interpolation methods are compared, several points need to be considered. The first is whether or not that data source will change and whether exact or approximate data collection will be used. The next is whether a method is subjective, which essentially means whether human interpretation or objective interpretation methods will be used. Next is the nature of transitions between the points: are they gradual or abrupt? Finally, checking to see whether a method is local or global.</p>
<p>A global method utilizes the entire dataset to form the model, and a local method uses an algorithm to repeat for a small section of terrain. Interpolation is utilized as the fundamental technique for estimation because of the spatial autocorrelation rule, which says that information gathered at any position will have comparability to or impact over those areas inside its prompt region.</p>
<p>The mathematical methods to produce interpolative data are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital elevation models</li>
<li>Triangulated irregular networks</li>
<li>Edge finding algorithms</li>
<li>Thiessen polygons</li>
<li>Fourier analysis</li>
<li>Weighted moving averages</li>
<li>Inverse distance weighting</li>
<li>Kriging</li>
<li>Spline</li>
<li>Trend surface analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>Geocoding is interjecting the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> arrange spatial areas. These can be from road addresses or some other spatially referenced information, for example, ZIP codes, divide, and address areas. A reference topic is required to geocode singular locations, for example, a street centerline document with address ranges.</p>
<p>The individual address areas have verifiably been added, or assessed, by inspecting the address that goes along a street section. These are generally given in a table or database. The product will then place a spot around where that address has a place along the section of centerline. Geocoding can likewise be connected against genuine bundle information.</p>

<p>Reverse geocoding is the way toward restoring an expected road address number, as it identifies with a given facilitate. You can think about this like an invert telephone number look-into table. Also, similar to reverse phone look-into tables, switch geocoding does not return real road addresses, just the gauge of what ought to be there in light of a foreordained range. Combined with GIS, multi-criteria choice examination techniques bolster leaders in breaking down an arrangement of option spatial arrangements. MCDA utilizes choice tenets to total the criteria, which enables the elective answers to be positioned or organized. GIS MCDA may diminish expenses and time engaged with recognizing potential reclamation destinations.</p>

<p>The state of the Earth, this is the subsurface, environment and surface can be broken down by encouraging satellite information into GIS programming. GIS have enabled specialists to utilize the innovation to investigate the varieties of the Earth's procedures over days, months, years, and even decades. Vegetation wellbeing changes through the developing season can be reenacted to decide when a dry season would have the most serious effect in any given district. The outcomes can give a harsh measure of the soundness of the plants in a recreated district. Simply utilizing two factors and estimating them after some time enables analysts to decide separations in the decay of precipitation and the outcomes on the locale's vegetation.</p>
<p>The accessibility of advanced data with both local and worldwide scales empowers GIS innovation to make such examinations. Satellite sensors deliver pictures of a specific area of the Earth twice every day. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and AVHRR (advanced very-high-resolution radiometer) are two of numerous sensor frameworks utilized for examination of the Earth's surface. These sensor frameworks can recognize the measures of vitality reflected from the Earth's surface crosswise over different groups of the recurrence range for territories up to one square kilometer.</p>
<p>Not exclusively is time being incorporated into ecological examinations with GIS, however, the capacity to track and model the advancement of people and creatures all through their everyday schedules is being investigated. This can be seen with the Google and Facebook area benefits that track a man for the duration of the day for a considerable length of time, months, or even a very long time after use. This compose information creation and control could never have been conceivable without GIS and the extraordinary type of insights utilized. Organizers can, likewise, test strategy choices by utilizing spatial choice emotional supportive network by utilizing models to extend the information encased inside a GIS forward in time.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium's Semantic Web ended up being amazingly helpful for incorporating information issues in data frameworks through devices and advances that have been developing. These apparatuses and innovations have been proposed as methods for interoperability and information reuse among different GIS-based applications and take into consideration new examination mechanics.</p>
<p>A few arrangements of ideas and classes of this space to indicate formal and machine-clear particulars of their ideas and connections have been made. This takes into account GIS to center around the information rather than the language structure or structure of the information. Easier ontologies alongside semantic metadata measures have been recommended by the W3C Geo Incubator Group, particularly to speak to geospatial information on the web. One such case is GeoSPARQL, which is a Geographic Query dialect for <strong><span>Resource Description Framework</span></strong> (<strong><span>RDF</span></strong>) Data, in which there are different advancements that are based on RDF and give dialect to characterizing the real structure, for example, <strong><span>Web Ontology Language</span></strong> (<strong><span>OWL</span></strong>) and <strong><span>Simple Knowledge Organization System</span></strong> (<strong><span>SKOS</span></strong>).</p>
<p>GeoSPARQL was produced by the <strong>Open Geospatial Consortium</strong> (<strong>OGC</strong>) and has been bolstered by numerous people in the field and not restricted to the Ordinance Survey, United States Geological Survey, Natural Resources Canada, Industrial Research Organization, and Austrialia's Commonwealth Scientific. GeoSPARQL gives OGC literals, for example, <strong><span>Geography Markup Languague</span></strong> (<strong><span>GML</span></strong>) and WTK (surely understood content) and simple highlights, for example, RCC8 ( locale association analytics) and DE-9IM (Dimensionally Extended nine-crossing point demonstrate) give topological relationship and subjective thinking and, in addition, SPARQL expansion capacities and <strong><span>Rule Interchange Format</span></strong> (<strong><span>RIF</span></strong>) center derivation rules for questioning change and elucidation.</p>
<p>Later research comes about here, and can be found at the International Conference on Geospatial Semantics web workshop and International Semantic Web Conference.</p>

<p>GIS is ending up, to a great degree, well-known with basic leadership as of late, and researchers have started to look profoundly into the social and political ramifications of GIS. Similarly, as with any frame and information accumulation and examination, GIS is defenseless to be abused to misshape reality for political and individualistic pick up. The generation, circulation, use, and portrayal of geographic data has been contended to be generally identified with the social setting, and furthermore holds the potential for expanded native doubt in the administration.</p>
<p>Different points that are investigated intensely are regarding potential copyright infringement, oversight, and protection. Many in the field are more hopeful, and they trust that the social approach that many will adopt is to strategize GIS appropriation as an instrument for open cooperation.</p>

<p>Not only can GIS be used in the academic sector, but it can also be used in the real world very effectively. We have seen the rise of GPS apps, which have largely replaced traditional maps, apps that know your exact location, apps that can find a lost device or child, and so much more. By taking all of the topographical and statistical data that can be obtained, almost every sector in modern life has been or can be utilized for GIS data.</p>
<p>We can really see this from historical events; let's use the bubonic plague as an example. Unlike those in the past, we are armed with hindsight that is 20/20; we know that it was rats that spread the disease. Let's say we had all of the data that showcased the movement and travel information of the rats, which we could then have used to study their patterns and have a much more accurate description of where the plague started and how it traveled.</p>
<p>It doesn't stop there, since that is more on the academic approach as well. Let's say we want to track our own daily patterns within the last five years. We can use location data along with GIS to accurately depict our daily routine. We can move forward and also think about how we can use GIS to track our internet usage by creating a GIS specific for IP addresses that showcases how frequently and infrequently websites are accessed.</p>
<p>Then, there are video games; we can apply GIS to video games in a multitude of ways, from recreating terrain used in historic battle locations from all around the world, to creating a completely alien world from mixing GIS data from various planets and moons. But we could also use GIS to augment the reality around us by injecting GIS data into the camera to transform or recognize similar data from which it reads in real time.</p>

<p>At the turn of the 20th century, GIS was starting to be recognized as a tool for use in the classroom. GIS used in education has the benefit of being focused on the development of spatial thinking. The downside is that there is little statistical data to show the scope of the usage of GIS around the world, although countries that specifically have a curriculum that mentions GIS have expanded faster.</p>

<p>GIS has proven to be an organization-wide enterprise, and a highly enduring technology that continues to adapt how the local government operates on many tasks. Many, if not all, governmental agencies have adopted GIS technology as a method to better manage and improve upon many of their organizations, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Safety operations such as Emergency Operations Centers, Fire Prevention, Police and Sheriff mobile technology and dispatch, and mapping weather risks</li>
<li>Parks and Recreation departments and their functions in asset inventory, land conservation, land management, and cemetery management</li>
<li>Public Works and Utilities, tracking water and storm water drainage, electrical assets, engineering projects, and public transportation assets and trends</li>
<li>Fiber Network Management for interdepartmental network assets</li>
<li>School analytical and demographic data, asset management, and improvement/expansion planning</li>
<li>Public Administration for election data, property records, and zoning/management</li>
</ul>
<p>The Open Data Initiative has pushed the local government to take advantage of the technology and also share their own data with their requirements to fit the Open Data and Open Government model of transparency. Because of Open Data, local government organizations can implement their online portals which allow citizens to view and utilize this information. This push for open data from within and outside of government organizations has been a huge driving force for local government GIS tech spending and database management.</p>

<p>As discussed in the previous section, the application of GIS with augmented reality is only really hampered by your imagination, especially when you consider that there are tons of data types that you can utilize from GIS data. So, in the next section, we will go over and think of ways we can apply GIS to augmented reality applications and games.</p>

<p>As Richie Carmichael of the Esri Applications Prototype Lab said to Keith Mann in an online article (<a href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0311/augmented-reality-and-gis.html">http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0311/augmented-reality-and-gis.html</a>):</p>
<div class="packt_quote">“Imagine that you could point the camera on your phone at the ground and see the location and orientation of water pipes and electric cables buried under the ground because your AR app is cross-referencing the GIS system with your location and giving you a kind of x-ray vision so that you can visualize the infrastructure that is underneath you.”</div>
<p>This mindset has been reflected by many companies such as Google, Tencent, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and many more. China’s Tencent has done quite a few things with augmented reality and GIS. I think it is very worthwhile to go over some of the things China have done with AR and GIS.</p>
<p>China does not use Google’s services whatsoever and had to create their own search engine, which is called Baidu. This also means that they had to make mapping software which fully utilizes GIS. They created Baidu Maps, which works just like Bing Maps and Google Maps, however, they have added a slight twist to it. You can add a separate package for it that allows it to be easily used or integrated into AR applications.</p>
<p>By wearing smartglasses, it will project the map in front of you with the number of steps you have walked, and a first-person overlay of where you need to go to get to your destination.</p>
<p>They have also heavily integrated their social media platforms, QQ and Wechat, to work with their map software, which leads me to Wechat’s share real-time location function. It displays where you are and the location of the person you are trying to meet in real time, and updates with every step you take.</p>
<p>Google of course has Google Maps, which obviously works very similarly to Baidu Maps and Bing Maps. This leaves Apple Maps, which was the first to heavily integrate AI for auditory augmentation into their map service. AutoCAD and Blender are two programs that have the ability to read and manipulate GIS data. They can import shapefiles and create a 3D representation of the terrain, or export this as a specified file format. In AutoCAD’s case, it can export the data to XML, which can then be used to extract specific information that is wanted, such as population densities, or things along those lines.</p>
<p>AuGeo was made by Esri and it is a form of open source programming. This product enables you to control, download, and see information straightforwardly on a cell phone in a first-person view. AuGeo consolidates enlarged reality with GIS and shows highlighted information upon a live camera feed so that you can investigate your GIS information.</p>
<p>Augview, made by Augview Limited, is both a versatile GIS, enabling clients to see and alter their benefit information from the field, and an increased reality application, enabling clients to imagine underground protests they wouldn't normally observe. These are just a couple of players in the immense pool of organizations and applications that have been created to use, see, and/or control GIS information. Before we proceed, we should investigate a few applications that exploit GIS and augmented reality.</p>
<p>EyeMaps enables you to get data on a chosen dialect. Simply utilize camera mode to get thoughts about world around you. It immediately gives you names of mountains, urban communities, towns, exhibition halls, and much more. Take after connections to Wikipedia to get more data. Watch and offer your photographs on a 3D outline. This current application's primary highlights are making a 3D guide of your general surroundings while giving you data checks on it.</p>
<p>Vortex Planetarium is an excellent and simple application about everything in the sky. Huge amounts of information exists, including everything of the night sky substance, a large number of stars, groups of stars, messier articles, Caldwell items, and significantly more. This present application's fundamental highlights are exceedingly configurable substances. Set the straightforwardness of group of stars workmanship or tap the number of stars you wish to find in the night sky.</p>
<p>Plane Finder lets you see all air activity around the globe continuously. Interim the application gives you profoundly redid substance to set everything for your requirements. With Augmented Reality, you can recognize planes overhead with your gadget camera. The application additionally permits to set warnings when a plane shows up in the sky above you. This present application's fundamental highlights are that it works by getting ongoing ADS‐B signals. This innovation is speedier than a customary radar!</p>
<p>iOnRoad enables you to make a highly practical gadget from your cell phone. It offers help to you with GPS, activity checking, video and picture catching, and  considerably more. This present application's principal highlights are that it utilizes your gadget's local camera, GPS, and sensors to recognize vehicles before you, preparing drivers when they are in danger.</p>
<p>Dino around my work area AR amusement allows you to attempt to pet a virtual dinosaur. Inquisitive and adorable looking dinosaurs from ages past will meander around your work area. You may play with it by hand, or by tapping it in plain view of the screen. You may even sustain it. Be that as it may, whatever you do – remember, it has a voracious temper! This current application's principal highlights are that it enables you to play and find out about the ancient universe of dinosaurs.</p>
<p>The EmotionsAR application is for the individuals who saw vivified photographs in Harry Potter and constantly needed one for themselves. EmotionsAR furnishes you with a selective shot that enables you to make the photo come alive. What it would be? A short-energized photograph, or a long video story? That's for you to decide. This present application's principle highlights are that you can create your own particular photographs with AR video content!</p>
<p>Crayola Color Alive enables you to breathe life into your shading illustrations with vivid models that ascent up from the Crayola-lined pages. Spare your best characters to impart to your loved ones and utilize them whenever. This present application's principle highlights are that it has huge amounts of characters, enables you to print free pages, or obtained packs, at that point shading them and breathing life into them.</p>

<p>Gaming and GIS is a very interesting topic, and there are a multitude of ways to incorporate this idea with AR since AR has different ways of being implemented. To really showcase a prime example of incorporating GIS into games and applying a form of augmented reality, we need to look no further than the most well-known MMO of all time, World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>To set the stage, we first need to explain some of the features of World of Warcraft and what data modders have to work with. World of Warcraft has many different professions that you can do, and all of them require that you collect the materials necessary to craft the items. There are different types of cloth, ore, flowers, archeology spot locations, cooking recipes, and many different crafting recipes that can be found all throughout the world. And this is ignoring armor, weapons, randomly spawning rare mobs, and world boss locations that can be found through the world.</p>
<p>In order to incorporate GIS into World of Warcraft, people mapped the terrain of the world map or pulled the data from the data files in the game, mapped locations of everything that spawns all throughout the world, and abstracted them into different layers that correlate with what they reference. Then, they overlay them over the world map and attach them to the mini map to show where they are while playing the game with the mod enabled.</p>
<p>As you can see, augmented reality doesn’t just apply to the real world, but also the fantasy world as well. This makes AR very versatile, especially when you can find ways to incorporate GIS into it. Next up, let’s take a look at some pure AR games that focus on the real world. The primary game we will look at is GeoGuessr. GeoGuessr began as a little web application that gives you the test of speculating the areas of a progression of irregular Street View pictures. After you've made your guess, it uncovers the genuine area and honors focuses in view of how close you get.</p>
<p>The next game we will look at is Pursued. It is a sought-after shockingly fun Street View amusement game from Hungarian diversion designers Nemesys Games. The fundamental subject of the diversion is as per the following: "You've been taken all of a sudden. A companion is endeavoring to help you; however, you should make sense of where you are!" The point of the amusement is to guess the name of the city you take a gander at and type the name in the textbox as quickly as possible. In case you can't guess by the visual pieces of information in the Street View, you can move around by clicking in the Street View picture and utilize your '+' and '-' keys to zoom in and out.</p>
<p>Third on the rundown is Smarty Pins. Smarty Pins is a game created by Google Engineers. The point is to discover the response to an inquiry and stick point this area on the guide. For instance, you would get the inquiry "Where is the most seasoned British college?" and you would need to put a stick on Oxford. The main inquiries are normally situated in a player's nearby nation or are identified with extremely well-known places or individuals, however, as you advance, the playing board grows to whatever is left of the world and gets more challenging.</p>
<p>Guide Race is number four on the rundown. The thought behind it is to demonstrate to you a satellite photo of an area and four possible answers. The challenge is to choose the right answer at the earliest opportunity. In the event that you guess the wrong city, you'll get more opportunities to fathom it, which is terrible.</p>
<p>Number five is MapsTD. MapsTD is a pinnacle barrier game that utilizes Google Maps to create levels from any area over the world. Your undertaking is to safeguard your palace from assailants by deliberately putting and dealing with your guard towers. It's a truly standard pinnacle protection setup, yet the delight originates from doing it crosswise over true lanes and areas.</p>
<p>Number six on the rundown is Build. It is an impact of coordinated effort of Google and LEGO to exhibit potential outcomes of Google Chrome. It let clients build anything they can envision with virtual LEGO, put it on Google Maps, and offer their manifestations to the world. As the name suggests, it only works in Google Chrome.</p>
<p>Geo Guns is a tank shooting game and is number seven on our rundown. The diversion takes a full preferred standpoint of Google Maps' 45° (Bird's Eye) satellite view. It overlays a few tanks on the satellite picture. Your assignment is to crush the enemy tanks. You can browse various preset war zone areas for your tank battle, yet you can choose any area by entering an area on the highest point of the screen.</p>
<p>Find Street is a StreetView-based game and is number eight. It gives you a progression of irregular Street View scenes. Your assignment is to make sense of the area of each picture and pick the right test reply. As you can see, you can very easily utilize GIS, georeferencing, and AR in your games all at the same time, or by utilizing various aspects of each of these to create them.</p>
<p>The key things to keep in mind and remember are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Map design and the player interactions with maps are an essential part of the undertaking of creating a video game.</li>
<li>The game's appearance, graphics-wise, therefore sets its tone just as much as the control experience, insecurity, exploration, or plot do.</li>
<li>In competitive titles, the map represents the playing field. Every corner, every little modification, is crucial, as the players take their positions based on that. Monitoring this positioning is a must for the winning team.</li>
<li>In open map titles, the game experience often exceeds the information provided by the maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>These items are critical for determining which approach best fits the idea and structure you want to implement.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we discussed the history of GIS, how GIS data is collected, how GIS data is used, GIS applications, GIS games, and how to incorporate GIS into augmented reality applications and games. There were many more interesting bits of information provided, such as the data formats and how they changed with time; we learned that GIS has many applications, both in the past and in the present for statistics and analysis, that will most likely continue to be used in the future here on Earth and on other planets, as we are starting to see with Mercury, Venus, Mars, and our Moon.</p>
<p>GIS is a broad field that has the ability to be applied in many different ways and for a variety of purposes, and in learning the basic fundamentals of GIS and its history, we can now apply that information to the games and applications we create. In the next chapter, we will learn about sensors and plugins with Unity.</p>
