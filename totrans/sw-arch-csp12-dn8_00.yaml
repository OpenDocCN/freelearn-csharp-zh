- en: This book will help you to understand the product that your customer wants from
    you. It will guide you to deliver and solve the biggest problems you may face
    during development. It also covers the dos and don’ts that you need to follow
    when you manage your application in a cloud-based environment. You will learn
    about different architectural approaches, such as layered architectures, onion
    architecture, service-oriented architecture, microservices, single-page applications,
    and cloud architecture, and understand how to apply them to specific business
    requirements.
