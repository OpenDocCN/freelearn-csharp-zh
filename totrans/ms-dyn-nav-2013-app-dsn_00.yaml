- en: In 1997, the company I worked for was looking to replace their MS-DOS-based
    software package. We were very fortunate in finding Navision Financials 1.1 as
    a software package that supported the upcoming Windows platform and was flexible
    enough to be implemented, supporting our demands.

    the structure of the application design was simple and solid and has not changed
    since then.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the years after that, more companies embraced Navision as their answer to
    the changing demands in the market, and many vertical solutions that still exist
    today started their life cycle. With the acquisition of Navision by Microsoft,
    the interest of new partners grew into the channel we know today.

    be fully used once you understand how the standard application parts are designed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When properly licensed, everyone can change how the application works. With
    this great possibility comes great responsibility as this means that we can also
    easily break important business logic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This results in a unique need for a designer of applications that run inside
    Microsoft Dynamics NAV to know more about the application without going into deep
    functional details.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The balance in this book will be between learning and understanding how the
    standard application features of Microsoft Dynamics NAV are designed, and how
    to use this knowledge when designing our own solutions. The area between understanding
    the application functionality and technical design is very thin.

    new solutions. We will also discuss how Microsoft Dynamics NAV can work with other
    applications.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction to Microsoft Dynamics NAV"),
    *Introduction to Microsoft Dynamics NAV*, will introduce you to Microsoft Dynamics
    NAV. We will briefly talk about the history of the application and talk about
    the concepts. We will cover some of the basic design patterns such as Number Series
    and Navigation. Then we will discuss the data model principles used by Microsoft
    Dynamics NAV using master data, journals, and ledger entries covered by documents.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. A Sample Application"), *A Sample Application*,
    will implement the theory you learned in the first chapter in a sample application.
    The goal of this chapter is to better understand how Journals and Ledger entries
    work throughout the system, and how to create your own Journal application. You
    will learn how to reverse engineer the standard application to learn from it and
    apply this to your own customizations. We will integrate the application with
    relationship management and sales in Microsoft Dynamics NAV, and extend Navigation
    and Dimensions for our solution.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Financial Management"), *Financial Management*,
    will explore how the financial management part of the application can be used
    and how it is designed. This is the heart of Microsoft Dynamics NAV. You will
    learn important concepts such as VAT and TAX, posting groups, closing dates, entry
    application, and financial data analysis. We will make some changes in the core
    application, adding new information to the general ledger, and learn how to integrate
    financial management into our add-on solution.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Relationship Management"), *Relationship
    Management*, will help you to analyze the sales data in our system and be more
    productive towards your customers. We will explore the unique design of this part
    of the application and integrate this with the sample application we created in
    [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. A Sample Application"), *A Sample Application*.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Production"), *Production*, will show us
    how to set up Microsoft Dynamics NAV for production companies. These companies
    are at the start of the supply chain. We will discuss the assembly management
    and manufacturing. Item Costing and Item Tracking are the key elements when using
    this part of the application. We will look at the planning worksheet, and how
    to create production orders using Make-to-Order and Make-to-Stock policies. We
    will reverse engineer the Inventory Profile Offsetting codeunit and see how this
    leads to planning and purchase orders. At the end of this chapter, we will look
    at ten ways to customize production for vertical industries.'

    between sales, inventory management, and purchasing, and how warehousing can be
    involved using different levels of complexity. Without sales, most companies will
    not survive. We will learn how reservation entries are used in the system from
    a technical perspective.'

    will design and build a solution for planning routes for shipments, a feature
    that is not available in Microsoft Dynamics NAV. We will design a solution that
    can be used by trading companies not only for their own shipments but also for
    storage companies. The solution is seamlessly integrated with the Dynamics NAV
    product. We will extend the Journal knowledge that we learned in [Chapter 2](ch02.html
    "Chapter 2. A Sample Application"), *A Sample Application* and [Chapter 3](ch03.html
    "Chapter 3. Financial Management"), *Financial Management*, with new document
    structures we learned in [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Production"), *Production*

    with an issue registration and timesheet application using resource groups and
    calculations. The Jobs functionality in Microsoft Dynamics NAV can be compared
    to an add-on solution. It was designed outside financial management and trade
    but is still integrated into the product.'

    We will show you which technologies are available to use for interfacing and how
    these technologies are implemented in the standard product. We will discuss all
    the built-in interfaces with other Microsoft applications such as Office, SharePoint,
