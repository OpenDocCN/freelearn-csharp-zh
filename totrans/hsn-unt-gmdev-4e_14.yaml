    We will be discussing particle systems, which are a way to simulate fire, waterfalls,
    smoke, and all kinds of fluids. We will see two Unity particle systems to create
    these kinds of effects, **Shuriken** and **Visual Effect (VFX) Graph**, the latter
    being more powerful than the first but requiring more hardware. These technologies
    are used widely in different games to simulate all kinds of effects, like explosions
    and gun muzzles in war games such as Battlefield or magic effects, as in Hogwarts
    Legacy.

    that can’t be skewed, bent, or deformed in any way other than by using shaders.
    Fluids such as fire and smoke can’t always be represented using this kind of mesh,
    but we can simulate these effects with a combination of static meshes, and this
    is where particle systems are useful.

    This has both pros and cons. A pro is that it can run on all possible devices
    that Unity supports, regardless of their capabilities (all of them have CPUs),

    with the number of particles we emit.

- en: '**Visual Effect Graph** is a GPU-based particle system solution, meaning that
    the system is executed in the video card instead of the CPU. That’s because video
    cards are far more efficient at executing lots and lots of little simulations,
    like the ones each particle of a system needs, so we can reach far higher orders
    of magnitude in the number of particles with the GPU than we can with the CPU.
    The con here is that we need a fairly modern GPU that has **compute shader** capabilities
    to support this system, so we will exclude certain target platforms using this
    system (forget about most mobile phones), so use it if your target platform supports
    it (mid- to high-end PCs, consoles, and some high-end phones).'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So far, we have used lots of Unity features that were already installed in our
    project, but Unity can be extended with a myriad of plugins, both official and
    third-party. Visual Effect Graph is one of those features that needs to be independently
    installed if you are using **Universal Render Pipeline** **(URP)**. We can do
    that using **Package Manager**, a Unity window dedicated to managing official
    Unity plugins.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Something to think about when you are installing those packages is that each
    package or plugin has its own version, independent of the Unity version. That
    means that you can have Unity 2022.1 installed, but Visual Effect Graph 13.1.8
    or whatever version you want, and you can actually update the package to a newer
    version without upgrading Unity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is important because some versions of these packages require a minimum
    version of Unity—for example, Visual Effect Graph 13.1.8 requires Unity 2022.1
    as a minimum. Moreover, some packages depend on other packages and specific versions
    of those packages, so we need to ensure we have the correct versions of every
    package to ensure compatibility. To be clear, the dependencies of a package are
    installed automatically, but sometimes we can have them installed separately,
    so in that scenario, we need to check the required version. It sounds complicated,
    but it is simpler than it sounds.

    the nodes inside the dotted area, and in this case, we have **Initialize Particle**,
    **Update Particle**, and **Output Particle Quad**. Each Context represents a different

    Context to move the initial particle position, but if we use the same block in
    the **Update Particle** Context, it will move the particle constantly. So basically,
    Contexts are different situations that happen in the life of the particle, and

    **Spawn**. This Context is responsible for telling the System that a new particle
    needs to be created. We can add blocks to specify when the context will tell the
    system to create the particle, such as at a fixed rate over time, bursts, and
    so on. The idea is that **Spawn** will create particles according to its blocks,
    while a System is responsible for initializing, updating, and rendering each of
    them, again, according to the blocks we set up inside each one of those Contexts.

    to use them via scripting to achieve effects that react to what’s happening in

- en: Visual feedback is the concept of using different VFX, such as particles and
    VFX Graph, to reinforce what is happening. For example, say right now we are shooting
    our weapon; we know that this is happening because we can see the bullets. However,
    it doesn’t feel like a real shooting effect because a proper shooting effect should
    have a muzzle effect on the tip of our gun. Another example would be the enemy
    dying—it just disappears with no animation! That doesn’t feel as satisfying as
    it could be. We can instead add a little explosion (considering they are robots).

    module). Feel free to use the same one we did previously in this chapter.

    In that case, you are assuming that anything to do with life will spawn a particle
    when dying, but consider scenarios where characters die with a falling animation
    instead, or maybe an object that just despawns with no effect whatsoever. If a
    certain behavior is not used in most scenarios, it is better to code it in a separate
    optional script to allow us to mix and match different components and get the
    exact behavior we want.
