			<p>Every new Visual Studio version brings new features to improve user experience and performance and provides more functionalities and tools for developers. </p>
			<p>We are just starting with Visual Studio 2022. In this book, you will learn some features with medium and high complexity, and in later chapters, we will study the changes in Visual Studio 2022 in more detail to get a deeper understanding. But in this chapter, we will review the most important features available in Visual Studio 2022 that you can use now. </p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will recognize the main differences between Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2022 and the most relevant improvements in this new version. </p>
			<p>We will review the following improvements in Visual Studio 2022: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>64-bit architecture</li>
				<li>New icons and styles</li>
				<li>.NET 6 support</li>
				<li>Hot Reload</li>
				<li>Other improvements</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>For this chapter, you will need to have Visual Studio 2022 already installed on your machine. In <a href="B17873_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Visual Studio 2022</em>, you can check the requirements and the installation process. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>64-bit architecture</h1>
			<p>A simple but important<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> feature in Visual Studio 2022 is the new architecture in 64 bit. This is a change that we cannot see, but internally, it takes advantage of a 64-bit CPU to improve the performance and reduce delays in the execution of multiple tasks.</p>
			<p>Visual Studio 2022 only supports a 64-bit system; this is something common in current laptops and PCs.</p>
			<p>Using <strong class="bold">Task Manager</strong> in Windows, you will be able to notice the difference when Visual Studio 2019 and 2022 are running at the same time:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.1_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – Visual Studio 2022 on the 64-bit platform and 2019 on the 32-bit platform"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – Visual Studio 2022 on the 64-bit platform and 2019 on the 32-bit platform</p>
			<p>With a 32-bit architecture, there was an access limitation of 4 GB of memory. Now, thanks to a 64-bit architecture, it is possible to access a larger amount of memory, reducing time limits and avoiding IDE freezes or crashes. </p>
			<p>All in all, the Visual Studio development team improved the performance for many scenarios in version 2022. You will notice the difference when working on large projects, and performance will be better in future versions. </p>
			<p>64 bit is a good improvement<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> for performance, but this feature doesn't improve user interaction while coding. In the following section, we will see how the icons and style were improved to have a better user experience.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>New icons and styles</h1>
			<p>New icons and styles<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> were added in Visual Studio 2022. Although this is a simple<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> feature, it helps us to navigate easily in an application, using visual elements and identifying actions and tools properly. For instance, in <em class="italic">Figure 3.2</em>, you can see the broom icon (row one, column five) has better contrast, with a new vibrant yellow color (specifically for a dark theme) and a modern design. It also implies that a code cleanup will be executed. The broom icon is used to execute code cleanup to fix code formatting:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.2_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Icons in Visual Studio 2022 versus 2019&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – Icons in Visual Studio 2022 versus 2019</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">An interesting fact about the new icons in Visual Studio 2022 is that the Visual Studio development team worked with the developer community to fulfill three purposes – consistency, readability, and familiarity. This resulted in a series of icons with the same meaning but with consistent colors, sharp contrast, and a recognizable silhouette.</p>
			<p>The contrast between<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> letters, icons, and background was improved to make<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> it more pleasant and less tiring for the eyes. In <em class="italic">Figure 3.3</em>, you can see an example:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.3_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – An example of a dark theme in Visual Studio 2019 (left) versus 2022 (right)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – An example of a dark theme in Visual Studio 2019 (left) versus 2022 (right)</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">While the use of dark themes is becoming more common among developers in general, it is also becoming more prevalent in applications across the industry.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Figure 3.4</em> is another example of using the blue theme. Although the colors are very similar, we can see some differences and how the screen looks better with the new icons:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.4_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – An example of a blue theme in Visual Studio 2019 (left) versus 2022 (right)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – An example of a blue theme in Visual Studio 2019 (left) versus 2022 (right)</p>
			<p>There are also some changes<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> in the other themes, but dark and blue<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> were the most improved. </p>
			<p>With these new icons and styles, working with Visual Studio becomes more user-friendly. In the next section, we will see how Visual Studio supports the new version of .NET, .NET 6. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>.NET 6 support</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">.NET</strong> is a free, open source framework<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> used to create web, desktop, mobile, and other kinds of applications, using C#, F#, and Visual Basic (with C# being the most popular one).</p>
			<p>A new version of .NET has been released every year. .NET 6 is a new<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> long-term support version, which offers great new improvements, such as minimal APIs and C# 10 compatibility. For more<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> information about the improvements, you can visit <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-6">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-6</a>.</p>
			<p>Visual Studio 2022 is ready to create, compile, and publish projects using this new version.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B17873_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Projects and Templates</em>, we will analyze the projects and templates provided by Visual Studio and look at the option to choose .NET 6 for our applications. </p>
			<p>We can create projects using .NET 6, but we<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> can also use a new functionality for quickly checking the code changes. In the next section, we will review how Hot Reload can improve our productivity while using Visual Studio 2022.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Hot Reload</h1>
			<p>For a long time, <strong class="bold">Hot Reload</strong> was the main requested<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> feature in the .NET developers' community. This is a feature already implemented in many technologies and expands a developer's productivity by refreshing an application after every change made to code. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Hot Reload is a feature that recompiles code after a change is made to it. This way, an application displays visual changes immediately without the need to restart it, significantly increasing productivity.</p>
			<p>Even external companies are working on this feature; one of the most popular is LiveSharp, which offers a monthly subscription (at the time of writing). You<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> can check it out at the following link: </p>
			<p><a href="https://www.livesharp.net/">https://www.livesharp.net/</a></p>
			<p>Visual Studio 2022 includes this amazing feature for many kinds of projects, including ones involving ASP.NET and Blazor (by creating web apps using WebAssembly and Razor components):</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.5_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – The Hot Reload button in Visual Studio 2022&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – The Hot Reload button in Visual Studio 2022</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The team behind Hot Reload decided not to support the new Hot Reload feature in <em class="italic">Xamarin.Forms</em> based projects for Android and iOS scenarios, so it is recommended to perform a migration to .NET MAUI to use this feature.</p>
			<p>In later chapters, we will<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> use this utility in some demos and learn why this tool is very important for us. In the next section, we will share other improvements that can help us to increase our productivity, especially in larger projects. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Other improvements</h1>
			<p>Visual Studio 2022 has other <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>improvements, one of which is performance. Visual Studio  2022 runs on 64 bit, but in addition, features such as the search file tool were improved to help find elements quickly in a project with a large number of files. In the following diagram, you will see a search example: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.6_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6 – An example of searching for the word &quot;class&quot; in Visual Studio 2022&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – An example of searching for the word "class" in Visual Studio 2022</p>
			<p>Also, you have a new type<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> of breakpoint (<em class="italic">a breakpoint is a technique to stop application execution in a specific line of the code</em>). With this<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> feature, we can add a breakpoint that depends on another created before. We will see more information about this feature in <a href="B17873_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Debugging and Compiling Your Projects</em>. In <em class="italic">Figure 3.7</em>, you can see the new <strong class="bold">Insert Dependent Breakpoint</strong> option:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.7_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 3.7 – The dependent breakpoint in Visual Studio&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – The dependent breakpoint in Visual Studio</p>
			<p>This is a new type of breakpoint<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> that is very useful<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> for debugging large applications with high complexity. It will interrupt the execution of your application when a previous breakpoint meets a condition. </p>
			<p>Regarding Git integration, we have a new experimental<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> feature that helps us to work with multiple repositories in the same solution. Thus, you can perform changes in different projects and then commit the changes (save the changes in Git) without opening multiple instances of Visual Studio. In <em class="italic">Figure 3.8</em>, the new option to enable multiple repositories is shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.8_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8 – In Tools | Options | Preview Features, there is a new option to enable multi-repo support&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.8 – In Tools | Options | Preview Features, there is a new option to enable multi-repo support</p>
			<p>We will analyze this feature deeper in <a href="B17873_11_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor130"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Git Integration</em>, where we will use a repository in GitHub to try functionalities related to the integration with Git and GitHub. </p>
			<p>Finally, IntelliCode is undoubtedly<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> one of the major changes<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> introduced in Visual Studio 2022, allowing developers to program with confidence, find problems quickly, and have focused code reviews by suggesting items that are most likely to be used at the top of a to-do list, as you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 3.9</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.9_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 3.9 – IntelliCode suggesting the properties and methods that are most likely to be utilized&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9 – IntelliCode suggesting the properties and methods that are most likely to be utilized</p>
			<p>We will get to know all the features<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> of this fabulous addition in <a href="B17873_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor088"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Coding Efficiently with AI and Code Views</em>, which will allow you to fully<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> explore the use of IntelliCode.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we provided an overview of the main improvements in Visual Studio and some differences between Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio 2019. Throughout this book, we will analyze these features further and use them in some demos.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B17873_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a><em class="italic">,</em> <em class="italic">Creating Projects and Templates</em>, you will create your first project and analyze the templates provided by Visual Studio for different programming languages and technologies. </p>
