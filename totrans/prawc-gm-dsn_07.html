<div><p class="calibre_1">Prototyping</p><p class="calibre_2">At this point in the book, you might have realized that, practical as it may be, game design happens in the designer's head first, on a document of some sort second, and only in a third step is it possible to implement it.</p><p class="calibre_2">To actually make the game happen, the designer has to get their hands on a tool that allows them to create working software; to write some code. Not all game designers are programmers, and even if they know how to program, designing and programming are two different jobs both requiring a person's full attention (and the bigger the project, the more this truth cannot be bent).</p><p class="calibre_2">There is one activity where a game designer is required to turn the design into a playable thing as if he was the only person working on it. This is the quintessence of practical game design.</p><p class="calibre_2">This is the creation of a game prototype.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">What is a prototype?</p><p class="calibre_2">A prototype is a model built to prove a concept.</p><p class="calibre_2">This definition is applicable to anything really, not only games. Most of the products we use every day, from the keyboard I am typing on to the complex machines that can fly outside the Earth's atmosphere and reach other planets, all of these things are the result of endless designs, prototypes, iterations, and failures.</p><p class="calibre_2">Game prototypes are not meant to be representative of what the entire game will look like; in that case, we talk more about tech demo or pre-alpha development builds. If you have a pre-alpha ready, that means you are at a later stage of the development and you have probably already prototyped your core mechanics to get to the pre-alpha stage. Nonetheless, even at later stages, you might need to address problems that were not obvious before. Maybe finally feeling how your game actually plays in the hands of a playtester—or even your own—raises questions about something you could have done differently or better.</p><p class="calibre_2">Prototyping ultimately means answering those questions. It is crucial to nail down what those questions are as early as possible.</p><p class="calibre_2">They could be generic questions, such as Would this work?, Would this be more interesting?, or Which one is the best? We will be more specific later, but for now, keep this in mind: if you don't have a clear question, why are you prototyping? And how will you be able to tell whether the prototype is working or not?</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Why a prototype?</p><p class="calibre_2">The main reason why prototypes exist is that we need to narrow down the risk of making something that doesn't work. Imagine that you have infinite time and resources; what would be the point of creating a prototype? Why not just create the entire game, and if it doesn't work, we'd have all we need to try again? Prototypes exist exactly because we need to make the best use of the scarce time and resources we've got.</p><p class="calibre_2">When we build a prototype for a game, we're generally looking at:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Whether a mechanic is engaging</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Selecting the best idea from a set of alternatives</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Testing the technical feasibility of an idea (where the idea can be anything from a full game to a graphics technique or AI algorithm)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">If the user can navigate the game UI effectively and intuitively</li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">Please note that our first point is a huge one! To know what a fun mechanic is and how to judge whether yours is fun or not, you'd need to master everything we said in <a href="index_split_133.html#filepos359600"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 5</tt></a>, Adaptation of Mechanics, and <a href="index_split_150.html#filepos399514"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 6</tt></a>, Invention of Mechanics; make sure to go back to those chapters whenever you need more clarity!</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Prototyping techniques</p><p class="calibre_2">When it comes to creating a prototype, there are two main options: physical and digital.</p><p class="calibre_2">You would be surprised to know how many times a physical prototype is used in the video game industry. Many game mechanics can be reproduced through board games, card games, miniature games, or just one sheet of paper with a pen and maybe a few coloring pencils.</p><p class="calibre_2">Digital prototypes are a bit more complex to put together, but of course, their fidelity to the medium and ability to create real-time environments and handle complex calculations makes them the go-to choice. Most of the time, though, it is always a great idea to start very simply on paper, and then move to digital with clearer ideas.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Paper prototyping</p><p class="calibre_2">Paper prototypes are my favorites. Making them is as quick as it takes to write on a piece of paper and cut out some cardboard elements. Each time is like creating a little board game! Here's an example:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00006.jpg" class="calibre_38"/></p><p class="calibre_70">A simple sketch on a piece of paper might be a great start for a prototype; in this case, the emphasis is on the touch inputs for an RTS game</p><p class="calibre_2">If you're wondering what a paper prototype might look like, have a look at the following screenshot:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00068.jpg" class="calibre_39"/></p><p class="calibre_70">A paper prototype for an alternative combat system for Battlehand: Heroes. We're going to discuss this particular prototype as a case study later in this chapter</p><p class="calibre_2">I'm sure you imagined something much nicer and professional-looking. That's not the case at all!<br class="calibre1"/> Never trust a prototype that looks too good; as we said, by definition prototypes are stripped of anything not essential.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">It is important to note that there is a huge difference between a UX-UI paper prototype and a game paper prototype. Sometimes a game prototype might include UI and UX elements, but the questions we want to answer by paper prototyping a game are not related to usability or interface—we want to investigate the game mechanics and how fun they are. Always keep this in mind!</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Advantages of paper prototyping</p><p class="calibre_2">So let's have a look at the main advantages of paper prototyping:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Cheap: Paper prototypes are cheap, both in terms of time and resources.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">No programming involved: This is straightforward; everyone can create a paper prototype. You can apply your game design knowledge and be in full control of the game creation without involving any programmers or being limited by technology.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Easy and quick to create: You can create a paper prototype by sketching on a sheet of paper with a pencil. No creative process is quicker than this. Most of the prototypes require a bit more work though, such as cutting pieces of cardboard, printing some images or placeholders, and writing cards. Some paper prototypes can even use elements such as miniatures (from other games or easily purchasable online) or dice. No matter how much stuff you might need to create them, it will always be much quicker and easier than creating anything on a computer.<br class="calibre1"/></li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Easy to try and iterate: This is another incredible advantage. You can build a paper prototype in a couple of hours and try it with anyone (friends, family, colleagues) without having to build any working software. Anything that doesn't work can be changed immediately, even during the test itself. Iteration speed is the fastest it could be.<br class="calibre1"/></li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Abstraction: Abstraction is great when it comes to testing prototypes. There are no distractions coming from how the game looks or anything else that is not important. If those pieces of paper come to life and the rules generate fun dynamics, they could only get better by adding a theme and a visual aesthetic on top of them. Abstraction, as we are going to see in the next paragraph, is a double-edged sword as it also presents some risks.</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Limitations of paper prototypes</p><p class="calibre_2">Of course, like any tools, paper prototypes present some disadvantages:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Abstraction: To abstract on a system in a way that works on paper before the virtual world, the experience is required. You need to be able to distill the essential elements and leave out everything else. You'd need to make compromises and still create something that can answer real questions for the game as it is going to be on screen. Experience is the only way to master abstraction. The good news is that you can start prototype games right now, without studying any programming language, even away from your computer. You don't even have to invent a game, just pick an existing game and imagine how would you paper prototype some of its core mechanics. Don't be afraid of failure. Prototyping is all about making mistakes when they don't have dramatic repercussions. Prototype and fail as much as you can and with everything you can.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Struggle to represent complex and real-time scenarios: This is the main problem of paper prototypes. Just imagine what a paper prototype of a fighting game like Street Fighter would look like. Already giving you a headache, right? Even more difficult, imagine a paper prototype of a VR game, where the main mechanic is based on the navigation of a 3D space. Games that require the use of physical skill, complex calculations, physics, and many others present a huge challenge and sometimes they simply cannot be effectively abstracted into something that works on paper. So be aware that sometimes a paper prototype is simply not the right tool to answer your questions. That is fair enough, as fortunately, you have much more available!</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Can't fully replace digital prototypes: Another problem of paper prototypes is that they need to be translated into the digital world at some point. So they are indeed an extra step, as cheap as they are. The value of a paper prototype lies in the chance to catch big problems before any implementation; when your design seems to work on paper and the most evident problems have been discarded, move on to digital as soon as possible. Cheap and fast are the key-words for paper prototypes. As soon as a paper prototype shows signs of being slow and complex, you know this is the time to move on to digital or to realize you have to ask a more specific question and start from scratch again.</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Digital prototyping</p><p class="calibre_2">When your designs and paper prototypes come to life on screen is when things get serious. Be prepared to see what you have imagined in a very different way—be prepared to see things that don't work. The faster you realize something's wrong, the quicker you'll get back to the drawing board, and the better your chance of releasing a fun game. This is the idea behind digital prototypes. Put a working software together as soon as possible and iterate as much as you can on it to define and redefine your vision. Unlike paper prototyping, digital prototyping is a necessary step. If you're not prototyping, you are making a mistake. Period.</p><p class="calibre_2">It might happen that the prototyping phase is skipped, maybe because there's no time, no resources or the team is extremely confident to just move on to production right away. Remember, prototyping means seeking answers to specific questions. If you already have these answers, there's no need for a prototype. But if the answers are not clear, and the prototyping phase is skipped and the team moves onto development, what is really happening is that a very complex and high-fidelity prototype is being developed with the intention of selling it as a finished product.</p><p class="calibre_2">You can imagine how disastrous this approach would be if something doesn't work. You'd be surprised how often this happens, even in the most respected studios. And as a professional in the games industry, I guarantee you will hear a lot phrases such as "it's too late to change that", "it doesn't work, but we have to live with it" and so on and so forth. These phrases are the result of designs being implemented without questions, developed for months without early reviews and, in short, with no prototyping at all.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Common prototyping mistakes</p><p class="calibre_2">The only con of developing a digital prototype is that it will take some time, although it's guaranteed that it will save time in the long run. There are also some other pitfalls, though. Prototypes are tools, and as such, they could be used in the wrong way.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's have a look at the most common mistakes and pitfalls of prototyping.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">The never-ending prototype</p><p class="calibre_2">When working on a prototype, it is easy to get attached and try to make it right by iterating on the same thing over and over again. If something doesn't work, the design has to change. The sooner the team realizes it, the more the prototyping phase will serve its purpose. The risk of a quickly built prototype is that it might miss some important elements that might end up being essential for making a final judgment. As part of the iterative nature of prototypes, this is fine. A prototype can start very small (that is, just the core mechanic of a new game), and expand to something larger through successive iterations (that is, core mechanics and a few puzzles or enemies). However, the risk is to keep iterating outside of the scope of the initial question, such as by building a progression system on top of that core mechanic because it felt weak or incomplete. Whenever you feel that a prototype is increasing in scope and starts looking like an entire game, it is probably time to stop and re-assess whether those initial questions have been answered.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Spending time creating systems</p><p class="calibre_2">Diving into the game's final implementation with the hope of iterating later is always a bad idea. When building software, good engineering is required. The software has to be designed, just like the game. Systems need to be built before actual gameplay. Imagine a car racing game. The programmer needs to engineer a system that can handle different types of cars, with different values of speed, acceleration, braking, stability, and so on. He has to build this data system first, and only then will the designer be able to define the numbers and try them. When working on a prototype, the engineer should just hard-code the values the designer wants to try (maybe with a rudimentary system to expose those variables and make them changeable to the designer, so he can play with different values). The role of the programmer here is to get something playable on screen as soon as possible, by any means possible. System implementation should be always postponed to the implementation stage.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Using the prototype as a code-base for the production project</p><p class="calibre_2">A good, quick, on-the-point prototype is very likely to be a code mess, full of hacks and horrendous code writing, especially if it was written by the designer himself. You don't want to end up with that code in the final project. When a prototype works and all the questions have been answered, it's time to start from scratch. Now is the time to build those systems and allow an engineer to design the code properly. Again, the mirage of using the prototype code as a base to save time is just that: a mirage. Some time might be saved early on, but rest assured that the first time a problem arises all the time initially saved and more will be lost. This is true even if the prototype worked perfectly fine.</p><p class="calibre_2">That said, some experienced engineers might be able to create prototypes with perfectly engineered code ready to be taken into production. It is their call in the end and there are surely situations where this would be possible. However, when a designer or another less technical team member is involved in the creation, is always a better idea to let the engineer make this kind of decision.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Spending time adding features, art, and effects</p><p class="calibre_2">Any time spent adding stuff to a prototype that is not directly related to answering the initial questions is time lost. Not only that, every unnecessary thing added to a prototype is a step toward the prototype code evolving into the final game. Be wary of anything that seems to be working better after some good art, animations, or effects are added. You will be tempted to think that just by looking good a game could hide its design flaws.</p><p class="calibre_2">That is never true.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Seeking confirmations</p><p class="calibre_2">This is the most dangerous pitfall of prototyping.</p><p class="calibre_2">If you are convinced you already have an answer and you are building a prototype to demonstrate that it is right at all costs, you're missing a great opportunity. It is crucial to remain open-minded. It is very likely that you'd be building a prototype based on a hypothesis to make something new and better.</p><p class="calibre_2">Everyone would love to hear how brilliant the solution provided by their prototypes is, and it's great when it happens. If it doesn't, the biggest mistake you can make is to be protective of your work and fail to see how a negative response is as useful as a good one. A prototype that shows how something does not work is a success as much as one that has been proven right.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember: the goal is to have answers, not to actually build the game.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">A step-by-step guide to prototyping</p><p class="calibre_2">Here follows a step-by-step process for developing an effective prototype. These steps can be used to prototype an entire game or just a single feature, or maybe just to evaluate a change to an existing system.</p><p class="calibre_2">Step 1: Ask the right questions</p><p class="calibre_2">Whether the prototype is for trying out a game idea or a new mechanic or to evaluate and improve something within your game, you need to have a clear problem in mind and how you imagine the prototype is going to solve it. Never start prototyping if you don’t know what you need to evaluate or prove.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">What would make a good question? And a bad one?<br class="calibre1"/> Usually, good questions are specific. Asking whether a mechanic is fun or not would be a bad question. What do we mean by fun? A better question would probably be: does this mechanic provide enough decision-making for the player? Are his choices meaningful?</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Step 2: Select the framework and tools</p><p class="calibre_2">Paper or digital prototyping? If paper, is it going to need anything other than just pen and paper? Maybe dice, miniatures, cards? If digital, does it require a game engine? A spreadsheet? A presentation?</p><p class="calibre_2">Some of these things might not be very clear at the beginning. In that case, start with something and evaluate what else you might need as you go. If you realize something does work—say you find out you're not able to prototype a system on paper—just scrap it and start over with a better tool.</p><p class="calibre_2">Step 3: Create the rules</p><p class="calibre_2">This is extremely important for paper prototypes: what are the rules? How do you actually play the prototype? Paper prototype rules look a lot like a board game rule manual. Make sure the rules are simple and clear. Also, digital prototypes need rules. What kind of mechanic do you need to implement? How will you be able to condense a complex game into its abstract and essential version?</p><p class="calibre_2">Step 4: Implement and create the prototype</p><p class="calibre_2">It doesn't matter if this is writing the code or cutting out the elements with a pair of scissors. Make something playable happen as soon as possible</p><p class="calibre_2">Step 5: First Playtest</p><p class="calibre_2">As soon as you've got something playable, try it. Nothing is going to work as you imagined. The first play of a prototype is crucial because if you approach it with bias, thinking that it is going to work, you are committing one of the common mistakes. The first iteration of any prototype is not going to work. So when you play the first time, take notes and go back to the drawing board to make the changes you need. When we say play, we mean to play it with as many people as you can—especially people not involved in the development. At this stage what you really need is an unbiased opinion.</p><p class="calibre_2">Step 6: Iterate</p><p class="calibre_2">Re-implement anything that wasn't right the last time, play with your variables, change the rules. Do this until you find an answer to your initial question.</p><p class="calibre_2">Play and iterate should be quick processes. If you don't find your answers after a few iterations, it might well be that you're asking the wrong question or that you don't want to admit that the answers are just disproving your concept.</p><p class="calibre_2">If your hypothesis is disproved by your prototype, don't try to pursue that solution anyway.</p><p class="calibre_2">Prototyping is a process worth doing only if you’re willing to accept the consequences and dump what doesn't work.</p><p class="calibre_2">Step 7: Move on</p><p class="calibre_2">There are only two possible outcomes from the previous steps: you either prove or disprove your hypothesis. In both cases, the job of your prototype is over. If the answer is not the one you hoped for, don't make the mistake of forcing things to work out your way. If the answer is positive, don't try to add on top of your prototype and make it the feature or the game. Move on and build something new from the answers you have got, not from the prototype you have created.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Prototyping exercise</p><p class="calibre_2">So, you know the differences between paper and digital prototyping. You can start working and getting the experience right now with paper.</p><p class="calibre_2">In fact, you must start right now.</p><p class="calibre_2">Before reading on, grab a pen and a piece of paper and try to prototype something. It has to be something doable in under an hour, don't worry about trying something really cool or a real game idea you have. Try to get really practical.</p><p class="calibre_2">Here are some ideas:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">A racing game for two players A and B, such as Game of the Goose</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">A simple combat system for a 1v1 card game</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">A puzzle level for a platformer game such as Super Meat Boy</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">A 1v1 strategy game that uses a board and a grid, like Chess</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Don’t worry about the results, just try it and see what you come up with in under one hour.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">The hands-on game designer</p><p class="calibre_2">If you tried to create some paper prototypes, you might have found answers to your questions. If you did right, you might also have even more questions.</p><p class="calibre_2">One question could be: does it really work like this? Absolutely yes.</p><p class="calibre_2">Prototyping is about discovering, trying, and making mistakes. If you don't try, you will never learn. The next step would be trying to create something in the digital world. Here things become tougher because you might not have any programming skills and probably not even know where to start. Mark these words: by learning how to use a game engine and program basic game mechanics and small prototypes, you will be ahead of any aspiring game designers who don't have this skill.</p><p class="calibre_2">This is the real skill that will always give you an edge over the thousands of other designers that will be competing with you for the few design roles available in the game industry. Reading and studying is the bare minimum, so don't think that by reading this and many other game design books you will be any better than your competition. All of them have done the same!</p><p class="calibre_2">The other factor that makes you a better (more desirable, to be precise) designer is your experience. If you have never worked on a game professionally, it is unlikely that you’ll be ever considered better than a designer who did. When you have little or no professional experience there's only one thing that will make you stand out: your personal projects and the ability to design and implement your ideas. I call this game designer The hands-on game designer. It is a rare breed, and as such it is in high demand anywhere in the game industry.</p><p class="calibre_2">Learn how to implement and code your games. You don't need to learn how to go beyond the prototyping stage. You don't have to master computer science or software engineering principles. You just need to know how to make your design happen on screen in a prototype. Do so and you’ll have one foot already in your first job as a game designer.</p><p class="calibre_2">Not only that, as your experience increases in game design, you will find your technical skills to be an incredible tool for communicating ideas, pitching projects, demonstrating your hypotheses, and most of all, for working independently or freeing up the engineers from some implementation work, leaving them more time to focus on more important tasks. You yourself will have more control over how your designs make it into the game. Be a hands-on designer. Be practical and evaluate your work in terms of how many things you can make happen.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">A paper prototype case-study</p><p class="calibre_2">We are going to examine in detail a case study from my personal work experience at Another Place Productions. At a certain point during the development of our latest game, Battlehand Heroes, we had to address an unexpected problem. The combat system that was good enough for the first title of the Battlehand IP was proving problematic in the new game.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Questioning a combat system</p><p class="calibre_2">Battlehand: Heroes is a turn-based RPG in which the player builds his team of heroes, each with a unique deck of cards to battle. The combat system that worked quite well in the first game, Battlehand, was lacking the depth to engage a new generation of players. The first game was released in 2015, and player's tastes and expectations for games always evolve, so games need to also. The players struggled to understand why they should play one card instead of another, how to choose their strategy, and how to correctly react to the enemy's moves.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">You might wonder how we actually found out these problems in the game: by playtesting! It is crucial to test your game as soon as possible with real players and note down everything about their experience. We're going to talk more about playtesting and user research later in this book.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">We discussed many different solutions for improving the core of the combat systems, but before committing the development team to any of those, we decided to prototype on paper the more promising ideas.</p><p class="calibre_2">The combat system is based on 2v2 heroes battles, the player can manage each of his heroes and their own deck of 8 cards. Each hero belongs to an element: Earth, Fire, Water, Air, or Spirit. They are governed by a rock-paper-scissors (RPS) strength/weakness relation:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00104.jpg" class="calibre_40"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Battlehand elemental RPS mechanic: Fire is strong against Earth, Earth is strong against Air, Air against Spirit, Spirit against Water and Water against Fire</p><p class="calibre_2">My hypothesis was that the game could have benefited from the introduction of a multi-layered RPS system on top of the elements. Up to this point, each hero could have cards that could be heal, shield, and attack. All of them balanced around their mere power (the more the damage, the shield points, or the HP cured, the better the card, basically). The idea was to try to assign to each card a property that could make it strong or weak against other cards regardless of their numbers. If a shield could block most of the attacks but some attacks can automatically pierce a shield, that would create an interesting scenario where the right card for the right situation may not always be the most powerful one, and it would be up to the player to select it.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Addressing the problem</p><p class="calibre_2">This is an advanced, real-life scenario; as such, things are never exactly as predicted. In fact, the prototype needed to answer more than one question. But let's get back to the problems again.</p><p class="calibre_2">The combat lacks depth in the sense that:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">One of the most important strategic choices in the fight is about which hero you select for that specific combat (to be strong against the enemy elements). The strategy should also propagate into the combat itself, not just exist in the pre-fight.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">When it is time to play a card, the best one to play is always the most powerful. The choice could be more interesting.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">All the heroes have access to all the card types (shields, heals, attacks), so each hero can fulfill all the roles in combat (healer, supporter, attacker, defender, and so on).</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">With these problems clearly in mind, we can ask the right questions.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Asking the right questions – step 1</p><p class="calibre_2">Does the prototyped system:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Create a scenario where I don't always choose the most powerful card, but the most useful for that specific situation?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Allow me to think and plan a few card draws ahead?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Shift the attention from the RPS mechanic to the cards?</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Selecting the tools – step 2</p><p class="calibre_2">With a clear problem and clear questions to answer, it is time to identify which kind of prototype are we going to need. A great thing about old school turn-based RPG and card games is that using paper prototypes comes just naturally to them! If you consider the few other solutions to evaluate and prototype, paper prototyping sounds like the quickest and cheapest solution.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Creating the rules – step 3</p><p class="calibre_2">A paper prototype is always an abstraction of what you get in a digital game, so it's more important than ever to get in only the essential stuff.</p><p class="calibre_2">These are the rules I came up with:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00040.jpg" class="calibre_41"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Don't worry if these rules are not very clear to you, the point of this exercise is to understand the prototyping process more than the specific example!</p><p class="calibre_2">For your reference, this is a screenshot of a few Battlehand Heroes cards at the time of the prototype creation:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00132.jpg" class="calibre_42"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Four cards from an early version of Battlehand: Heroes</p><p class="calibre_2">As you can see, there is a huge difference between the real game mechanics and the prototype's rules, but the core is really the same. The questions we asked can be answered by a much simpler abstraction of the digital game.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Implementation – step 4</p><p class="calibre_2">This is the part I love the most. To create the prototype, I simply cut 8 cards per hero and wrote the card rules on each of them. Then I created the various tokens needed and used 4 miniatures to represent the heroes.</p><p class="calibre_2">I also used dice to keep track of the various numbers going on in the game and colored cardboard on which I took various notes related to the heroes during the gameplay.</p><p class="calibre_2">Each hero's deck was designed to create a compelling experience with just a few cards. We will learn later about balancing and how to set up every number and variable in a game:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00199.jpg" class="calibre_43"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Our Water hero, with his 8 cards and all the necessary pieces to play the prototype</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">First play – step 5</p><p class="calibre_2">The first play showed a very promising experience. Playing the prototype was fun and it was clear that the whole thing was on the right track. Of course, the initial questions were really spot-on, as the knowledge of the game we had was deep and based on a previous title for the same IP and a long list of well-known problems and possible improvements.</p><p class="calibre_2">What really required some more thought were the rules. The damage and HP ranges were too tight: with attacks dealing 1 to 4 damage and heroes having from 6 to 12 HP, some cards were too strong and some heroes were too weak.</p><p class="calibre_2">Another flaw was the lack of a combination of card plays (COMBO) to get greater advantages (that is, two consecutive DOT attacks dealing extra damage).</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Iteration – step 6</p><p class="calibre_2">With the problems of the first play in mind, the iterative process of improving the prototype started: we tweaked the numbers, added a combo system, and switched some of the cards (for example, we removed all the healing cards from a hero that was supposed to be more focused on attacking).</p><p class="calibre_2">By continuing to play the prototype, two other flaws emerged. Some battles were dragging on for too long in a sort of stall, so we added a damage crescendo after a certain number of turns passed. We also found that the combo was hard to line up and a bit unsatisfactory, so we decided on an extreme solution: lining up a combo means instant-killing the target hero. This little change spiced up the entire combat a lot, giving a great reward to long-term planning. Of course in the real game nothing that powerful would be implemented, but the game was clearly more fun and engaging. So we noted that down and kept it in mind for our final version of the combo system.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Final step</p><p class="calibre_2">Were all the questions answered?</p><p class="calibre_2">I’d say yes, perfectly:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Having different types of cards be more or less powerful against different types of shields moved the attention away from just the mere numbers, so I found myself going for a less powerful card that had the proper effect to rightly counter the enemy setup. This was happening consistently enough to make me think about new interesting types of cards and abilities and how to build a more effective deck.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">The extreme combo system forced me to always think how to pull out a good combo and added a lot of thrill to the next card draw.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">The elemental advantage became almost irrelevant, with the whole focus of the combat shifted onto the battle itself. It even cast some doubts about the elemental wheel, as it made it clear that the RPS mechanic was previously too much on the meta-game side (limiting the strategic choices to the pre-battle phase, when deciding which elements to bring into battle).</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">With these great answers, we were able to move to digital. As we mentioned, the downside of paper prototypes is that if they work on paper, you have to try them in the digital world too before starting the actual production. There are rare cases where the answer is so clear that you can move to production really quickly, but what you want to do with paper prototypes is to fail fast more than really find a working solution. If it doesn't work on paper, it most likely won't anywhere. On the other hand, if it does work on paper, you still have to make sure you can translate that abstraction into something that works in a video game.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">From paper to digital</p><p class="calibre_2">In our specific case, bringing the prototype to the digital game was a fairly easy and quick job.</p><p class="calibre_2">As the game was already developed to a playable stage, the main job was to modify the current game system to reflect the new changes. Of course, we had to adapt the rules from the paper prototype to the digital game logic, implement them in the quickest and efficient way, play, and iterate:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00063.jpg" class="calibre_44"/></p><p class="calibre_70">The cards from the paper prototype were implemented in the digital game</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Abstraction versus reality</p><p class="calibre_2">After we implemented the prototype principles in the actual game, we were ready to start over with the iterations.</p><p class="calibre_2">In fact, what has been proved on paper was just a quick way to commit to a more serious prototype. It wasn't a definitive answer that the system would have worked. Think about paper prototyping as a green light for the actual digital prototyping.</p><p class="calibre_2">The digital prototype was replicating quite well the experience that we had on paper, but some improvements became obvious and necessary only at this stage:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">The focus on the numbers became too prominent again. Instead of enjoying the immediate action of dragging a card on the enemies and seeing its effect, a lot of calculations were required to understand which card was the best choice.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">The number of cards (8 per hero's deck and 4 in each hand at any given time) was still overwhelming; with so many choices it felt like none were really meaningful (and some were too obviously wrong).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">We needed to introduce the entire library of card effects. Not only Damage Over Time, Piercing shield, and the few others we had in the prototype—the list of Battlehand: Heroes card's effects included many others, such as Speed Up, various immunities, Stun, Freeze, and dozens more. The complexity of rumped add a lot, and with those effects at the center of the RPS mechanic, the cognitive overload was a problem.</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Moving on</p><p class="calibre_2">After assessing the reality of the digital prototype, we iterated, again and again, removing everything that wasn't quite working in the more realistic digital scenario. This process took around two weeks and when we felt we had all our answers, we went back to our game in the production environment, leaving the prototype behind. The following is a screenshot of how the battle screen looked prior to our updating:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00134.jpg" class="calibre_45"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Battlehand: Heroes before the combat system update. Note the Initiative bar on the right, the number of cards in the hand, and the card layout</p><p class="calibre_2">We made all the changes necessary to bring across all the good things that truly worked in our prototype, and we were confident in doing so. In the following screenshot, you can see what the game looked like after this process:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00035.jpg" class="calibre_46"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Battlehand: Heroes after the combat system update, there are only three cards in each hero's hand and their layout is much more essential</p><p class="calibre_2">The preceding screenshots can't convey how the gameplay has changed from one version to other, but you can see how everything that we have changed in the layout of the battle screen and the cards reflects our findings from the prototyping:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">The number of cards in each hero's hand has been decreased to three (and those in the decks to six).</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">The numbers have been removed from the cards—both the turn counters (top-left corner) and the value of damage/healing/shield from the center of the card.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">The target icon has been made clearer.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Each card has a clear effect, which can be seen on the round icon in the bottom left corner of the card. The first one, Smoking Girder, has the ability to destroy the target's shield in one hit. The second, Oil Drum, can weaken the enemy, increasing the damage he takes, and the last one, Kapow, always hits regardless of the target evading or any other modifier on the hero's accuracy.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">The initiative bar has been removed and replaced with a turn bar (yellow bar with the five notches) above the HP bar of each character (the green bar underneath each character).</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">All of these changes reflect the need to change and tweak parts of the game that were simply not possible to evaluate without a prototype. They are the result of an iterative process that, through subsequent changes and evaluation, allowed us to sculpt a final product from a rough initial model.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">The screenshots used in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only.

We described in detail paper prototyping and how you can start doing it right now, without any particular technical knowledge. This chapter heavily emphasized paper prototyping over its digital counterpart, because it is really at the core of what you can do to create a game and become a better game designer without having to learn anything else. The reader who, at this point of the book, will try to create his own paper prototype and start experimenting with some board game design is the one who already stepped out from being a learner to being a maker.</p><p class="calibre_2">We moved onto digital prototyping, and how even pretty basic technical skills could make all the difference for a rookie game designer and give them a great competitive edge to break into the game industry and be able to give life to their own vision. We can't recommend enough that you practice with what you have learned so far. Regardless of the platform of your choice, design and create something, right now!</p><p class="calibre_2">Now that you have understood how to create the atoms of a game and implement them into prototypes, we're ready to learn how to tie them up into a consistent experience that has a beginning and (most of the time) an end. In the next chapter, we're going to talk about the use of Narrative and how to pace the progression of the player throughout the game experience.</p><div></body></html>
