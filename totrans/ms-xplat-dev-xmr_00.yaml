- en: Although it was initially born as a community effort to port the .NET libraries
    and common language runtime compilers to various operating systems, the Xamarin
    product suite soon became the common ground to develop applications for Android
    and iOS operating systems using the .NET framework and the most popular CLR language,
    C#. The emergence of the Xamarin development platform created a new development
    niche, serving products to a variety of platforms at the same time while letting
    users adapt their existing .NET development skills to these new platforms and
    produce applications for a wider range of devices and operating systems. Thanks
    to Xamarin, developers are now enjoying a new era where development efforts don't
    target only a single application platform, but span multiple devices including
    smart phones, tablets, personal computers, and even wearable devices, creating
    highly efficient native applications.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to build the sample project and make use of the code samples in this
    book, you will need a Xamarin.iOS and/or Xamarin.Android subscription, depending
    on the platform you want to target. Most of the diagnostic tools used are distributed
    as part of the development SDKs for the target platforms. As a development IDE,
    you will need Visual Studio 2013 (or higher) or Xamarin Studio if you are using
    or configuring a Windows based development environment, but only Xamarin Studio
    otherwise. For testing and diagnostics, real mobile devices or SDK-provided emulators
    can be used.
