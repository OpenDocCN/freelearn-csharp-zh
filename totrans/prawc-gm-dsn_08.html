<div id="filepos532760" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Games and Stories</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We have been discussing how to create a vision and communicate it to the team, and how to design game mechanics and prototype them to answer fundamental questions as soon as possible in the development process. We have learned how to distill what we call <span class="italic">fun</span> into an interactive experience. It is now time to look at how to take all these elements and make them part of a narrative that can take our players into a virtual world and awaken their imagination, immersing them in the kind of experience that only video games can offer.</p><p class="calibre_2">Video games (just like books, movies, or plays) can tell stories. Stories are one of the most powerful things human beings can use to communicate. The power of the video game medium, though, lies in one extra thing other mediums rarely have: the enormous potential of interactivity. There's more: this potential is far from being fully known, understood, and accepted at large.</p><p class="calibre_2">Consider that literature and written stories have been around for millennia (one of the first written stories we know is the Epic of Gilgamesh, dating back from Ancient Mesopotamia, 2100 BC). Theatre was born in Ancient Greece around 600 BC. Even if we think about printed books (a much more recent invention), we are talking about centuries ago (Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1440). Fast forward in time to the first decades of the last century, where motion pictures arose and films, as we know them today, were born. Television and cinema are things even our great-grandfathers were accustomed to.</p><p class="calibre_2">Video games, on the other hand, are something that wasn't available to the masses before 1970, and even back then, they weren't used as a form of storytelling. Complex stories, deep characters, profound themes began to appear later, in the late 80's, and flourished in the 90's. That is less than 40 years ago, just think about it! Many people still think that video games are just entertainment for kids and teenagers. Some players don't even consider themselves gamers, especially casual gamers that spend hours playing games such as <span class="italic">Candy Crush Saga</span> or <span class="italic">Double Down Casino Slots</span>. The generations born before the seventies didn't grow up with video games. But my generation, which is the generation of today's young adults born between the end of the seventies and the mid-eighties, was fully immersed in them. We witnessed the rise of game consoles and the birth of pretty much every video game franchise. Games are part of our life and culture.</p><p class="calibre_2">It is safe to say that, a few decades into the future, pretty much everyone will be familiar with video games as a modern form of storytelling.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_443"/>


<div id="filepos535783" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Narrative</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The Oxford dictionary defines Narrative as follows:</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">"A spoken or written account of connected events; a story"</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">See what I meant earlier in this chapter's introduction? It's already outdated! Narrative doesn't have to be necessarily spoken or written...it can be told through images, both still (photography, art) or moving (motion pictures and yes, video games!). There is one common mistake though: the belief that interactivity might change the basic rules of storytelling that have been set through millennia of human history. It doesn't.</p><p class="calibre_2">The story is the goal, regardless of how it is told. So the rules of a good story never change.</p><p class="calibre_2">In fact, in this chapter, we will just briefly discuss how a good story is written. It is a huge topic that would need a few books in itself. As usual, I can never recommend enough that you pick up this topic and to study it in depth, if that's what interests you the most. Not all designers are story writers. If you'd like to specialize in this particular field...read, play, watch, and study! You can start by reading some books on screenwriting, creative writing, or a specific book about video game writing.</p><p class="calibre_2">As a game designer, what's really important is to know how to take the pieces of the narrative and recount them in a way that works with your game. Ultimately, a game designer's job is to make a story playable.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_445"/>


<div id="filepos537575" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Do all games have a narrative?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">An everlasting question. And there is no definitive answer. But is worth mentioning that some games are pretty abstract. <span class="italic">Tetris</span> comes immediately to mind, but any puzzle game or brain game is very unlikely to tell any kind of story. In a game such as <span class="italic">Threes,</span> the player only needs to slide numbered tiles on a four-by-four grid to combine addends and multiples of three. Of course, comparing those games to narrative rich games (or even to games with an extremely simple narrative, like the aforementioned <span class="italic">Space Invaders)</span> might give the impression that they don't have any narrative.</p><p class="calibre_2">But isn't the player playing those games creating a story in itself?<br class="calibre1"/> Can the player get such an amazing score in <span class="italic">Tetris</span> or <span class="italic">Threes</span> that he will tell the story to all her friends over and over again? "Ah! Have I ever told you about the time I got 999,999 points in Tetris?"</p><p class="calibre_2">This is exactly a story, a story where the player is the protagonist!</p><p class="calibre_2">No matter what the final answer to this question is, there is one truth that every designer should keep in mind:<br class="calibre1"/> A good game <span class="bold">generates</span>
<span class="bold">stories</span> when people play it. It is what Jesse Schell calls the <span class="italic">Story Machine</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">The <span class="italic">Story Machine</span> concept has been applied in many games. It involves giving the player a toolbox of elements he or she can interact with to create what we defined as <span class="italic">emergent gameplay</span> in <a href="index_split_150.html#filepos399514"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 6</tt></span></a><span class="italic">, Invention of Mechanics.</span> Games such as <span class="italic">The Sims</span> or <span class="italic">Far Cry</span> are brilliant examples of this concept. In <span class="italic">Far Cry 4,</span> the player can decide how to tackle the various challenge in different ways, including exploiting the environments by luring a predatory animal into an enemy camp instead of fighting, or burning down a tree and letting the fire spread in a certain area.</p><p class="calibre_2">Make sure the game you are designing enables players to create different stories by making different choices.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_447"/>


<div id="filepos539997" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Why are stories good for games?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">"Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie: it's expected to be there, but it's not that important."</p><p class="calibre_2">This quote from John Carmack, the creator of <span class="italic">Doom</span> and founder of <span class="italic">ID software</span>, should give you an idea of the size of the debate around games and stories. On one hand, what Carmack said is understandable, as he wanted to emphasize the fact that games are what they are because they must be played first and foremost. On the other hand, game stories can evoke emotions as deep as those we feel by watching movies or reading books. It is a matter of opinions, but one thing is objective: stories and games work very well together. It's the reason why so many games feature some kind of story and some of the most successful and critically acclaimed games of the last decade involve meaningful and rich stories and great characters.</p><p class="calibre_2">Why is that? Why are stories so good for games? There are multiple answers.</p><p class="calibre_2">First of all, stories create an emotional attachment with the <span class="italic">listener</span> (which is the player, in our case). This is already huge. Also, stories provide a structure (usually with a beginning, a middle, and an end) through which gameplay moments can be organized. It provides a motivation to play that transcends the gameplay. Players will naturally want to know more about the plot, the characters, and the game world.</p><p class="calibre_2">Lastly, as Raph Koster explains in his book <span class="italic">A theory of fun,</span> games are naturally played by humans to learn (and not only by humans; animals learn through play too!). Stories serve the same purpose. Games and stories are connected at a very deep level. Structuring one around the other will help you shape your design and, probably, make better games.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_449"/>


<div id="filepos542097" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Traditional narrative models</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We can identify two main models to structure a video game narrative, the three-act story and the Monomyth (or hero's journey). Of course, these are not the only existing two, but they are the most used and the ones from which other structure have developed. The monomyth, as we're going to see, is a more specific and elaborate version of the three-act story that doesn't only cover the story structure but also the characters that live in it.</p><p class="calibre_2">These two models are a great starting point for understanding the deep relationship between narrative and games. Don't be scared by the fact that most stories share the same core structure. It's been this way for hundreds of years, and nonetheless so many different stories have been told. For sure, there are other ways to tell a story, there's so much more still to discover and invent. But our advice is always to master the fundamental rules before attempting to change or disrupt them!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_451"/>


<div id="filepos543289" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Three-act story</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The concept behind the three-act story is very simple: each story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. This concept is extremely intuitive, as most of the stories we know follow it. Just think about the classic fairy tales that start with <span class="italic">Once upon a time</span> and end with <span class="italic">and they lived happily ever after</span>, after a series of events. Movies, books, and many games follow the same pattern.</p><p class="calibre_2">A better definition of beginning, middle, and end are given by looking at what happens in each of these parts, or <span class="italic">acts:</span></p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Introduction</span>
<span class="bold">(beginning)</span>: This is where the story is set up. The characters are described and the setting is presented. Everything in this section answers questions such as <span class="italic">who</span> and <span class="italic">why.</span> Who are the protagonists of the story and why are they involved in the events that are about to unfold? What are their motivations? Usually, the introduction ends with an event that prompts the protagonist to solve some sort of conflict. A solid introduction allows readers/viewers/players to identify with the protagonist and understand his or her motivations to act.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Confrontation (middle)</span>: This is the biggest part of a story; many events can happen in this act. The basic idea is that the protagonist confronts the conflict and the source of this conflict (traditionally the villain) is presented. The tension increases dramatically throughout this arc and culminates in the moment when the protagonist is about to resolve the conflict.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Resolution (end):</span> The grand finale. The conflict is resolved (either in a happy or bad ending). Once the conflict is resolved the story is quickly wrapped up (as the emotional escalation has peaked and is now fading).</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_453"/>


<div id="filepos545422" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Monomyths</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">In narratology, the monomyth is a template for stories with a protagonist (the Hero) who goes on an adventure, faces some sort of crisis or conflict, and triumphs over it. By the time he goes back home, he has been transformed by his journey. The study of the monomyth dates back to ancient Greece and monomyths have been at the center of the human experience for millennia.</p><p class="calibre_2">In 1949 Joseph Campbell popularized the Monomyth in his landmark book: "The Hero with a Thousand Faces."</p><p class="calibre_2">Campbell described the structure of a narrative as follows:</p><p class="calibre_2">"A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man."</p><p class="calibre_2">Campbell identified 17 stages of the hero's journey. Not every story contains all 17 stages; some may focus on only a few of the stages, while others may include them in a different order:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00076.jpg" class="calibre_47"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">The hero's journey. Source: </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Wikipedia (</span></span><span class="calibre4">anonymous</span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">)</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The hero's journey is now widely used by many creative professionals working not only in games but in movies, TV, novels, and comic books. It is not the only narrative pattern, but it is one of those that works extremely well for video game stories, as they so often involve the presence of a hero and entail them going on some sort of adventure.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_455"/>

<div id="filepos548056" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Departure</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">In this act, the hero or protagonist's ordinary world is introduced and the normal routine is shaken when the hero receives a call to go on an adventure. The hero usually refuses the call, but a mentor figure steps in to encourage and advise him:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">The call to adventure</span>: The hero is depicted in his ordinary world, leading an ordinary life. Suddenly, some information is received that calls the hero to a journey into the unknown.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Refusal of the call</span>: The hero refuses to give up his ordinary life. It might be because of fear, duty, insecurity...any excuse that holds the hero to his current ordinary world.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Supernatural aid</span>: Once the hero commits to his new mission (consciously or subconsciously), a mentor appears and offers his help. It might come in many forms: advice, training, or aid, often magical, like the gift of an artifact that will help the hero in his quest.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Crossing the first threshold</span>: The hero finally leaves the ordinary world and enters the unknown adventure world.</li></ol><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_459"/>


<div id="filepos549483" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Initiation</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The initiation act begins with the hero stepping into the unknown, where he faces trials, either alone or with the assistance of helpers. The hero proceeds into his adventure until a crisis of some sort puts him to the test. He must undergo <span class="italic">the ordeal</span> and eventually overcomes the main obstacle or enemy. This is the <span class="italic">apotheosis</span> where finally the mission is accomplished and the hero can get his reward.</p><p class="calibre_2">But the journey's not over. The hero must return to the ordinary world now. He may be pursued by the guardians from the new world, or he may be reluctant to return at all:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">The road of trials</span>: The hero undertakes a series of tests and begins his transformation. Usually the hero experiences failure.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">The meeting with the goddess</span>: The hero gains the help he needs. The goddess here signifies love and its ultimate power against adversity.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Woman as temptress</span>: In this step, the hero faces those temptations that may lead him or her to abandon or stray for the mission. The woman is a metaphor for the physical or material temptations of life, but of course, it doesn't have to be a woman (keep in mind Campbell wrote all this in 1949!).</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Ordeal</span>: The hero atones from whatever represents the ultimate power holder in his life: might be a person, a culture, a belief, or a fear. The hero's inner monsters represent a life or death crisis. All the previous steps have been moving into this place, all that follow will move out from it.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Apotheosis</span>: The hero reaches a point of a greater understanding. He is now ready to truly face the more difficult part of his journey.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">The ultimate boon</span>: Armed with all he has learned so far, the hero faces his/her ultimate challenge and wins.</li></ol><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_461"/>

The hero is transformed by the adventure and gains wisdom or spiritual power over both the new and original worlds. He will never be the same:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Refusal of the return</span>: The idea of returning to the ordinary world unsettles the hero. Having experienced all the wonders and bliss of the world out there, he faces the challenge of bringing back the enlightenment he has achieved.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">The magic flight</span>: The return journey might still be filled with perils, which the hero can confront with his new self.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Rescue from without</span>: In the same way the hero needed help during his quest, he might need guides and assistants to go back to where he belongs. Heroes sometimes need someone to bring them back to everyday life, especially if they have been wounded or weakened by the experience.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">The crossing of the return threshold</span>: The hero needs to retain the wisdom he has gained on his quest, to integrate that wisdom into a ordinary life, and then maybe figure out how to share the wisdom with the rest of the world.</li></ol><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="5" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Master of two worlds</span>: The hero lives comfortably both in the inner and outer world, material and spiritual, transcending his ego.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Freedom to live</span>: Knowledge frees the hero from the fear of death, which in turn is the freedom to live.

<div id="filepos554971" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Designing narrative for video games</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We have briefly seen the structure of a story, but how is narrative designed for a video game? And how is it implemented?</p><p class="calibre_2">The first thing to note is that a game cannot be simply written and then played out by the system like it was a movie. A game narrative unfolds when someone actually plays the game, so mechanics and dynamics are as important as the story, if not even more so. Interactive storytelling means that players should play and experience the story through their actions. Reading or listening notes and watching cutscenes should give an idea of a deeper immersion in the game world, but should never come before the actual gameplay. The idea is that, even in the most narrative-driven game, the player should be able to bolt through the game skipping any reading, listening, or cutscene...and still be able to make sense of the game story, simply by playing it.</p><p class="calibre_2">Not an easy task for us designers!</p><p class="calibre_2">We have already seen in <a href="index_split_070.html#filepos210445"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 3</tt></span></a><span class="italic">, Scoping a Game Project</span>, how games are structured. They can be linear, non-linear, open, or endless. Narrative design shares a lot with game structure. The reason is very simple; a game with a narrative is most likely <span class="bold">structured around that narrative.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_465"/>


<div id="filepos556591" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Linear narrative</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">It is safe to say that a linear narrative is the simplest form of interactive narrative. A series of key events develops the story and the player advances from one to the other with gameplay actions. The interactivity is actually pretty limited. Have a look at the following image: the arrows are the story, presented in the form of cutscenes, animated sequences, images, or just plain text. The circles represent the player's actions. This visual representation is usually called the <span class="bold">Strings of Pearls</span> or <span class="bold">Rivers and Lakes:</span></p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00137.jpg" class="calibre_48"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">The String of Pearls storytelling method.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">It is important to note how the story in a linear narrative is actually non-interactive. Whatever the outcome of the player's actions, the story will remain on track and unfold as the player progresses. The only control the player has over the story is to not actually make any progress.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Don't make the easy mistake of thinking that linear narrative is bad in video games. Not all video games need intricate storylines with multiple endings and branches. A video game can still be amazing and tell great stories using a linear narrative!</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> Just think about FPS games such as Doom or Call of Duty, or games with rich storylines such as The Last of Us or Tomb Raider.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">A linear narrative shifts all the weight onto two factors:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">How good is the story?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">How good is the gameplay?</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">We already talked about this and how delicate the crafting of linear games is.

<div id="filepos558863" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Linear with extended space of action</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Some games might still follow a linear narrative, but the player explore the surroundings. In terms of narrative though, the linearity is still given by the fact that this freedom of exploration doesn't impact the storyline. The story doesn't move forward by exploring; some more story details might be acquired by the player, but there is no overall impact on the story.</p><p class="calibre_2">A great example of exploration that enhances the storyline without affecting its course are books, documents, or audio files with bits of information scattered around levels. They reward players who explore the game maps, but they don't change anything story-wise. This practice is widely used, especially in FPS games with a linear storyline.</p><p class="calibre_2">Imagine a game where the finding of a secret document in a suitcase actually opens up a different storyline, where the character finds out that a goal he was pursuing was actually a hoax and he's now able to pursue the right direction. A game with such possibility is leaving the space of linearity and is moving into a modular narrative. The part of the story where the character is tricked into following the wrong path is removed only if the player doesn't find the secret document.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_469"/>


<div id="filepos560374" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Modular narrative</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">There are many ways to define a complex narrative; the term I like the most is <span class="italic">modular narrative</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">When a narrative becomes more complex, the design effort should focus on integrating the narrative into the gameplay harmoniously, allowing the player to experience each part of the narrative like it was written to be an actual part of the same story.</p><p class="calibre_2">To build a modular narrative the story must be crafted in a way that can be cut into different forms, each representing different outcomes according to the player's actions. An important NPC might die (or not) at some point in the game, with a dramatic impact on the rest of the game. Building story modules means designing the story to go on in both cases: either with the NPC alive or dead.</p><p class="calibre_2">The real challenge that video games can pose to writers is writing articulate storylines for non-linear games, especially open-world games.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Witcher III</span> is a fantastic example of non-linear storytelling with hundreds of different stories going on at the same time. The player is free to jump in and out of those stories, some of them might even progress regardless of the player paying attention to them. Within all this, there is still an overarching storyline that follows the player's journey from beginning to end.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's have a look at different types of modular narrative.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_471"/>


<div id="filepos562130" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Graph</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A graph structure implies that choices create a branching narrative. The branches could lead to completely different paths and endings (in which case the graph is actually called a Tree) or can rejoin it at certain points and then branch again:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00070.jpg" class="calibre_49"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">In a graph structure, each node represents a story point where the player can make a choice and proceed to the next node</span></p><p class="calibre_2">There could even be multiple graphs, connected only at some specific points. We talk in this case about <span class="italic">Parallel plot structure</span>, in which two plots or points of view are told at the same time and the point of view switches between the different parallel versions. Once the point of view is switched, the narration could take either a linear or modular form. Eventually, all the storylines will converge in a timeline milestone, where the point of view might change again.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_473"/>


<div id="filepos563394" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Open structure</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">In an open structure, story elements are associated with different physical places, so the player can wander around <span class="italic">discovering</span> and <span class="italic">triggering</span> different elements of the story. Sometimes, stories with an open structure might not even have a story arc and the player is in total control of the hero's journey. It's up to the player to decide when to confront the various challenges and how. The journey can even never get to a proper end. This is the form typical of simulation-based games, strategy games, and some open world-based games, such as <span class="bold">massively multiplayer online role-playing games</span> (<span class="bold">MMORPGs</span>).</p><p class="calibre_2">It is worth noticing that, while an open structure seems not to follow the classic three-act story or monomyth models, there are always smaller pieces of the game experience that actually do.</p><p class="calibre_2">If you think about quests in an MMORPG, those are little <span class="italic">stories within the story</span> that usually follow quite perfectly the three-act model. Even games without quests that rely on emergent gameplay, such as a <span class="italic">Minecraft,</span> generate stories that follow a classic model. The stories created by the player in the moment of playing the game do precisely this. Just try to listen to any player talking about a gameplay experience he had in any game. Is his story following a model familiar to you?</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_475"/>


<div id="filepos565008" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">World state</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The idea of a world state comes straight from the notion of the State Machine.</p><p class="calibre_2">A State Machine is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.</p><p class="calibre_2">Imagine that the State Machine is your world (or story) and each state is a moving part of the narrative.</p><p class="calibre_2">In a traditional <span class="italic">branching narrative</span>, structured in a Tree, for example, a decision opens up a new branch of the three, which now requires moving on in a different direction from the other branches. In a narrative with states, a variable is generated to track the decision, and this variable will only affect the nodes in which it is referenced.</p><p class="calibre_2">Imagine a story where a character might either die or survive at a certain point. If the state of the story without such character is registered in a variable, the branch of the story might remain the same, but every time the character appears in a node the system can tell whether the character is actually there or not.</p><p class="calibre_2">You can imagine it like this:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00048.jpg" class="calibre_50"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">In the preceding example, something might happen in the nodes that affects the variables </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Var 1</span></span><span class="calibre4"> and </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Var 2.</span></span><span class="calibre4"> These events will affect later nodes that refer to that variable, therefore the narrative might change according to the state the world is in.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">An earlier decision might affect later decisions with no need to branch.</p><p class="calibre_2">Stories that rely on World State have the enormous advantage of offering meaningful replayability. In fact, even simple state changes might result in very different story developments if there are enough permutations to create more complex interactions between the states.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_477"/>

"Show, don't tell" is what many writers aspire to do. This principle applies not only to the actions of physical actors but also to the world, which in itself can be a very important (though sometimes underappreciated) actor.</p><p class="calibre_2">We are going to discuss this again and in more depth in the next chapter about level design, but for now, it is important to understand the concepts behind "telling stories through the environment."</p><p class="calibre_2">Of course, environmental storytelling is conveyed to the player through the game's level and environments.</p><p class="calibre_2">How can we achieve that?</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's have a look at a few practical examples:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Level geometry, artistic theme, and architecture</span>: These are not just a dressing for your gameplay, they affect the emotional state of your players and can also tell (or imply) a story of their own. It's essential to work closely with the art team (and especially the concept artists) to establish a set of backstories that could be told with each environment. Even if some players were to blast across the content with little attention to detail, an environment with a coherent backstory, art theme, and architecture will help immerse your audience:</li></ul><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre_51"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre4">

Do not be afraid to put things out of their place or proportion bring characterization. Is your NPC a maniac? Why don't you fill his bedroom full of nothing but teapots... Such cognitive dissonance.</p></li><li value="2" class="calibre_10"><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Writings</span>

<div id="filepos572870" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Narrative review process</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We have discussed how making video games is about creating, evaluating, and iterating to the find the optimal solution. Jonathan Dankoff, expert in User Research, and Corey May, games writer, game a very interesting talk at GDC 2015 (Game Developer Conference <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022166"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022166</tt></span></a>). They pointed out the importance of the implementation of a review process in video games narratives, to assess and address issues with the narrative during pre-production and develop a game with a clearer storyline.</p><p class="calibre_2">The framework was developed at Ubisoft, therefore it was meant for massive AAA productions, but the takeaways are very useful for games of any size. Underestimating the impact of the story is a common mistake, and the price is usually paid with stories of poor quality or the necessity to stretch the budget (both time and money) to sort out problems that could have been addressed early on with nearly no costs.</p><p class="calibre_2">A very similar idea was proposed by Mike Laidlaw, former creative director at <span class="italic">Bioware</span> on franchises such as <span class="italic">Mass Effect</span> and <span class="italic">Dragon Age,</span> during the game narrative summit at GDC 2018. He emphasized the importance of peer-reviewing the scripts of a game as early as possible during the production.</p><p class="calibre_2">The narrative review process consists of three steps on which the team should iterate one or two times:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Read</span>: Groups of different people read a general overview of the story</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Review</span>: The readers rate the story, make notes, or fill-questionnaires</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Analyze</span>: The reviews are discussed and the process is repeated (not more than once or twice) until all the biggest concern and issues are addressed</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Let's have a look at these steps in detail.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_481"/>


<div id="filepos575215" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Step one – Read</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The first step is to create an outline of the game story. One page per act or module would be enough. The idea here is to stay agile. The outline details all the story elements and how the story develops throughout the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">This outline is then given to two groups of readers:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Peer writers</span>: Knowledgeable about game writing, able to give technical feedback.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Team members</span>: Game director, game designers, level designers, leads. Everyone that would be involved in the decision-making process for the project, expect for writers.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_483"/>


<div id="filepos576134" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Step two – Review</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The reading groups give notes about the script. They might point out what they liked, what sparked their interest in knowing more, and what they didn't particularly understand or enjoy. They can put ask questions to the writer.</p><p class="calibre_2">A questionnaire can be also added to the script, to more empirically measure the level of enjoyment, interest, and comprehension.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_485"/>


<div id="filepos576740" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Step three – Analyze</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">All the notes given by the review groups are analyzed and synthesized into a report, which is then discussed at a roundtable.</p><p class="calibre_2">The report only contains constructive feedback and relevant issues. The idea is to discuss what to improve, not to collaboratively design the narrative with the review group.</p><p class="calibre_2">Both the writers and the reviewers participate in the roundtable, briefly discussing the major problems and even brainstorming possible solutions. A final assessment is made and a subsequent iteration is done by the writers on the script.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_487"/>


<div id="filepos577575" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The benefit of narrative review</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">This process has multiple benefits:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Early enough to act</span>: The process should happen early in production, meaning the story script is cheap to change and has very little to no impact on the game's production at this stage.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Meaningful feedback</span>: Feedback is practical, actionable, and given by experts.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Clear direction</span>: Organized feedback on the story means that writers can use it for future decisions. There is no guesswork on why some decisions were made.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Invest in the narrative</span>: The team will know the narrative and be invested in it early on. A better understanding of what the narrative is trying to accomplish will benefit game and level design and even art direction.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">This framework, as said, was developed and used for AAA productions such as <span class="italic">Assassin's Creed,</span> but games of any size will definitely benefit from a narrative review process as early as possible in the development.</p><p class="calibre_2">You don't have to follow each step exactly as described, or you might want to try this and then develop your own framework based on your experience. Whatever you choose to do, don't forget that, if you are developing a game with a deep and rich narrative, the writing process will need the same care as is devoted to gameplay.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">The screenshots used in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only.

<div id="filepos579726" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Summary</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We have taken a peek at how a narrative is designed for video games and how stories suit the video game medium very well. Of course, this is really just the tip of the iceberg. Interactive storytelling is a huge discipline, one that a game designer should know but not necessarily need to master unless he wants to specialize in writing or narrative design. For the reader who wants to delve deeper into it, we have established a few starting points.</p><p class="calibre_2">We looked at two common types of narrative: the three-act story, which has a beginning, a middle, and an end, through which the tension constantly builds up and reaches a final climax, and the monomyth, which is used to represent the archetypal hero's journey through an adventure that takes him out of his comfort zone into a new world of discovery and experiences, and back again.</p><p class="calibre_2">We went through the structure of different narratives in games, both linear and modular, and underlined the similarity between narrative and the game structure we discussed in previous chapters. Finally, we looked at a technique for reviewing narrative design, a process in which game designers should be always involved, especially when they're not the ones writing the story.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_491"/>
