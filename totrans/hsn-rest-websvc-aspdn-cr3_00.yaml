- en: .NET Core is a breath of fresh air for all the consumers of the Microsoft ecosystem.
    The old ASP.NET and .NET framework both have a long history. Over the years, the
    growth of the .NET framework and the long-time support constraints have resulted
    in odd implementations and hard-to-maintain web applications and web services.

- en: Furthermore, the strong dependency between .NET framework and the Windows OS
    has led to substantial limitations in the cloud technology world.

- en: .NET Core and ASP.NET Core are designed to evolve. They use abstract software
    development practices including open source, community-oriented approaches, as
    well as continuous improvement concepts. Today, ASP.NET Core is more flexible,
    fast, and powerful than ever. All the constraints developers had faced with .NET
    framework have been expelled and rewritten from scratch. Consequently, it is now
    possible to run .NET Core on every platform with no limitations. The framework
    is directly shipped with the .NET Core application. Therefore, it is possible
    to run it using a containerization approach. The documentation, the issues, and
    the roadmap are all available on GitHub. Microsoft is now following, by default,
    an open source way of working.

- en: I've been interested in .NET Core since the first release of the old DNX runtime.
    This book will introduce you to the power of ASP.NET Core and how to use its strength
    and flexibility to run web services. Furthermore, the book aims to fight the prejudices
    that people have regarding the .NET ecosystem and seeks to increase the adoption
    of .NET Core.
