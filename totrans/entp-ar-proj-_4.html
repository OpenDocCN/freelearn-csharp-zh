                    <h1 class="header-title">AR for Training with WebAR and Augmented Class!</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we will explore two different tools that work on Android devices that can be applied to the training field. The first one will be based on WebAR, specifically, the Google Web Component <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd>, which will let us visualize 3D models in a real environment through a web page using ARCore. We will be able to select a model from a series of them on the web page, place it in the real world, and manipulate it (move, rotate, and scale it).</p>
<p>The second one will be Augmented Class!, an educational-oriented authoring tool that will let us create AR training projects to show different elements (images, audio files, videos, and 3D models, among others) over images or real-life pictures, add interactivity to our projects, and exchange them between users.</p>
<p>The main goal of this chapter is to introduce you to two AR tools in a slightly different context than the rest of the chapters have. The main idea of this chapter is for you to discover other forms of AR that are different than the rest of the SDKs that we have covered or will be covering, and their value for such a transversal field as training. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create your own AR viewer through the web with ARCore, but you will have also discovered the possibilities of interactivity to enrich the user experience in AR applications using the Augmented Class! tool.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this book, both tools are under constant development and improvement, with new functionalities and integrations being added. Currently, they only work on Android devices, but it is expected they will soon work on iOS.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using AR for training</li>
<li>Exploring WebAR with Google Component <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>Exploring Augmented Class!</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Technical requirements</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The technical requirements for this chapter are as follows.</p>
<p>For the <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> project, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ARCore-supporting Android device (see the list here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices">https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices</a>). The project has been tested on a Pocophone F1.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Augmented Class! project, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Android device with Android 5.0 or above</li>
</ul>
<p>The resources and the code files for this chapter can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Enterprise-Augmented-Reality-Projects/tree/master/Chapter04">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Enterprise-Augmented-Reality-Projects/tree/master/Chapter04</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using AR for training</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>AR has been present in the educational field for more than 20 years, especially inside the university scope, although its growth has been much slower and less noticed than in more commercial fields such as marketing or tourism.</p>
<p>With the evolution of the supporting hardware (phones, tablets, and digital whiteboards, for example), AR has become a valuable asset in education and training. It allows students to visualize concepts in three dimensions over an image or directly in the room so that they can access information in a quicker and more dynamic way (just pointing with the camera instead of searching on a book or the internet for the information) or to create deeper personal projects (giving life to a painting, adding instructions or extra information over a handcrafted project, creating an animated presentation, and more).</p>
<p>One important consideration to make is that AR in education/training is transversal to all ages and subjects: a child can use it in the classroom to learn forms and colors, while a company can use it to train workers on its occupational risk prevention plan—it just depends on the tool and the target of the AR content.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will learn how to use two different and easy tools that will help us create two different educational projects in little time. For that, we will be using the following 3D models:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gearbox-planetary-2bee7992d266456aaef1f1394b0ebb98">https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gearbox-planetary-2bee7992d266456aaef1f1394b0ebb98</a></li>

<li><a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gearbox-conical-60f023924ee0456daa758eb590b6064b">https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gearbox-conical-60f023924ee0456daa758eb590b6064b</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's get started with WebAR by learning about what the Google Web Component <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> is and how it works.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Exploring WebAR with Google Web Component &lt;model-viewer&gt;</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Before smartphones hit the market, AR was exclusively developed on computers. Later on, web applications appeared, first written in Flash and then in HTML5, but always requiring the webcam from a computer. Since the appearance of the ARCore (Google) and ARKit (Apple) toolkits, AR is also arriving on smartphones through the web.</p>
<p class="mce-root">WebXR Device API is one of the current standards that's working to provide the specifications for accessing both VR and AR from the web, including the use of devices' sensors or <strong>head-mounted displays</strong> (<strong>HMDs</strong>). This standard specification is being written by the <strong>World Wide Web Consortium</strong> (<strong>W3C</strong>) and it's currently under development. At the time of writing, the integration of AR in this WebXR specification is still unstable and thus it's not presented in this chapter. It is expected that this functionality will be further developed during the following months. For more information on the standard and its progress, you can check their website (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr">https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr</a>) and GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/">https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/</a>).</p>
<p>In this section, for the development of a WebAR application, we will be using Google's <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> Web Component, which allows us to easily embed 3D models into a web page and visualize them in AR using a smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>A Web Component is a custom HTML element that is based on existing web standards and works across modern browsers. </p>
<p>Google's <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> Component was first launched in February 2019 to allow users to display 3D models in web pages. In May 2019, they announced AR compatibility through the <kbd>ar</kbd> attribute. It's based on the ARCore functionality Scene Viewer and at the moment it only works on Android devices that support this technology. We will see that its use is quite straightforward and works on any browser. In <a href="2d2b4e6f-1ee8-46ab-9041-24e36d57f949.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>AR for Manufacturing with ARCore</em>, we learned how to implement a whole AR mobile project. In this case, we will only have to use its web feature using the mentioned <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> Component. We will see which type of models we can use, how to create a web page to contain the component, and how to actually add the component and make it work on a mobile device.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Now that we have looked at the tool we are going to use, in the next section, we will cover the 3D models that are accepted by this component (at the time of writing).</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Working with 3D models</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Because we are displaying our models in the browser, the supported format is <strong>GL Transmission Format</strong> (<strong>glTF</strong>) 2.0/glb, a format that's designed to minimize the size and runtime processing, making it the best option for web transmission. Nowadays, many 3D designing programs such as Blender, 3ds Max, and Maya, as well as some 3D model platforms, such as Sketchfab, provide exporters to this format.</p>
<p>You can find more information on the functionality of glTF and its possibilities at <a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf/">https://www.khronos.org/gltf/</a> and <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/README.md</a>.</p>
<p>The 3D models' textures can be in <kbd>.jpg</kbd> or <kbd>.png</kbd> format, the tool supports animations, and, because models are going to be displayed via a web browser, they should not be very heavy on keeping the AR experience fluid.</p>
<p>More information on these requirements can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/scene-viewer">https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/scene-viewer</a>.</p>
<p>For this project, we are going to use three static models called <kbd>gearbox_conical.glb</kbd>, <kbd>gearbox_planetary.glb</kbd>, and <kbd>gearbox_worm.glb</kbd>. These models provide good detail for a more realistic AR experience, and we are going to use them in the project in the next section with Augmented Class!.</p>
<p>Now that we have understood the basics of how the <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> Component works, let's start creating a web page.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a simple web page</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The first thing we are going to do is create the web page where the 3D models will be displayed and ready to be launched in AR. For this, we are also going to use Glitch, an online tool that will help us create this project. </p>
<p>First, we are going to learn how to prepare a Glitch project before actually coding the style sheet and HTML page.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Coding with Glitch</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Glitch is a simple tool for creating web apps with a strong collaboration component. It allows us to remix existing apps or clone projects from services such as GitHub or GitLab. In our case, since we'll only want to create a simple demo web page, we will use Glitch to store both the HTML page and the 3D models. To create a new Glitch project, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, go to <a href="https://glitch.com/">https://glitch.com</a> and click on the Sign-in button. It will automatically create an account.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the top-right corner of the page, click on New Project to start a new project. Then, click on the first option, hello-webpage:</li>

<p>The Gitch board</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Take a look at the README file as it explains the main functionality of the page.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The next step will be to change the name of the project that Glitch has provided us. Click on the name in the top-left corner of the page and provide a name and description:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/e1bf670f-d670-4e47-a468-d0e9e939414b.png" style="width:16.00em;height:37.50em;"/></p>

<p>The window shows the code on the left and the result on the right</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Let's upload our models. Click on assets on the left-hand bar and drag and drop the three models of this project, that is, <kbd>gearbox_planetary.glb</kbd>, <kbd>gearbox_worm.glb</kbd>, and <kbd>gearbox_conical.glb</kbd>, onto the square:</li>

<p>Link to the assets and a button to delete it</p>
<p>Glitch saves every key we press, so there is no need for us to manually save the code.</p>
<p>With our basic elements ready, let's write the web page code, starting with the style sheet and then the HTML page.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Coding the style sheet</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the style sheet, we are going to decide on the appearance of our web page. Since our main goal is to show the AR, we will keep it simple for now. The Glitch <kbd>style.css</kbd> file will already have some code in it. Let's modify this file and adapt it to our needs. Follow these steps to do so:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are going to leave the body brackets as they are:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">body {<br/>  font-family: "Benton Sans", "Helvetica Neue", helvetica, arial, sans-serif;<br/>  margin: 2em;<br/>}</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Here, we specify the font we are going to use for the web page and the margins of the body element.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Next, we're going to modify the <kbd>h1</kbd> title element:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">h1 {<br/> text-align: center;<br/> color: #000000;<br/> font-style: bold;<br/>}</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now, the title will be centered, black, and in bold.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Let's add some class elements:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">.box{<br/>  max-width: 600px;<br/>  margin: 4em auto;<br/>  border-radius: 8px;<br/>  box-shadow: 3px 3px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);<br/>  text-align: center;<br/>  overflow: hidden;<br/>}</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This class will encapsulate the 3D models when they are displayed over the web page (not in AR). They will appear inside a box, with rounded borders and a soft shadow on it. The text we will add will be centered inside the box and the <kbd>overflow: hidden</kbd> parameter will prevent the content from overflowing from the box.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now, we'll add another class for the CC BY message of the models, which is required for these types of models:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">.cc{<br/>  display: flex;<br/>  justify-content: flex-start;<br/>  margin: 0.5em;<br/>  font-style: italic;<br/>}</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Here, we are locating the content on the left-hand side and with italic text.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>We'll also change the appearance of the <kbd>cc</kbd> class' images:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px" class="mce-root">.cc img{<br/> height: 1em;<br/> opacity: 0.6;<br/>}</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">With these two lines, we are selecting the <kbd>height</kbd> of the images inside this class and making them a little bit transparent.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Finally, we are going to modify the <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> Component's style:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">model-viewer {<br/>  width: 100%;<br/>  height: 580px;<br/>}</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">With this, we will make the model viewer take the <kbd>width</kbd> of the container box and set its <kbd>height</kbd>.</p>
<p>Now that the style sheet is ready, we can create our page.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Coding the index.html page</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Now open the <kbd>index.html</kbd> and, at the beginning of the document, change the title of the web page from <kbd>Hello!</kbd> to <kbd>AR Training Web App</kbd>. You can leave the rest of the code between the <kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd> <kbd>&lt;/head&gt;</kbd> tags as it is. Now, remove everything between the <kbd>&lt;body&gt;</kbd> <kbd>&lt;/body&gt;</kbd> tags (if you want, you can leave the last two lines with the Glitch button).</p>
<p>Now, let's add the title and the three boxes for the models inside the <kbd>&lt;body&gt;</kbd> tags:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the title between <kbd>&lt;h1&gt;</kbd> tags so that it uses our <kbd>.css</kbd> file's style:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">&lt;h1&gt;Select a gearbox to display in AR&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Now, after the title, add the first box with the title on top and the CC BY message at the bottom:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">&lt;div class="box"&gt;<br/>   &lt;h2&gt;Planetary Gearbox&lt;/h2&gt;<br/>   &lt;div class="cc"&gt; <br/>     &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank"&gt;<br/>         &lt;img src="img/cc.svg"&gt;<br/>         &lt;img src="img/by.svg"&gt;<br/>     &lt;/a&gt; <br/>     &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; <br/>     &lt;a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gearbox-planetary-2bee7992d266456aaef1f1394b0ebb98" target="_blank"&gt;T-FLEX CAD ST (Free)&lt;/a&gt;<br/>   &lt;/div&gt;<br/>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The main component is the <kbd>box</kbd> class. Inside it, we have the title in <kbd>&lt;h2&gt;</kbd> format and the <kbd>cc</kbd> class with a link to the license, the two images from <kbd>creativecommons</kbd> to identify the CC BY license type, and the author of the model with a link to the Sketchfab page where it comes from.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do the same for the other two models:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">&lt;div class="box"&gt; <br/>      &lt;h2&gt;Worm Gearbox&lt;/h2&gt;<br/>      &lt;div class="cc"&gt; <br/>        &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank"&gt;<br/>          &lt;img src="img/cc.svg"&gt;<br/>          &lt;img src="img/by.svg"&gt;<br/>        &lt;/a&gt; <br/>        &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;<br/>        &lt;a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/warm-gearbox-e7fedd86a90b4c46a53fe88882e66aa3" target="_blank"&gt;T-FLEX CAD ST (Free)&lt;/a&gt;<br/>      &lt;/div&gt;<br/>    &lt;/div&gt;<br/>    &lt;div class="box"&gt; <br/>      &lt;h2&gt;Conical Gearbox&lt;/h2&gt;<br/>      &lt;div class="cc"&gt; <br/>        &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank"&gt;<br/>          &lt;img src="img/cc.svg"&gt;<br/>          &lt;img src="img/by.svg"&gt;<br/>        &lt;/a&gt; <br/>        &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;<br/>        &lt;a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gearbox-conical-60f023924ee0456daa758eb590b6064b" target="_blank"&gt;T-FLEX CAD ST (Free)&lt;/a&gt;<br/>      &lt;/div&gt;<br/>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>At the moment, your project should look like this: </p>

<p>Now, we have to include the 3D models with the <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> Component.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding the &lt;model-viewer&gt; Component to our page</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Adding the <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> Component is quite straightforward. Follow these steps to do so:</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, we have to add the following two lines at the end of the <kbd>&lt;body&gt;</kbd> element:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">&lt;script type="module" src="img/model-viewer.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>&lt;script nomodule src="img/model-viewer-legacy.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<div><p style="padding-left: 60px">With these lines, we are adding the module to our page and making it work in new and old browsers.</p>
</div>
<p>If you want to work with a specific version of the module, add the version number on the URL after <kbd>model-viewer</kbd>, like this: <kbd>/model-viewer@0.3.1/</kbd><em>.</em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Then, we can call it inside the <kbd>box</kbd> class, after the <kbd>h2</kbd> title and before the <kbd>cc</kbd> class, making reference to the models' URLs (put your own model's URL in the <kbd>src</kbd> attribute):</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">&lt;model-viewer src="img/6f8eb042-0e74-4182-9d39-4f877746edb1%2Fgerabox_planetary.glb?v=1566506940560" alt="Planetary Gearbox" background-color="#42697b" auto-rotate camera-controls ar&gt;&lt;/model-viewer&gt; </pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The code interface can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<p style="color: black" class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1557 image-border" src="img/50393a44-4b8d-4d5b-ae13-926e3ae598b4.png" style="width:44.50em;height:25.08em;"/></p>
<p>Final code for the &lt;model-viewer&gt;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px" class="mce-root">As you can see, the <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> tag supports several attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">The <kbd>src</kbd>, <kbd>background-color</kbd>, and <kbd>alt</kbd> attributes define the source URL, the color of the background, and the description, respectively.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">The <kbd>auto-rotate</kbd> attribute will have the model rotating by default on the web page (flat view, not in AR).</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">With <kbd>camera-controls</kbd>, we can rotate/scale the model while it's in a flat view.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">The really important attribute for us here is <kbd>ar</kbd>; without it, the option of seeing the model in AR will not be available.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do the same with the other two models:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">...<br/>&lt;model-viewer src="img/6f8eb042-0e74-4182-9d39-4f877746edb1%2Fgearbox_worm.glb?v=1566506941410" alt="Worm Gearbox" background-color="#42697b" auto-rotate camera-controls ar&gt;&lt;/model-viewer&gt;<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>&lt;model-viewer src="img/6f8eb042-0e74-4182-9d39-4f877746edb1%2Fgearbox_conical.glb?v=1566506963689" alt="Conical Gearbox" background-color="#42697b" auto-rotate camera-controls ar&gt;&lt;/model-viewer&gt;</pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>With this, you should see the three models loaded and rotating on the web page:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1799 image-border" src="img/00de810c-5f91-45cd-b407-4b27285aeed6.png" style="width:29.75em;height:34.67em;"/></p>
<p>The web page with the 3D models in the display</p>
<p>We have finished coding. Now, let's take our mobile phone or tablet and see the models in AR.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Visualizing the 3D models in AR</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To see the models in AR, you need to open the web page with an ARCore-supporting device. Once you have one, the steps to visualize the model are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the URL to your final page by clicking on the Share button in the top-left corner of the Glitch web page and selecting Live App.</li>
<li>Now, copy the URL and paste it into your mobile device. You should see the 3D models loading (it might take a little more time than it would on a computer since they are detailed models):</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1112 image-border" src="img/ea44a044-896f-4568-8cfb-0c2fdf3f9d0e.png" style="width:15.92em;height:33.25em;"/></p>
<p>The web page displayed on the mobile phone</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>In the bottom-right corner of each model, you will see a little box that doesn't appear in the computer's browser. Click on it.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>The first time you do this, a message will appear, asking if the page can open Google Play Services for AR, and if you don't have it installed, it will ask you to install it:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1113 image-border" src="img/3ef307b0-1949-4243-9b65-b196ec49d48d.png" style="width:14.58em;height:9.50em;"/></p>
<p>Google Play Services for AR in the Google Play Store</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Now, you will see the 3D model in fullscreen, along with a button at the bottom to View in your space (AR). Click on it to launch the camera and point it at a flat surface:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1114 image-border" src="img/9912b89e-b83b-4d04-862b-0c880ab86492.png" style="width:12.33em;height:25.67em;"/></p>
<p>The model displayed fullscreen with the button to see it in AR below</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Once the model has been fixed to a surface, we can move around it. By touching the screen, you can move, rotate, and scale it:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1115 image-border" src="img/0c54e02a-e42b-4c49-920e-267d947930df.png" style="width:13.08em;height:27.25em;"/></p>
<p>The model in AR over the real floor</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Now, you can play with the size and position of the model to view it from different angles and to move inside it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Important! 3D models must be accessed through an HTTPS connection. Otherwise, when clicking on the little box in the bottom-right corner, the View in your space button won't appear for the model. Keep this in mind if you use your own server in a future application instead of Glitch.</p>
<p>And that's it. Now, you know how to display models in AR using the Web Component <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> and ARCore.</p>
<p>As we mentioned previously, the Component is quite new and constantly changing. To see the latest features and accepted properties, you can take a look at <a href="https://googlewebcomponents.github.io/model-viewer/">https://googlewebcomponents.github.io/model-viewer/</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/model-viewer">https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/model-viewer</a>.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will create another training project using the same 3D models but with the Augmented Class! tool instead. We will use an image marker and add interaction to our final project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Exploring Augmented Class!</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Augmented Class! is an educational authoring tool born from the motivation of a group of developers and teachers/professors and provides a complete solution that allows all the members of the educational community (teachers, students, and parents) to create and share interactive AR projects without technical knowledge and without the usual constraints of these kinds of tools, such as limited content and functionalities.</p>
<p>Currently, in its 3.0.30 version, it's freely available in the Google Play Store and in private beta versions for PC. The application uses image markers, which are known as targets in other tools. This means it displays the virtual content over a real image, such as a picture, book cover, and so on, instead of over a flat surface like ARCore does. Augmented Class! allows a wide variety of content (images, audio files, videos, 3D models, and text), also we can add interaction (touching the screen, playing with the distance from the camera to the marker, and playing with the distance between two markers) and share our projects between users. It's free in this version and it is expected they will launch more free and pro functionalities in the upcoming months. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.augmentedclass.com">www.augmentedclass.com</a>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will use the Android app to create a simple project to display a 3D model of a gearbox. Then, we will add user interaction to display further information. Finally, we will create another marker and create an interaction between them. For that, we will prepare our material (images and 3D models) on the mobile device, create a simple project, add some user interaction to it, and create an interaction between two different markers.</p>
<p>To do this, we'll need to prepare all the material for our mobile device.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Preparing the material</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Before we start the project, we have to prepare the material in our mobile device so that we can access it quickly:</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol>
<li>The first thing we need to do is register on their web page (<a href="http://creativitic.es/augmentedclass/beta/">http://creativitic.es/augmentedclass/beta/</a>) and download the Android app at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AugmentedClass.AClass&amp;hl=es_419">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AugmentedClass.AClass&amp;hl=es_419</a>. The app allows us demo access without us having to log in, but it has more restrictions for projects than it does with registered access.</li>
<li>Now, on your phone or tablet, create a folder called <kbd>AClass</kbd> in the <kbd>root</kbd> folder and copy the model file, <kbd>gearbox_worm.glb</kbd>, and the markers, <kbd>gearbox_worm.jpg</kbd> and <kbd>component_desc.jpg</kbd>, into it. Creating a folder isn't required, but it will make using and searching for content from the app easier.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, we are ready to start the app.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a simple project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We are going to start by creating a simple project to see how AR can be used in a training project using image-based markers. Let's get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the app, give the required permissions, and on the login page, enter the username and password you should have received from the email address you provided previously:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1116 image-border" src="img/176b10c4-dace-42e6-82dc-07ea605a653e.png" style="width:25.08em;height:12.33em;"/></p>
<p>Augmented Class! app login window</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The first time you open the app, you will be asked to complete a simple tutorial, where you have to follow some basic steps to create a very simple project with some given resources:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1117 image-border" src="img/0aa109d2-76c9-41e5-a5ab-e4486885ee0c.png" style="width:24.75em;height:12.50em;"/></p>
<p>Initial tutorial</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Once you have completed the tutorial, from the main menu, press Go to Inventor.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the inventor window, click on the created New Project to select it and delete it by pressing the delete icon:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1118 image-border" src="img/477c957e-61dd-4cb9-9e60-003382ecf632.png" style="width:25.92em;height:8.75em;"/></p>
<p>Inventor window with the project created and the tutorial deleted</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Now, click on Create a new project to enter the blackboard window.</li>
<li>Before anything else, give the project a name so that you can identify it later. </li>
<li>Here, we can select our type of marker. They are as follows: </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">Simple Marker: Shows the AR content over the selected image</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">Camera Interaction: Shows some AR content when the camera is far from the marker and another different AR content when the camera is close to the marker</li>

<p>Giving the project a name from the top bar</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>The first thing we need to do is select a marker. We could select a previous one, take a picture of an image from our camera, or upload a marker. Drag the square Load MARKER over the white square in the middle and select the <kbd>gearbox_worm.jpg</kbd> image from your mobile device:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1120 image-border" src="img/46224ee9-d4ed-431b-b7de-7a7fcc3120dd.png" style="width:31.58em;height:15.75em;"/></p>
<p>Dragging the Load MARKER square from the left scrollview to the middle</p>

<p>Dragging the Load model square to the marker in the middle</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Navigate to the <kbd>AClass</kbd> folder we created earlier and select <kbd>gearbox_worm.glb</kbd>. As you can see, many file types are accepted:</li>

<p>Selecting our 3D model</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Wait until the model has loaded. You will see that the model is selected by default and that new buttons are being displayed on the top bar. Select the hand icon to manipulate the model. Using the move/rotate/scale buttons, manipulate the gearbox until it looks as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1123 image-border" src="img/4ebf9ad2-f477-4853-8e24-8d1a6354bf98.png" style="width:34.92em;height:16.83em;"/></p>

<p>The viewer window with our project</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Since we only have one project and it's already selected, press the eye icon to load the AR. Then, point with the camera to the marker to see the 3D model appear over the image. Move and rotate the image and get closer to/further away from it to see the model from all angles:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1126 image-border" src="img/d6004136-857a-4321-a99b-86620169f8ec.png" style="width:26.08em;height:13.00em;"/></p>
<p>The gearbox appearing over the image marker</p>
<p>Both the inventor and the viewer windows have a printer button so that you can print a PDF with the markers in case you don't have them at hand.</p>
<p>That's it. We have the basic project ready. Now, let's add some interaction to it.</p>

<p>Now, we will create a marker interaction. We will have two markers: the model, as in the previous sections, and some simple text, <kbd>Component Description</kbd>.</p>
<p>For this example, we will keep it simple, and when we focus on the model's marker with the camera, it will show the 3D model. However, when we put both markers together, the description text will appear.</p>
<p>Because we are going to reuse our 3D model's marker, we will create another project. Inside a project, single markers can't be repeated as the viewer won't know which content it should display over the marker. Thus, we will start a new project and create the necessary interaction. Let's get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the project window, create a new project, and in the blackboard window, call it <kbd>Interactive Gearbox</kbd>. For this project, select two marker interactions:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1134 image-border" src="img/2512ed6f-4d84-4fa0-8a75-a03fd59703a4.png" style="width:36.42em;height:18.17em;"/></p>
<p>The new project with two markers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">As you can see, a new button will appear in the top-right corner: Separated/Together. This button will switch between the two modes (when the markers are separated and together), allowing us to place different content over the markers in each case.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Now, from the list of markers, make <kbd>gearbox_worm</kbd> the first marker:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1135 image-border" src="img/dc8bfb59-d2ca-4c74-9c55-2e1ac8ea2aff.png" style="width:36.92em;height:18.42em;"/></p>
<p>Dragging the previously uploaded gearbox_womr1 image onto the first marker</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now, drag the Load MARKER square onto the second one to load the <kbd>component_desc.png</kbd> picture on it:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1136 image-border" src="img/746b0a65-63b5-40de-a94f-db2e8fb404c7.png" style="width:39.42em;height:19.67em;"/></p>
<p>Dragging the Load MARKER square to load an image from the mobile device</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Press the 3D button and drag and drop the <kbd>gearbox_worm</kbd> model from the scrollview's end over the first marker. This will be our content for when markers are separated:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1137 image-border" src="img/6b8ca40b-b02d-4adf-b21c-268ad0a4bacf.png" style="width:37.92em;height:18.92em;"/></p>
<p>Dragging the previously uploaded model</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Now, click on the Together button to change to the content that's going to appear when we put them close to each other. You will see that the previous content will disappear from the scene:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1138 image-border" src="img/5674cd7f-dd59-4615-8be8-c69021e95e24.png" style="width:36.67em;height:18.25em;"/></p>
<p>The scene changed to the Together mode</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Repeat <em>step 4</em> to place the model over the first marker.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Select the text button and drag and drop one of the fonts over the first marker in two separate instances to create two different sets of text. Select and place them like so:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1139 image-border" src="img/8ac77d5b-9755-4c9f-b919-a4c4ec098226.png" style="width:37.33em;height:18.58em;"/></p>
<p>The scene with the model and the information text</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>You can make use of the camera's buttons to reduce the scene and see it from the top in order to place the text properly:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1140 image-border" src="img/abe72f57-a28d-4881-9ac5-51ae0427e8ef.png" style="width:37.75em;height:18.83em;"/></p>
<p>The same scene from above after changing the camera view</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>That's it. Now, press the save button and go back to the viewer window to launch the AR. Select the current project in the grid and press the eye icon:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1141 image-border" src="img/ac94cf3d-d136-4732-b4f2-d967c0076b09.png" style="width:29.33em;height:9.75em;"/></p>
<p>Selecting the current project to display in AR</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Now, you will see that, when they are separated, the gearbox shows the 3D model:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1142 image-border" src="img/d34a2090-b541-41e6-833c-55f5a8f4421d.png" style="width:32.50em;height:16.25em;"/></p>
<p>When the markers are separated, only the model appears</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Now, when they're put together, we're shown the 3D model and the text we added earlier:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1143 image-border" src="img/65df9321-4f28-48a6-831a-76ecfafb8c56.png" style="width:32.50em;height:16.33em;"/></p>
<p>When the markers have joined the model and the information is displayed</p>
<p>Beyond this example, this kind of interaction is very useful for complex explanations such as chemical reactions (we have different components that behave in one way when they are separated and in another way when they are together), for word-forming, for commands (we can have markers such as Component Description, Assembly, or Basic Maintenance and, depending on which one we put close to the model, different information will appear), and more.</p>

<p>So far, you've learned how to create a simple marker and two marker interactions, and added interaction for touchscreens. To do so, we've used a 3D model and some text, but you can try enriching the current projects with video files or audio explanations.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>On the other hand, Augmented Class! offers more options, including interaction with the camera (content changes when the camera is far from the marker and when it's close to it), delayed showing of the content (elements appear after a time and they can disappear again or not), and content editing (video and audio loop, text color and style, and so on). Once you've tried out all of these options and you're familiar with them, design and create a fully interactive project using every possible interaction.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, you have learned about two different tools for training projects. The first one is based on ARCore's web feature, which allows us, without having to code much, to add AR visualization to any 3D model that's displayed on a web page. The second tool, Augmented Class!, has allowed us to easily create interactive educational projects that can serve different purposes, such as learning the basics of a piece, training a maintenance engineer, and so on.</p>
<p>Now, you have a better understanding of the versatility of AR, how it can be used on mobile devices and through web apps, and how interaction can help create a deeper and more valuable experience. With the skills you've acquired in this chapter, you can try to migrate your projects into other areas and needs, as well as exploring both tools even further so that you can improve the current projects.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will start using the Unity 3D environment and some other AR tools that can be integrated into it. Here, you will learn how to use the EasyAR tool's image recognition process to create an AR catalog.</p>
