You created gameplay using Playmaker actions and Unity scripting. We also looked at making custom actions from C# scripts. You made a fully playable air hockey game with an AI opponent using all these tools.</p><p>In this chapter, we are going to talk about networking. You will make a multiplayer mode for the game using <a id="id143" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Photon Unity Networking</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>PUN</strong></span>), which is a helpful plugin that comes with Playmaker and lets you make multiplayer games almost effortlessly. We will also talk about the theory of networking in games and discuss Unity native networking as an alternative to Photon.</p><p>In this chapter, you will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding networking and multiplayer</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up Photon Unity Networking</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Making a multiplayer game</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Understanding networking and multiplayer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec30"/>Understanding networking and multiplayer</h1></div></div></div><p>Explaining things like TCP/IP and <a id="id144" class="indexterm"/>other low-level networking concepts<a id="id145" class="indexterm"/> is beyond the scope of this book, and we are going to try and keep everything as close to practical application as possible. On the other hand, it will be much easier for you to build multiplayer if you are familiar with at least some theory.</p><p>The first thing that you need to know is what servers and clients are. In simple terms, a server<a id="id146" class="indexterm"/> is a computer that responds to network requests from other computers, or more precisely, a system that responds to network requests from other systems, because you may have multiple servers and multiple clients on the same computer. This means that clients communicate with each other through a server. Typically, player systems are clients in multiplayer games, while servers are on computers that are accessed remotely. Sometimes, a player can <span class="emphasis"><em>host</em></span> a game, in which case the player either acts as a server or simply tells the server to reserve its resources for the game.</p><p>You may have heard about network architectures before. In games, the most popular architectures are arguably client-server and peer-to-peer. The former means that all the clients subscribe to a single server. The server hosts most of the important information about the game and distributes it between the players. The latter is about peers (players) connecting to one another directly, so all the clients are connected to each other, and the network workload is distributed evenly.</p><p>The advantage of client-server<a id="id147" class="indexterm"/> is that it allows creating a more stable system that ensures that cheating is either impossible or very hard, as well as makes it easier for the developer to monitor everything and make changes to the game on the fly. This method, however, is generally expensive and relatively hard to implement yourself if you are just a solo developer who is learning to make his/her first multiplayer game.</p><p>Peer-to-peer<a id="id148" class="indexterm"/> does not require having a powerful server hosting multiple game sessions at the same time, allowing players to connect to each other, distributing the network workload between them. The drawback of peer-to-peer is that it tends to be less stable, and it is relatively hard to monitor. On top of that, you still need a server if you want to keep track of game sessions, perform matchmaking, and let your players play on the Internet instead of just a local network.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip23"/>Tip</h3><p>It is hard to connect to the Internet without having a server, because of something <a id="id149" class="indexterm"/>called <span class="strong"><strong>Native Address Translation</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NAT</strong></span>). Without getting into much detail, it should be noted that it is something that network routers do, and most of us have routers these days. A process commonly called <span class="strong"><strong>NAT punchthrough</strong></span><a id="id150" class="indexterm"/> is used in order to connect one computer to another, and this process requires a server acting as a mediator for the first connection between two computers.</p></div></div><p>In Unity, it is relatively easy to set up a <span class="strong"><strong>Local Area Network</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>LAN</strong></span>)<a id="id151" class="indexterm"/>, peer-to-peer<a id="id152" class="indexterm"/> connection, or client-server connection with one of the players hosting the game without using any external plugins. A LAN connection means that all the players are connected to the same local computer network. Unfortunately, whatever you do, you will need a server to make sure that players can always connect to each other over the Internet, which is what we want to do. Photon takes client-server and wraps it in an extremely easy to use interface that allows anyone to create multiplayer games without any prior experience. On top of that, it is very affordable for what it is.</p><p>Some of the Photon services allow players to host their own servers, but those take some time to set up. What we are going to use in this book is Photon Cloud. As the name implies, all the game sessions happen in the cloud, thus on remote Photon servers. All you need to do is synchronize your game's data through them and make sure that players can find each other. You do not need to set up a server, and you do not have to worry about the problems involved in making peer-to-peer multiplayer.</p><p>The way the synchronization works is that there is something called <span class="strong"><strong>Network View</strong></span><a id="id153" class="indexterm"/> (<span class="strong"><strong>Photon View</strong></span> in Photon), which is a component that makes one or more game object's properties synchronized over the network. When such a property changes in one client, it changes in all the clients, with the server keeping track of everything and sending commands to clients. For example, mallet's position can be such a property. This way, when player 1 moves their mallet, player 2 sees them move it and vice versa. The same goes for almost any other property.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip24"/>Tip</h3><p>As we will show in this chapter's example, synchronizing positions can be okay for player objects (such as mallets in air hockey or characters in first person shooters), but objects that have physical behaviors (such as the puck), can experience serious network delays on remote computers. There is currently no easy solution for this problem apart from using Unity native networking.</p></div></div><p>There are objects that <a id="id154" class="indexterm"/>can belong to the scene (like the walls and the background) and so are exactly the same and unchangeable throughout all clients, and then there are objects that belong to different clients, such as the mallets. Generally, you want to synchronize as little data over the network as possible in order to avoid high response times. Scene objects do not have to get synchronized since they do not change. Moreover, this way each player's mallet responds only to that player's input, which makes perfect sense gameplay-wise.</p><p>You are now ready to start setting up Photon. All this theory may sound complicated, but it really comes down to synchronizing variables over the network using a special Photon component called Photon View.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" title="Making multiplayer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec32"/>Making multiplayer</h1></div></div></div><p>There are a few game objects<a id="id159" class="indexterm"/> that have to be synchronized in our game, including the goals, the puck, and the mallets. We also need to make a few adjustments to the scene and set up matchmaking.</p><p>We are going to use the Photon Playmaker example as a template for our game, using the scenes from there and modifying them to suit our purposes. This is generally a good idea if you want to set up multiplayer quickly, because these examples feature numerous and complex FSMs that would take quite a lot of time to set up, while most of the things you will need have already been implemented.</p><p>You can download the demo scenes here: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.hutonggames.com/samples.php">http://www.hutonggames.com/samples.php</a>.

Do the same for <span class="strong"><strong>GoalTriggerRight</strong></span>.</p><p>Now your multiplayer should be set up. Before testing everything, confirm that you have copied all of the files over from the <span class="strong"><strong>Multiplayer</strong></span> scene correctly. Make sure that there is a game object called <span class="strong"><strong>PlayMakerPhotonProxy</strong></span> in both <span class="strong"><strong>demo_lobby</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>demo_room</strong></span> scenes. If it is missing in one of the scenes, add it by going to <span class="strong"><strong>PlayMaker</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Addons</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Photon Networking</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Components</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Add Photon proxy to scene</strong></span> from the main menu, then save the scene.</p><p>You can test it by making a build and opening it in your browser while launching the game in the Editor. Make sure you always start from the <span class="strong"><strong>demo_lobby</strong></span> scene, because otherwise the matchmaking will not work.</p><p>You will see that the mallets' and the puck's positions are synched over the network. That is, they move simultaneously in both Editor and web browser. You will also notice that the movement of the remote object is somewhat jerky and imprecise (especially the puck on the host's client). This is due to the inevitable network delay and physics data being calculated more often than Photon packages are being sent. At the moment the only real solution to this problem is switching to Unity native networking, which, however, requires that you have your own server if you want the game to work over the Internet.</p><p>The place where the objects' movement is smoothed out is the <span class="strong"><strong>Position synch</strong></span> FSM of <code class="literal">Puck</code> and <code class="literal">Mallet</code> prefabs. If you look at the <span class="strong"><strong>get player position</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Set player position with lerp states</strong></span> of these state machines, you will see that, if the object was first created on the local machine, its position gets saved in a variable every frame and synched over the network. If the object does not belong to the player's client, the variable is read, and then the position of the local copy of the object is interpolated.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip27"/>Tip</h3><p>You could try changing the <span class="strong"><strong>Amount</strong></span> property of the <span class="strong"><strong>Vector3 Lerp 2</strong></span> action in the <span class="strong"><strong>Set player position with lerp</strong></span> state. This variable determines the precision of the interpolation. If you want to know more about the way PUN works under the hood, make sure you consult its online documentation that explains every state machine in the demo scenes in great detail: <a class="ulink" href="https://hutonggames.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W927">https://hutonggames.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W927</a></p></div></div><p>As you can see, <a id="id167" class="indexterm"/>Photon networking is quite easy to set up, but is not a very good solution for games that require physics simulation. This is mostly due to cloud server limitations and limited integration with the Unity engine. Most simple games that don't rely on physics so heavily can benefit from Photon greatly. In other cases, Unity native networking should be used. More information about it can be found in the Network Reference Guide section of the Unity documentation: <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/NetworkReferenceGuide.html">http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/NetworkReferenceGuide.html</a></p><p>Playmaker is capable of working with native Unity networking as well. You can check the <span class="strong"><strong>Network</strong></span> section of the <span class="strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span> panel for the list of available Playmaker actions and compare them with the actions described in the reference material.</p></div>
