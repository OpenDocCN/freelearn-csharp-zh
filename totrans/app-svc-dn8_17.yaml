    applications, like gRPC for efficient communication between services, caching
    of various types, and fault tolerance using Polly.

- en: 'As you implement more and more of these technologies, managing your development
    environment gets harder and harder. Connection strings, secret keys, port numbers,
    rate limiting, and caching configurations: if any are wrong, things break, or
    work in unexpected ways, and it can be hard to identify and then fix the issue.'

    that will apply to all projects, and an Aspire host to manage everything.'

    know these days, it would be great to attempt to implement a project that needs
    a mix of technologies and skills. It should be as real as possible, be cool, fun,
    and practical, and have already been implemented by others with public products
    that we can be inspired by.

    (**GA**) release of .NET 10 in November 2025\. While I do not expect major new
    features at the level of the unification of the Blazor hosting models, I do expect
    .NET 9 and .NET 10 to make worthwhile improvements to all aspects of .NET.
