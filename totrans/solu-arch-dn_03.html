			<p>In the previous chapter, we covered all the essential phases of the software development life cycle. Now, let's get to know the different team roles contributing to the execution of these different phases.</p>
			<p>Employees are the most important assets of an organization. One of the key factors of a successful software project is ensuring that the key members of the development team are all in place. The success of a project also depends on how well the team collaborates and communicates efficiently in order to deliver the best outcome. This chapter focuses on the main roles within a typical software development team and their corresponding responsibilities.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exploring the development team hierarchy</li>
				<li>Highlighting the five key attributes to consider when assembling a team</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have learned about the typical hierarchy within a software development team and what to expect in terms of the responsibilities of each member. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Exploring the development team hierarchy</h1>
			<p>In many situations, clients<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> wonder why we allocate different roles and specialties to build a product. Indeed, they expect that a software engineer role is enough. This chapter is intended to answer this concern and to highlight the specific role that every member plays in an Agile development team in order to deliver the best possible performance.</p>
			<p>Typically, when you start assembling a software development team, the decision to choose the roles, along with the responsibilities of each member, depends on the answers to these two questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">What type of product will you develop?</em></li>
				<li><em class="italic">What is the methodology of work that will be used?</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following diagram<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> shows the key positions of an Agile software development team. You will notice that we have highlighted the solution architect position; they play a liaison role between the technical and non-technical teams. This is the person who will design the architecture of the solution:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1: The development team hierarchy </p>
			<p>Let's dive deeper into each role and its responsibilities within a team.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>The project manager – the godfather</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">project manager</strong> (<strong class="bold">PM</strong>) is an organized<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> and detail-oriented individual with good knowledge of project<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> estimation techniques. The PM is responsible for knowing the key stakeholders of the project and effectively communicating with each of them to plan, schedule, prepare the budget, execute tasks, and ensure the delivery and completion of the software product.</p>
			<p>The duties and responsibilities<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> of the PM<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> can include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Planning the entire phases of the project from analyzing requirements to testing and maintenance</li>
				<li>Deciding on the methodology that will be used for the project in coordination with the client</li>
				<li>Allocating all the resources that are needed for the successful completion of the project and ensuring they have the right environment in terms of software tools and hardware to implement and test the project</li>
				<li>Proposing the project timeline and scheduling the tasks of each phase</li>
				<li>Leading and supervising the successful execution of each phase of the project by assigning tasks to team members and ensuring they are delivered on time</li>
				<li>Motivating team members to deliver good quality output</li>
				<li>Creating the project budget and providing regular status reports to senior management</li>
				<li>Ensuring the requirements are fully understood by the team members, making and communicating change requests, and ensuring the alignment of the output with the client's expectations</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, as per the team hierarchy, we will examine the functional analyst role.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>The functional analyst – the explorer</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">functional analyst</strong> is responsible for ensuring that all requirements have been thoroughly discussed<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> and analyzed<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> with the client. After doing so, the requirements are captured, documented correctly, and communicated clearly to the team before the kick-off of any development activity.</p>
			<p>They play an important role in translating the business processes, no matter how complex they are, into logical and functional requirements that can be developed by the tech team. Their role is to bridge the gap between the business users and their expectations with the development team, which is responsible for building the product.</p>
			<p>This role might have different<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> titles, such as<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> requirements analyst, system analyst, or business analyst, but they all, more or less, deal with the same responsibilities.</p>
			<p>Some of the duties<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> of the functional analyst include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Meeting with the client stakeholders, managerial team, and business users and gathering requirements</li>
				<li>Identifying the primary goals of the product to build</li>
				<li>Analyzing technical and business requirements and documenting them</li>
				<li>Ensuring that the requirements are properly communicated and explained to the development team</li>
				<li>Testing the final product to validate the objectives and guarantee the compliance of the outcome with the business goals of the client and their users</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we will explore the responsibilities of the solution architect.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>The solution architect – the game changer</h2>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">solution architect</strong> is responsible<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> for leading the technical design and managing the overall engineering side of the solution concerning<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> specific business requirements.</p>
			<p>This team member should have a balanced combination of technical and business skillsets in order to create the solution architecture. </p>
			<p>A solution architecture can be a multipart process with a wide range of issues that are focused on particular audiences and business objectives. Therefore, the main focus is to analyze and understand all parts of the business model, including all of the requirements defined in the early stages.</p>
			<p>Then, they need to design a specific solution and introduce the overall technical vision for the solution that should fit the current environment along with the client's expectations. The solution<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> architecture will be communicated to the rest of the development team, who will then use the design specifications, in addition to the requirements, to implement<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> the solution.</p>
			<p>Some of the duties<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> of the solution architect include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Analyzing and understanding the requirements and then proposing an architectural design of the solution</li>
				<li>Assessing the current technologies and systems in place to introduce integration links between the product to be built and the existing systems to meet the client's needs</li>
				<li>Being transparent to all stakeholders and informing them about any technical issues with the current product being implemented and then proposing solutions</li>
				<li>Taking technical decisions after assessing the business impact they might have on the final product</li>
				<li>Documenting proposed solutions and monitoring all requested updates to make sure that they have no impact on the overall design of the solution</li>
				<li>Recommending the right hardware for the product to function properly and coordinating with the IT professionals to prepare the necessary environment to build, test, and host the product</li>
				<li>Tackling common project challenges, such as team skills, communication conflicts, unclear requirements, and unrealistic deadlines</li>
				<li>Identifying possible risks in advance to prevent any surprises during the implementation</li>
				<li>Coordinating with the project manager and team leader to prepare the project timeline and detailed scheduling, which will be the main input for pricing the work needed</li>
				<li>Coordinating with the developers and team leaders to resolve technical problems as they arise</li>
				<li>Guiding the development<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> team by regularly researching existing technologies and proposing changes and new techniques to the development team to improve processes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This role requires deep<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> technical knowledge<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> and hands-on experience<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> in the following areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Business analysis to help understand and improve the business processes by translating them into functional use cases</li>
				<li>IT infrastructure to recommend the right environment for the product</li>
				<li>Software architecture design to propose a modern solution architecture for the product</li>
				<li>Cloud development to develop and deploy solutions to the cloud, as well as streamline the <strong class="bold">SDLC</strong> when shifting to the cloud</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> to help to improve the Agile development life cycle</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we will get to know the responsibilities of the development lead.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>The development lead – the tech-savvy one</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">development lead</strong> is responsible for leading and supporting the developers to implement<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> all the technical aspects of the product. However, before starting the development, they work closely to provide an accurate estimation<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> for the work that is needed. This assessment is used by the project manager to create the project timeline and provide a structured breakdown of all tasks.</p>
			<p>The technical lead should effectively communicate with the project manager to provide regular progress reports of the development activities. On the other hand, the technical lead should also communicate with the solution architect so that technical issues, changes, or conflicts can be tackled at the right time and in a professional manner.</p>
			<p>One of the main responsibilities<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> of the technical lead is to enforce the coding standards and best practices with the team members and to ensure that they are clear and easy to apply so that the developed code can be reusable, readable, and extendable at any point in time.</p>
			<p>Some of the duties<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> of the development lead include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Managing day-to-day assignments and organizing team initiatives</li>
				<li>Conducting technical training sessions to coach team members on new technologies and techniques and ensuring they all apply the same standards</li>
				<li>Evaluating the performance of the team and suggesting improvements and goals</li>
				<li>Continuously listening<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> to team members' feedback and concerns to resolve any issues or conflicts that might affect the team's spirit or the progress of work</li>
				<li>Motivating team members to improve their analytical thinking and creativity</li>
				<li>Suggesting and organizing team-building activities</li>
				<li>Developing team strengths and improving weaknesses</li>
				<li>Recognizing team achievements and coordinating with the management to reward accomplishments</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we will explore the career tracks of software developers. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Software developers – the masters of magic</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Software developers</strong> are responsible for properly understanding the requirements defined in the early stages<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> of the project. Then, they begin developing the modules and functionalities as per the schedule that has been agreed with the project manager and the client. Any ambiguity<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> in the requirements that can't be clarified by the team lead should be discussed with the functional analyst or the solution architect. This is very important in order<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> to reduce project risks and to ensure good quality deliverables, which will lead to the success of the project.</p>
			<p>There are three career tracks<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> for a software developer to follow:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Frontend</strong>: In this case, they are responsible for delivering the client-side blocks of the product. Usually, they use frontend programming languages<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>, such as <strong class="bold">HTML</strong> and <strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong>. They should be skilled in <strong class="bold">jQuery</strong>, <strong class="bold">CSS</strong> (<strong class="bold">SASS</strong> or <strong class="bold">LESS</strong>), and responsive frameworks, such as Bootstrap. In modern web development, frontend developers are very popular with the existence of JavaScript frameworks, such as Angular, React, and Vue, which are used to build single-page web applications:<p>a. <strong class="bold">Angular</strong>: This is an open-source JavaScript framework developed by the Angular<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> team at <strong class="bold">Google</strong>.</p><p>b. <strong class="bold">React</strong>: This is an open-source JavaScript framework developed<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> by the React team at <strong class="bold">Facebook</strong>.</p><p>c. <strong class="bold">Vue</strong>: This is an open source<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> MVVM JavaScript framework created by Evan You, who formerly worked for Google on the <strong class="bold">AngularJS</strong> framework.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Backend</strong>: In this case, they are responsible for developing the server-side functionalities and blocks of the product, such as the web services or the web API. They are also responsible for designing and creating the databases, including all SQL<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> queries and transactions. Some of the main programming languages<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> and skills that every backend developer should have include the following:<p>a. .NET C# (.NET Framework and .NET Core)</p><p>b. ASP.NET MVC and Web API</p><p>c. N-tier architecture</p><p>d. Entity Framework and ADO.NET</p><p>e. MSSQL databases and queries</p><p>f. Azure Blob storage, Azure App Service, and Azure Functions</p><p>g. Microsoft Power Automate</p><p>h. Deploying Docker containers on Azure</p><p>i. Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and jQuery</p><p>j. A JS Framework such as React, Angular, or Vue</p><p>k. Unit testing</p><p>l. Team Foundation<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> Server or Git for source code control and versioning</p><p>m. Azure DevOps to manage the source code or the development cycle</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Full-Stack</strong>: This role<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> is a combination of the previous two tracks.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some of the duties and responsibilities<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> of the software developer<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Researching, designing, and implementing clean and efficient code based on the requirements, specifications, and coding standards</li>
				<li>Coordinating with the team lead on assignments and the day-to-day schedule</li>
				<li>Troubleshooting the code to fix reported issues with the ability to propose workarounds</li>
				<li>Deploying and testing the product in the test environment as well as in the production environment</li>
				<li>Providing professional code documentation and supporting the preparation of the user guide documentation</li>
				<li>Contributing to the code review sessions to improve quality and enhance overall performance.</li>
				<li>Providing status reports to the team lead, as needed, on a daily or weekly basis.</li>
				<li>Coordinating<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> with the team lead to solve any blocking issues that need advanced expertise to be resolved.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we will learn about the responsibilities of QA engineers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Quality assurance – the quality guards</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">QA engineers</strong> or <strong class="bold">software testers</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> responsible<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> for conducting full cycle testing for a product to ensure that all requirements and use cases have been developed and that the product is free of defects. To achieve this target, they should create test cases out of the requirements or the use cases. The goal<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> is to test every single function or process in the product and then coordinate with the developers to provide steps in which to reproduce the defects. Once the defects are fixed by the developers, the QA team should conduct another cycle of testing to confirm the fixes.</p>
			<p>Some of the duties<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> of QA<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/> engineers include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Coordinating with IT professionals to ensure that the testing environment is ready before starting the testing of the product</li>
				<li>Creating test cases and running test plans to test all the functionalities of the product</li>
				<li>Identifying the defects and logging all the steps and details to help the developers resolve these defects</li>
				<li>Monitoring performance and generating metrics, which will help to improve the efficiency of the product</li>
				<li>Conducting security testing to identify security threats and prevent vulnerabilities</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So far, we have discussed the various roles, along with their specialties, of a typical Agile team. In the next section, we will highlight certain personality traits and additional things to consider when assembling a team to build your product.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Highlighting the five key attributes to consider when assembling a team </h1>
			<p>Building an effective and goal-oriented team with a clear purpose can be challenging because it brings together different cultures, attitudes, and communication skills. If you talk to senior managers who are responsible for managing teams, they will tell you that the most significant problems they face<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> are related to the communication issues and internal processes adopted by the team to do the work that is needed. That's why it is important to have, within your processes, a kind of protocol, team norms, standards, or best practices that can assist the team to get along and build effective interpersonal relationships to accomplish their goals.</p>
			<p>In the following subsections, we'll walk through some key attributes that need to be considered when you're assembling a software development team.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Building a great team culture</h2>
			<p>Hiring team members<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> based on their technical qualifications is important. However, you don't want to hire a team<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> that has no harmony and can't communicate as one entity to properly achieve your goals. </p>
			<p>Build a strong team by choosing members who have chemistry, can work together, have the same vision, and can collaborate effectively. Support your company culture by considering the following personal traits when evaluating candidates:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Has a positive attitude</li>
				<li>Is a team player</li>
				<li>Is self-motivated</li>
				<li>Has a strong work ethic</li>

			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Establishing development standards and best practices</h2>
			<p>Having rules and standards<a id="_idIndexMarker140"/> can lead<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> to good results and better code maintainability. There are a lot of common standards out there that you can apply. However, it is important to keep the standards relevant, simple, and clear<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> to everyone on the team.</p>
			<p>As for the best practices, they are<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> a set of methods<a id="_idIndexMarker144"/> or techniques that have either shown a good outcome or an improvement to the process. Therefore, it is recommended that you analyze the current processes in place and suggest best practices based on previous experiences.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Equipping the team with the right tools</h2>
			<p>They say <em class="italic">you're only as good as the tools you use</em>, so it is vital that you provide your team with tools<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> that can help to improve team collaboration and allow your team to perform tasks more effectively, which will reduce the turnover. </p>
			<p>Here is a list of must-have and recommended tools that will support you in the building of your .NET product: </p>
