    .NET, and ASP.NET Core for modern web development. The ninth edition for .NET
    9 is a small update from the 8^(th) edition because .NET 9 is a Standard Term
    Support release (only 18 months). It includes the errata and improvements listed
    since the publishing of the 8^(th) edition, which can be found at the following
    link: [https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/errata/README.md](https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/errata/README.md).'

    testing from unit and integration to performance and web UI testing, and then
    topics like Docker and .NET Aspire. Finally, it looks at how to prepare for an
    interview to get the .NET developer career that you want. This book will not be

    popular third-party packages including Serilog and Noda Time. It shows you how
    to build native AOT-compiled services with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs and how to
    improve performance, scalability, and reliability using caching, queues, and background
    services. It covers implementing more services using GraphQL, gRPC, SignalR, and
    Azure Functions. Finally, it shows you how to build graphical user interfaces
    for websites and desktop and mobile apps with Blazor and .NET MAUI. This book
