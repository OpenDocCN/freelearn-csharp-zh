    accounts of that company and the chart of accounts defined on the consolidated
    company. The translation is done on each G/L account card, on the **Consolidation**
    FastTab. You can define different destiny accounts for debit and credit balances.

    We explored how VAT entries are created when taxes are involved and how we can
    use them to report taxes to the authorities. We saw how to create a fixed asset
    and post its acquisition cost, revaluate it, calculate its depreciation, sell
    it, or cancel wrong entries.

    perform in order to close the fiscal year, and in the inventory valuation section
    we came across different costing methods and how to reflect item costs into the
    general ledger. Finally, we have seen how to perform the consolidation of different
