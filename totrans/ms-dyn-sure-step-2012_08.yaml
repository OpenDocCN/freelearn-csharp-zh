    in terms of project management fundamentals. It offers an inside view of the project
    management disciplines, the project management processes, and organizational change
    management. It provides knowledge and best practices and is designed to act as
    a constant source of inspiration for project managers seeking to continuously
    improve their project management skills. You can compare it with the *Project
    Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide)* by *Project Management Institute (PMI)*,

    It may seem like a trivial question, but it is not. Project management is a true
    profession; it is not just something that you can do as a side activity. Over
    the years, the community of professional project managers has increased significantly,
    indicating that a continuously growing number of professionals do understand the
    true essence and importance of successful project management. But despite this
    positive evolution, some managers still seem to ignore this and continue to manage
    their projects while neglecting best practices. For those who do recognize project
    management as a true profession and seek to improve their skills, and are eager
    to learn new things and find inspiration to take their project management knowledge
    to higher levels, the Project Management Library is an excellent knowledge hub.

    is the **Change Request** form, available in two versions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first Change Request form brings our attention to the trade-off matrix.
    Change requests mostly seem to only address the cost impact to the customer. However,
    change impacts more than budget; it can have an impact on the complexity of the
    scope, the deployment of skills and resources, and the schedule. We need to investigate
    these other impact elements as well and monitor how a set of changes might impact
    us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second available template allows a more detailed description of the change
    and the trade-off analysis than the previous template. So, we might consider this
    one when facing larger changes with significant impact that needs extensive and
    in-depth documentation. This template not only teaches us that it is a good idea
    to investigate all impacts of making the change but also that analyzing the impact
    of not making the change is equally valuable. A customer organization needs to
    be aware that in the course of an implementation, visions and ideas might alter,
    leading to changed and additional requirements. However, the incremental scope
    benefits may not always be worth implementing. Some requests might not have a
    significant impact on the efficiency of the company or the goals and objectives
    of the decision maker while representing a vast impact on the project and its
    risks. Analyzing the impact of not implementing those changes reduces potential
    risks and the scope creep in general.

    manage initial and ongoing time and cost management. Any manager engaged in a
    project will and must be concerned about the time and budget constraints of the
    assignment. In a way, they will all manage it even without having a clue about
    the fundamentals and best practices described for this discipline. This activity
    is omnipresent and some even (unjustly) narrow down project management to time
    and cost management. So yes, it is important. And, the more we improve our skills
    to manage time and cost the more possibilities we will have to control our time
    and cost performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The first lesson to learn is that the initial time and cost management must
    be in line with the ongoing time and cost management. A common basis is needed
    for both the initial and ongoing time and cost management; this is where the **Work
    Breakdown Structure** (**WBS**) comes in. The WBS defines all deliverables and
    activities necessary to deliver the requested value to the customer. It is the
    basis for estimation and follow up in our project and allows the setup of a common
    language among project stakeholders. If the breakdown of our deliverables in the
    beginning differs significantly from the follow-up breakdown in the ongoing project,
    we might expect problems as we will have a difficult job aligning time and cost
    performance with the performance we had planned for. A simple search instruction
    in the Sure Step content reveals how important the WBS is. Searching on WBS generates
    a result of over 30 Sure Step activities, as shown in the following screenshot:'

    is generally accepted as a true challenge. At moments characterized by great uncertainty,
    we need to estimate cost and time durations. It would be great if we could produce
    estimates at times where all scope and risks were certain. But unfortunately,
    we are not granted that privilege. Therefore, we need to rely on our estimation
    efficiency. A good estimate is really important for both the consulting and customer
    organization, making a good estimation process a *sine qua non*. This Sure Step
    discipline introduces the reader to generally accepted estimation techniques such
    as the use of consulting experts, estimates from similar projects, parametric
    estimating, and bottom-up and top-down estimating. It also gives attention to
    the challenges of estimating in an Agile context and provides solid tips such
    as the use of a three-point analysis and the involvement of the customer in the
    estimation process.

    and how to prepare project tracking and reporting. Sure Step highlights the importance
    of structured and well-documented estimation and tracking techniques. Not only
    do we benefit from these techniques in a single project, but as a historic reference,
    they will also have great value for future estimates. We might also get inspired
    by the content that is provided on the **Earned Value Concept**, a method that
    integrates project scope, cost, and schedule in order to generate early warning
    signals by project tracking. This method identifies what we have delivered as
    per what we have spent and calculates how much more time and cost we will need
    when progressing with the same performance.

    and improve the quality up to the required and balanced level. **Quality Assurance**
    (**QA**) is considered as the master plan to meet the project''s requirements
    and quality standards. It is often defined as the planned and systematic activities
    implemented in a quality system so that the quality requirements for a product
    or service will be fulfilled. In a way, implementation guided by Sure Step processes
    can be considered as an element of QA. However, this is not enough as we have
    to tune our planned approach with the specific quality expectations and demands
    of our customer. This means that first we need to understand what quality means
    to our customer and only then can we further refine our proactive quality approach.
    Quality Assurance is about the processes we have in place to deliver what is asked
    of us. Quality Assurance is not focusing on the deliverables themselves, but on
    how we plan to deliver them. **Quality Control** (**QC**) activities are focused
    on the deliverables and are concerned with the acceptance of those project deliverables.
    Now let''s assume that you are a customer project manager entrusted with the sign
    off of the Functional Requirements Document for your implementation. Before signing
    off, you could inspect each page of this document for the correctness, accuracy,
    and consistency with your future business processes and demands. This would be
    an example of Quality Control. You could also verify the process on how this document
    was created. By doing so, you will retrieve information about the workshops that
    were organized, the people who attended, how your key users validated this information,
    that it was double checked by a Fit Gap assessment, and so on. This is an example
    of Quality Assurance with focus on the process of document creation. The following

    pretty much brute force or pressure from the top to "adopt or else." But the larger
    the organizations, and the larger the scope and impact of the project, the more

    see the need to use it. As such, it is very important that users are closely involved
    during the implementation and any concerns are heard and considered. It is also
    not uncommon for companies to conduct change workshops to convey the importance
    of being open-minded about the upcoming change.

    My Cheese?* by *Spencer Johnson*. Written as a parable featuring two mice and
    two little people, the story provides an amusing view of how one of the characters
    is able to navigate through the maze and find the cheese, while the other struggles
    due to his reluctance to change. The story can be related to a corporate setting
    in that the *maze* is the organization the employee works in, while the *cheese*
    is the end goal that the organization is trying to achieve. The enlightening story
    has helped many employees deal with the inevitable change and has also been used
    as a guide for change workshops.
