                    <h1 class="header-title">AR for Retail with Vuforia</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, you will work with Vuforia, one of the most well-known AR SDKs that offers a wide variety of options (working with and without image targets, web and local recognition, and more), as well as examples that can be directly downloaded and tested. It has also the advantage of being integrated into the Unity editor, making it easier to develop with it.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This chapter's first main goal is to introduce you to the Vuforia SDK and how it works. Among its many features, you will learn how to use spatial recognition and augmentation to place 3D objects in the real world without the need for previously printed image targets. You will learn how to use Vuforia fusion with and without ARCore and you will acquire the skills to use Vuforia's elements in Unity. This chapter's second goal is to present you with an attractive use of AR in retail to show potential customers products such as furniture, paintings, decorations, and more in their own spaces. With these kinds of applications, they can decide on which elements they want to buy and how they will look in their own homes, making them more involved in the buying process.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using AR for retail</li>
<li>Exploring Vuforia</li>
<li>AR on the go – using Ground Plane</li>
<li>Creating an AR furniture viewer</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Using AR for retail</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Retail is one of the fields where AR offers a wider range of possibilities, from satisfying and engaging the consumer in order to reduce returned products, to linking products with social media or personalizing the shopping experience. Some examples of this are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying products before buying them. This is where users visualize clothes, shoes, glasses, or even makeup before actually buying the products.</li>
<li>Seeing how a product such as a piece of furniture, a piece of art, or even wall paint looks in their homes with AR.</li>
<li>At the store, seeing extra information about a product, such as comments and reviews, before buying it.</li>
<li>In a commercial center, receiving geopositioned information and discounts from the stores in it.</li>
<li>In supermarkets or big stores, orienting customers through sections to the product they want.</li>
</ul>
<p>This field also allows us to display AR on various hardware, including customers' mobile devices, tactile screens, and virtual fitting rooms. Therefore, in the past few years, AR solutions in retail have multiplied, especially since ARKit (from Apple) and ARCore (from Google) appeared on the market. These two pieces of software allow us to easily recognize the environment using the camera and sensors of the mobile devices and place virtual elements over flat surfaces such as the ground or tables.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will take advantage of Vuforia Fusion, Vuforia SDK's ground detection features, which can also be combined with ARCore, to place virtual objects in our surroundings without any kind of printed target, creating an AR furniture viewer that customers can use to see how the furniture fits in their homes.</p>
<p class="mce-root">For our project, we will be using the real catalog pages and 3D models from the company Euro Seating at <a href="https://www.euroseating.com/en/">https://www.euroseating.com/en/</a>, a seating manufacturer present in more than 100 countries all over the world. Using their high-quality 3D models and real catalog will help us visualize this project as a real-life AR application that can be used in any other marketing context. The models and images that are used in this chapter have been handed over by the company for their use in the context of this book.</p>
<p>We will start by exploring Vuforia and how to integrate it into our Unity project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Exploring Vuforia</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Initially developed by Qualcomm, and currently run by PTC, Vuforia is one of the oldest and most well-known AR SDKs. It's one of the most stable and best-performing pieces of software on the market and, along with ARKit and ARCore, one of the favorite choices for AR developers.</p>
<p>Vuforia offers a wide variety of features, including 2D images and 3D objects tracking, markerless AR where there is no need for a reference image to launch AR content (the one we will be using in this chapter) and barcode-like markers called Vumarks. It provides multiple examples and extra features, such as virtual buttons, runtime image target creation, and background video texture manipulation. </p>
<p>Like other AR software, Vuforia requires a license for it to be deployed on mobile devices. Vuforia offers a free development key generator, which will have to be switched to a deployment key when the app is in the production stage. You can consult its pricing options on their web page: <a href="https://developer.vuforia.com/pricing">https://developer.vuforia.com/pricing</a>.</p>
<p>The Vuforia SDK can be downloaded for Android and iOS, and can also be used in the Unity 3D platform. Since the Unity 2017.2 version, it comes directly integrated into the Unity editor, just like any other main asset, and it has to be installed and activated inside it. Now, we'll incorporate Vuforia into a new project and set it up so that we can build it on an Android device. Let's get started:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">
<p>When you first installed Unity on your computer (see <a href="54a1260e-a741-4eb5-9c98-01350fcba94b.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Introduction to Unity for AR Development</em>), you should have selected the option of adding the Vuforia module. If you didn't install it or you are in doubt, open the Unity Hub, go to the Installs tab, and check the installed modules at the bottom of your Unity version:</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Update message from Vuforia Engine</p>
<p>Now that we know how to integrate Vuforia into a new project, we will start using its Ground Plane feature to create an app that detects flat surfaces and places 3D content on them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">AR on the go – using Ground Plane</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">Vuforia's main feature that's used to place virtual objects on the user's environment in real time is called <strong>Ground Plane</strong><em>.</em> We are going to use this feature to create an app to place 3D content on horizontal surfaces of the real world, such as floors and tables. </p>
<p class="mce-root">Starting with Vuforia 7, the SDK introduced a new capability, called <strong>Vuforia Fusion</strong>, to improve the performance of spatial recognition according to each device's features, including cameras, sensors, chipsets, and internal AR frameworks. Vuforia Fusion tries to detect integrated frameworks such as ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android), which offer the best performance. If none are found, it tries to use VISLAM and SLAM, respectively.</p>
<div><strong>Simultaneous localization and mapping</strong> (<strong>SLAM</strong>) algorithms estimate the pose of an object and the map of the surrounding environment at the same time. <strong>visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping</strong> (<strong>VISLAM</strong>) is Vuforia's algorithm that combines <strong>v</strong><strong>isual odometry</strong> (<strong>VIO</strong>) and SLAM to improve the latter's performance.</div>
<p class="mce-root">Although the list increases quickly, not all devices support Vuforia's Ground Plane yet. In general, if the running device supports ARCore or ARKit, it will work. If not, it will depend on internal AR-enabling technologies. Vuforia keeps a list of the currently supported devices on its web page: <a href="https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Solution/vuforia-fusion-supported-devices.html">https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Solution/vuforia-fusion-supported-devices.html</a>.</p>
<p>In the next subsection, we are going to learn how to enable ARCore in Vuforia. If your device doesn't support ARCore, you can directly skip to the next subsection. If you are planning to distribute your app among ARCore-supporting and -non-supporting devices, and want to test Vuforia's VISLAM performance first, skip this step and do this after testing the final app to see the difference.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Enabling ARCore in Vuforia</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this section, we're going to learn to enable ARCore for Vuforia; if your device supports ARCore, you will benefit from using it along with Vuforia, as the resulting app will detect flat surfaces faster and with more precision. To enable ARCore for Vuforia inside Unity, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the latest version of the ARCore library from Google's repository. The global link is <kbd>https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/com/google/ar/core/&lt;ARCORE_VERSION&gt;/core-&lt;ARCORE_VERSION&gt;.aar</kbd>.<em><br/></em>You can check the latest version available at <a href="https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-sdk/releases">https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-sdk/releases</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time of writing this chapter, the current version is 1.9.0, so the link will be <a href="https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/com/google/ar/core/1.9.0/core-1.9.0.aar">https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/com/google/ar/core/1.9.0/core-1.9.0.aar</a>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In Unity, in the Project window, right-click on the <kbd>Assets</kbd> folder and press Create|Folder. Name it <kbd>Plugins</kbd> and create another one called <kbd>Android</kbd> inside it:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1161 image-border" src="img/7ad90606-9b4f-4b74-bb94-7e0d9b438e23.png" style="width:39.08em;height:19.50em;"/></p>

<p>Opening Vuforia Engine configuration from the ARCamera</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Under Device Tracker, set ARCore Requirement to Optional or Required, depending on your targeted user devices:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1816 image-border" src="img/76fcf545-0b82-4971-9b53-e7b8b1e89db2.png" style="width:18.33em;height:24.08em;"/></p>
<p>Setting ARCore to OPTIONAL or REQUIRED</p>
<p>If set to OPTIONAL, when using Ground Plane, Vuforia will try to make use of ARCore, and if the device doesn't support it, it will switch to Vuforia's internal algorithms. If set to REQUIRED, the app won't work on devices that don't support ARCore.</p>
<p>Now that we have configured ARCore, we'll create an AR scene to test the Ground Plane feature.</p>

<p class="mce-root">The AR scene in this project will consist of the following elements:</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li class="mce-root">The Ground Plane Stage, which is the parent GameObject where the virtual elements will go</li>
<li>A test cube, which will appear on the ground when the user taps on the screen</li>

<p>Now, we have included a Vuforia development key in our project that will let us build and install our app on a real device.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that when you want to upload an app to the store (Google or Apple), you will have to buy a deployment key according to Vuforia's plans. You can find the updated prices at <a href="https://developer.vuforia.com/pricing">https://developer.vuforia.com/pricing</a>. </p>
<p>In the next section, we will test our app in Unity to make sure everything works as it should.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Testing the app</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When developing a project in Unity, it's good practice to test it before building it since the building process takes time. This way, you can detect basic problems and errors and correct them quickly before actually trying the app on your phone.</p>
<p>Vuforia can't currently be built as a standalone application, but it has a script integrated with the ARCamera for testing purposes. When you are testing the app in Unity editor, it will use the computer's camera to simulate the AR. If it doesn't detect a camera, it will leave the background black and play the AR directly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when you're working with a Ground Plane project and you want to test the app, Vuforia won't be able to use the device's sensors to detect a flat surface. Instead, it offers an image target reference to simulate Ground Plane recognition, and when the camera detects that image, it will behave like it's detecting a flat surface on the phone.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>To test our app, follow these steps:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Locate the PDF called <kbd>Emulator Ground Plane.pdf</kbd> at Vuforia|Databases|ForPrint|Emulator from the Project window. Print it and place it on the ground (you can also open the PDF image directly on the computer, although the size reference might not be accurate).</li>
<li>Press the play button in the top Toolbar and point the webcam to the image. You will see a visual mark when the software detects a surface (the target, in this case). Before pressing the play button, you can click the Maximize on Play button in the Game view's top-right corner to see the image maximized on the screen:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1821 image-border" src="img/6e58c8cd-228b-460a-aeeb-07ada120aed8.png" style="width:114.75em;height:73.33em;"/></p>
<p>Game view detecting the Ground Plane Emulator image</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click on the computer screen over the Game view to simulate a screen touch on the phone. The cube will appear over the target. Its size will depend on the size that you gave previously in the Unity editor (the Ground Plane Stage in Unity is 100 cm x 100 cm, while the printed emulator is 20 cm x 20 cm): </li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1822 image-border" src="img/1276a128-54ff-4fd9-89d0-63d504191a76.png" style="width:115.08em;height:72.92em;"/></p>
<p>The cube appears on the floor when clicking the Game view</p>
<p>If everything works as expected, we can change the cube and start shaping our AR app to show furniture in the real world.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Now that we have the main structure of the AR scene, we'll customize the app to create an AR furniture viewer that allows us to place chairs in the real world. The app will let us do the following:</p>

<p>ChairHandler script in Visual Studio</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>At the beginning of the class, add the following variables:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">public GameObject rotateGO;<br/>private float rotateSpeed = 0.8f;</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The first variable refers to the Quad GameObject we created previously (with the rotation arrows image). The second variable controls the rotation speed of the chair.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Inside the <kbd>Start()</kbd> method, add the following code:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">rotateGO.SetActive(false);</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"> With this, we are hiding the rotate arrows until the chair is actually rotating. </p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Now, inside the <kbd>Update()</kbd> method, add the following code:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">Touch[] touches = Input.touches;<br/>if (Input.touchCount == 2 &amp;&amp; (touches[0].phase == TouchPhase.Moved || touches[1].phase == TouchPhase.Moved))<br/>{<br/> rotateGO.SetActive(true);<br/><br/> Vector2 previousPosition= touches[1].position - touches[1].deltaPosition - (touches[0].position - touches[0].deltaPosition);<br/> Vector2 currentPosition = touches[1].position - touches[0].position;<br/> float angleDelta = Vector2.Angle(previousPosition, currentPosition);<br/> Vector3 cross = Vector3.Cross(previousPosition, currentPosition);<br/><br/> Vector3 previousRotation = transform.localEulerAngles;<br/> if (cross.z &gt; 0)<br/> {<br/> transform.localEulerAngles = previousRotation - new Vector3(0, angleDelta * rotateSpeed, 0);<br/> }<br/> else if (cross.z &lt; 0)<br/> {<br/> transform.localEulerAngles = previousRotation + new Vector3(0, angleDelta * rotateSpeed, 0);<br/> } <br/>}<br/>else<br/>{<br/> rotateGO.SetActive(false);<br/>} </pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The preceding code retrieves the touches coming from the screen. If it's two touches (two fingers touching the screen) and at least one of them is moving, it does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">Makes the rotation image visible.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">Retrieves the touches' positions.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px">Calculates the angle between the last finger position and the current one, and rotates the chair accordingly. When the user stops rotating the chair, the rotation image is hidden again.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="12">
<li>The final step is to drag the Quad GameObject from the Hierarchy to the ChairHandler script's Rotate GO field in the Inspector window.</li>
<li>Now, you can directly press <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>B</em> to build and run the project or do so through File|Build And Run. As you can see, the mark on the ground is much more visible now:</li>
</ol>

<p>The new ground reference mark</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Now, you can also rotate the chair to see how it would look in its place:</li>

<p>Rotation arrows appearing when the user rotates the chair with two fingers</p>
<p>With that, we have completed the AR furniture viewer. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we have learned about one of Vuforia's features: Ground Plane. We created a project that places virtual chairs in real-life scenarios and lets us manipulate them with touchscreens (rotate them) and through a simple UI button (multiply them).</p>
<p class="mce-root">By now, you will have a better understanding of how Vuforia works, how to create Vuforia elements inside Unity, and how to create a wholly functional Ground Plane example in it. With the skills that you've acquired through this project's development, you can improve it by adding new 3D models, new UI elements, or updating the current scripts to include more features in the app.</p>
<p class="mce-root">You also have better insight into how AR can work in the retail field so that you can adapt the current project to fill your personal or professional needs in this area. As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter and seen throughout, the app can easily be changed to display other types of furniture, decorations, carpets, or any product that you want to show over a surface and observe from different angles.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In the next chapter, we will be exploring Vuforia's possibilities even further by looking at Image Targets and deploying the app inside Moverio AR glasses.</p>

<p>From here, you can try to use Vuforia's Mid Air option, which, instead of placing the objects attached to the ground, places them at a distance from it. This can be useful for placing objects on walls, such as frames, pictures, and so on, or when working with flying objects such as drones. Their use is very similar; instead of creating a Plane Finder and Ground Plane Stage, you create a Mid Air Positione<em>r</em> and Mid Air Stage.</p>
<p>You can also download the Vuforia core samples from the Unity Asset Store (<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/vuforia-core-samples-99026">https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/vuforia-core-samples-99026</a>), which includes a full example of the Ground Plane and its features.</p>
