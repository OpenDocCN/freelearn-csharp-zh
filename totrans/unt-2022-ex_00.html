<p class="calibre3">Hello! The Unity game engine presents an exciting opportunity for aspiring game developers to bring their creative visions to life. This book is designed for those committed to making finished games while following best practices and wanting to release games commercially. By the end of this comprehensive journey, you’ll have not only gained the knowledge and skills in Unity 2022 but also a sense of accomplishment, knowing that you’re one step closer to achieving your goal of creating and publishing games.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This book aims to guide you through structuring your game projects effectively, covering everything from code organization to asset management and scene hierarchy. I delve into fundamental game design principles, including crafting core gameplay loops, defining player actions, implementing mechanics, and establishing win/lose conditions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Throughout the chapters, we tackle vital challenges newer game developers may encounter, such as gaps in game design concepts, familiarity with Unity’s features and Scripting API, and proficiency in C# programming. Unity’s distinctive methodology for constructing game elements is central to our approach, emphasizing a component-based approach driven by C# scripts.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This book takes a practical approach to learning as I guide you through a series of projects. We’ll start with a simple 2D object collection game and gradually progress to immersive 3D <strong class="bold">first person shooter</strong> (<strong class="bold">FPS</strong>) and <strong class="bold">mixed reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">MR</strong>) experiences. Each chapter builds on the previous one, introducing new concepts and techniques and providing practical examples, hands-on exercises, and the occasional challenge or bonus activity. This way, you’ll not only understand the theory but also gain valuable practical skills.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Moreover, I address essential aspects often overlooked in traditional learning materials, such as publishing games for commercialization, project continuance and version control, and supporting games throughout their lifetime. You’ll also gain insights into <strong class="bold">Unity Gaming Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">UGS</strong>) and the process of operating a game as a service. This comprehensive approach ensures that you’ll be well-prepared for all stages of game development.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the end of this book, you’ll possess solid foundational knowledge of Unity 2022 and be equipped to structure projects in a maintainable and extensible way for commercially releasing games. So, let’s embark on this journey together and unleash your potential as a game developer in the vibrant ecosystem of Unity!</p>
