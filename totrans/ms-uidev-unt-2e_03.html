<h1 id="_idParaDest-26" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor025" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Designing Mobile User Interfaces</h1>
<p class="calibre3">One of the most challenging aspects of designing for mobile interfaces is the sheer amount of possible aspect ratios of mobile devices. Mobile devices include phones and tablets. Phones tend to be much longer than tablet devices, and a UI that fits perfectly on a phone may overlap or look squished when put on a tablet. On top of awkward resolutions, there are also weird quirks that will affect your UI, such as the notch in the iPhone and the folding screens of the various Samsung <span>Galaxy devices.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Mobile devices also have a different set of inputs and interactions. For example, on a mobile device, you can touch the screen at multiple locations simultaneously, but on a PC, you can only click with your mouse in one place at a time. Mobile devices require on-screen keyboards and other peripherals to perform the same actions that you might perform on a console or <span>PC game.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, I will discuss the design considerations around the various quirks of mobile devices and cover the <span>following topics:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14">How to simulate your game at various mobile resolutions and build at a <span>specific orientation</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">The recommended button sizes for <span>mobile games</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">Utilizing invisible buttons to create <span>tap areas</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">Laying out interactions based on the <span>thumb zone</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">How multi-touch input plays a part in <span>mobile UI</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">When to use the accelerometer <span>and gyroscope</span></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-27" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor026" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="calibre3">For this chapter, you will need Unity 2020.3.26f1 <span>or later.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">When describing mobile interfaces, I will mostly focus on iOS and Android operating system phones and tablets. However, occasionally I will reference Microsoft, as they do create a series of tablet devices that, despite running Windows operating systems, do have <span>touch capabilities.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-28" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor027" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Setting the resolution, aspect ratio, and orientation</h1>
<p class="calibre3">When you design a mobile UI, you’ll want to make sure it makes sense and is visible at various resolution <a id="_idIndexMarker034" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>sizes and aspect ratios. You also may want to <a id="_idIndexMarker035" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>allow for different screen orientations. In <a href="B18327_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, I will discuss <a id="_idIndexMarker036" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>how you can develop user interfaces that scale to multiple resolutions and layouts, mechanically. But for now, let’s just review how resolution, aspect ratio, and orientation can affect your design and how to view your game with the various <span>screen settings.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-29" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor028" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Setting the resolution in the Game view</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Recall in <a href="B18327_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, we looked <a id="_idIndexMarker037" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>at how you can <a id="_idIndexMarker038" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>change the resolution and aspect ratio of your <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view. When you change your game’s build settings to iOS or Android, a new list of presets will be provided to you. For example, in the following image, you can see the list of possibilities when the <strong class="bold">Build</strong> is set <span>to iOS:</span></p>
<div class="calibre2">

<p class="calibre3">It will not <a id="_idIndexMarker039" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>show all the possible iOS resolutions, but many <a id="_idIndexMarker040" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>of the common newer ones. You can find a more complete list at <a href="https://www.ios-resolution.com/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://www.ios-resolution.com/</a>. Similarly, not all Android resolutions will be listed when switching to an Android build, especially considering there are significantly more Android resolutions. However, you can find <a id="_idIndexMarker041" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>more information about Android screen resolutions <span>at </span><a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.xhtml#testing" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span>https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.xhtml#testing</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-30" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor029" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The Device Simulator</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Sometimes, setting the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view’s aspect isn’t sufficient to fully see how your UI will appear on <a id="_idIndexMarker042" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>a device. For example, the controversial notch introduced in the iPhone X doesn’t display in the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> view and can throw a huge wrench in <a id="_idIndexMarker043" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>your most carefully designed UIs. However, you can see this notch and how it overlaps with your UI using the <span><strong class="bold">Device Simulator</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">To enable the Device Simulator, complete the <span>following steps:</span></p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre14">Download the Device Simulator Package from <span><strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong></span><span>.</span><p class="calibre3">To do so, go to <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong> and search for <strong class="bold">Device Simulator</strong> in the list.

<h2 id="_idParaDest-31" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor030" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Building for a specific orientation</h2>
<p class="calibre3">You may have noticed in <span><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> that there are both landscape and portrait options for each <a id="_idIndexMarker048" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>resolution. This allows you to view your game depending on which orientation you want to support <span>while developing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">When building for mobile devices, you can’t specify resolution and aspect ratio and will instead have to support all resolutions and aspect ratios. However, you can choose between screen orientations on mobile devices. There are two different orientations: <strong class="bold">Landscape</strong> <span>and </span><span><strong class="bold">Portrait</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Games built so that they are wider than they are tall are said to have landscape resolution. Games built taller than they are wide are said to have portrait resolution. For example, a <strong class="bold">16:9</strong> aspect ratio would be a landscape resolution, and a <strong class="bold">9:16</strong> aspect ratio would be a portrait resolution, <span>as illustrated:</span></p>
<div class="calibre2">
<div class="img---figure" id="_idContainer029">
<img alt="Figure 2.8: Landscape versus portrait Orientation" src="image/Figure_2.8_B18327.jpg" class="calibre38"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.8: Landscape versus portrait Orientation</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, while you can’t choose the exact aspect ratio your mobile game will build to, you can choose the orientation, which forces the aspect ratio to be either wider or taller. You can set the orientation by navigating to <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> | <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Player Settings</strong> and selecting the mobile device. If you are building for both iOS and Android, you will not <a id="_idIndexMarker049" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>have to set these properties for both. As you can see from the following screenshot, the asterisk next to the property of <strong class="bold">Default Orientation</strong> states that the settings are shared between <span>multiple platforms:</span></p>

</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.9: Resolution and Orientation Settings for mobile</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can set the <strong class="bold">Default Orientation</strong> to either <strong class="bold">Auto Rotation</strong> or one of the other rotations, <span>as shown:</span></p>
<div class="calibre2">

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.11: Mobile orientation rotations</p>
<p class="calibre3">When you <a id="_idIndexMarker050" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>select a rotation other than <strong class="bold">Auto Rotation</strong> as the <strong class="bold">Default Orientation</strong>, the game will only play at that orientation on the device.

<p class="calibre3">In most cases, it is best to choose only the <strong class="bold">Landscape</strong> orientations or only the <strong class="bold">Portrait</strong> orientations, but not all four. Generally, allowing all four orientations will cause issues with the game›s UI’s ability to <span>scale appropriately.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Players tend to prefer to be able to rotate their games (especially if they’re like me and like to play <a id="_idIndexMarker051" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>games in bed while their phone is charging, thus being forced to face a specific direction), so unless you have a good reason to stop rotation, it’s a good idea to enable both <strong class="bold">Portrait</strong> and <strong class="bold">Portrait Upside Down</strong> or <strong class="bold">Landscape Right</strong> and <span><strong class="bold">Landscape Left</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-32" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor031" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Recommended button sizes</h1>
<p class="calibre3">When creating a mobile game, pretty much all of your interactions are controlled by button and screen taps. Buttons that are a reasonable size on a PC or console game may be too small <a id="_idIndexMarker052" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>for a mobile game. Therefore, you’ll want to make sure to design your buttons so that they are still visible on the smaller screen and large enough to be touched by <span>a finger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Apple, Google, and Microsoft all have specific recommendations for the size of a button’s <em class="italic">touchable area</em> when designing for their devices. Apple recommends that buttons be 44 points x 44 points. Google recommends 48 dp x 48 dp with 8 dp spacing between two buttons. Microsoft recommends 9 mm x 9 mm with 2 mm padding between <span>two buttons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">You can find information about designing touch/hit areas for each mobile platform at the <span>following locations:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14"><span>Apple: </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span>https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout</span></a></li>
<li class="calibre14"><span>Google: </span><a href="https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.xhtml#layout-and-typography" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span>https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.xhtml#layout-and-typography</span></a></li>
<li class="calibre14"><span>Microsoft: </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/input/guidelines-for-targeting" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/input/guidelines-for-targeting</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Annoyingly, all of these recommendations are in different units of measurement. So, what do these numbers even mean in terms of design? How do you make sure your buttons are 9 mm x 9 mm or 44 points x 44 points? And why are they talking about these measurements in different units? It’s almost like they are all competitors and don’t want to work nicely together! To answer these questions, let’s first look at what the various units of <span>measurement represent:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14">A <strong class="bold">point</strong> (<strong class="bold">pt</strong>) is used to measure what represents a physical measurement on a screen. 1 point is 1/72 of an international inch or 0.3528 mm. It is primarily used in typography and print media. When working with a program such as <strong class="bold">Illustrator</strong>, creating an object in points and then exporting your image at 72 ppi makes pixels and points the same size. Points and pixels are not the same, except when exporting at <span>72 ppi.</span></li>
<li class="calibre14"><strong class="bold">Density-independent pixels</strong> (<strong class="bold">dp</strong>), pronounced “dips”, is a unit of measurement that was created to maintain consistently sized items on screens with different <strong class="bold">dpi</strong> (<strong class="bold">dots per inch</strong>) values. A density-independent pixel measures the size of 1 pixel on a 160 dpi screen. Using this conversion is like saying it <a id="_idIndexMarker053" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>would appear at this size on a 160 dpi screen, and it should appear as the exact same physical size on any other screen. You can read more about density-independent pixels <span>at</span><span> </span><a href="https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span>https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">When <strong class="bold">millimeters</strong> (<strong class="bold">mm</strong>) are used to describe a button size, the size is a physical representation of the button on the screen. So, if you were to take a ruler and hold it up to the screen, it would be consistent with this unit <span>of measurement.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">OK, so they all represent some physical unit of measurement on the screen. That makes things a little easier. Let’s convert all of these values to millimeters so we can compare them in a unit of measurement that is a bit easier to conceptualize. I’m also going to convert them to points, since you can use points in a program, such as Illustrator, to create your <span>button art.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">If you need to convert any of these units of measurement and you’re not too keen on the idea of doing math, googling <em class="italic">convert points to mm</em> will bring up a nice conversion calculator <span>for you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">You can also use the following converter tool – it is really handy for bouncing between all of the different units of <span>measurement: </span><a href="http://angrytools.com/android/pixelcalc/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span>http://angrytools.com/android/pixelcalc/</span></a></p>
<p class="calibre3">In the following chart, I rounded to the nearest integer the measurement for points, and to the nearest tenth for millimeters, to make things easier. We can use this image as a way to compare the different sizes (the image has been scaled and the sizes may not translate to their <span>real-world measurements):</span></p>
<div class="calibre2">
<div class="img---figure" id="_idContainer034">
<img alt="Figure 2.13: Recommended minimum tappable button sizes" src="image/Figure_2.13_B18327.jpg" class="calibre43"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.13: Recommended minimum tappable button sizes</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, which size should you use? It’s up to you. You don’t have to use their recommendations, but I personally go with the Apple recommendation since it is the largest and <a id="_idIndexMarker054" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>therefore meets the recommendations of the other two. Additionally, the larger the button is, the more people will be able to easily touch it. In <a href="B18327_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, we will discuss designing our UI so that the maximum amount of people will be able to interact <span>with it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Another consideration is whether your game will be played with thumbs or with fingers. If the game will be played with thumbs, you’ll want bigger buttons because thumbs are bigger! The numbers described previously are minimum recommendations, so they would be used for a finger tap, not a <span>thumb tap.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">So, how do you ensure that your buttons are always the size you want in your game? The <strong class="bold">Canvas Scaler</strong> component! In <a href="B18327_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, we will discuss how ensuring a button of a specified size, regardless of resolution, can be achieved by setting the <strong class="bold">Canvas Scaler</strong> component’s <strong class="bold">UI Scale Mode</strong> to <strong class="bold">Constant Physical Size</strong>. You have the option to have your Canvas’s measurement units be in millimeters or points (as well as a few <span>other units).</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">My recommendation when designing for mobile devices is to have multiple devices on hand to test at various resolutions. Play the game and see how it feels to you. Ask people with <a id="_idIndexMarker055" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>smaller and larger hands than yours to play. Even after following the minimum guidelines specified by the various mobile platforms, you may still find your buttons are too small for what <span>you need.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Google and Microsoft also specify visible sizes that they recommend, so you can have a smaller button image as long as the button’s hit area is the recommended size. If you want a button that is smaller visually but has a larger hit area, instead of attaching the button component to the tiny piece of art, attach it to a larger parent hit area and change the target image of the button to the <span>t<a id="_idTextAnchor032" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>iny art.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-33" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor033" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Full screen/screen portion taps</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Many mobile games have a single input whereby you can tap anywhere on the screen to make an action happen. For example, endless runners tend to allow the player to tap or press and hold <a id="_idIndexMarker056" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>anywhere on the screen to jump. To achieve this, you only <a id="_idIndexMarker057" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>have to add an invisible button that covers the whole screen. If you have another UI that receives inputs, it needs to be in front of the full-screen button so that the button does not block the inputs to the other <span>UI items.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Some games require that you tap on specific regions of the screen to perform specific actions. For example, I created <a id="_idIndexMarker058" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>a game called Sequence Seekers for my doctoral dissertation. This game included a down-the-mountain mode in which the player had to tap the left or right-hand side of the screen to move left or right in the game. I achieved this by adding invisible buttons that covered the two halves of the screen, as <span>shown here:</span></p>

<p class="calibre3">In <a href="B18327_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor213" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a> and <a href="B18327_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor292" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, we’ll discuss <a id="_idIndexMarker059" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>how to implement such buttons <a id="_idIndexMarker060" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>as well as how to implement floating D-Pads <span>an<a id="_idTextAnchor034" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>d joysticks.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-34" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor035" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>The thumb zone</h1>
<p class="calibre3">When designing a mobile game, it’s important to consider how the player will hold the device. You don’t <a id="_idIndexMarker061" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>want to put your UI in areas that will be difficult for the player to reach. Players tend to prefer to hold and play with one hand. Not all games allow for this, but if possible, you want to allow your players to do so. How do you know whether your UI is in an area that’s reachable by the thumb? Put the UI in the thumb zone! Essentially, the thumb zone is the area of the phone that is comfortable for the player to reach when holding the phone with one hand. You can find the thumb zone on your particular phone by holding the phone and easily moving your thumb around without having to move <span>your hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The following blog post offers a really great explanation of the thumb zone, along with a handy (no pun intended) template for finding the thumb zone on various <span>devices: </span><a href="https://www.scotthurff.com/posts/how-to-design-for-thumbs-in-the-era-of-huge-screens/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span>https://www.scotthurff.com/posts/how-to-design-for-thumbs-in-the-era-of-huge-screens/</span></a></p>
<p class="calibre3">The phones <a id="_idIndexMarker062" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>referenced in the link are a bit on the old side, but it is still one of the best resources related to the thumb zone available on <span>the internet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">As a lefty, I implore you to consider making the game as easy to play with the left hand as it is for the right when designing with the thumb<a id="_idTextAnchor036" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/> zone <span>in mind.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3">When designing for mobile, it’s important to remember that the input works a little differently than it does with a computer or console game. Most of the input on a mobile is controlled <a id="_idIndexMarker063" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>by the touchscreen, accelerometer, or gyroscope. This opens up a different set of design choices for you when creating <span>mobile games.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Touchscreen devices can generally access multiple touches. You can use multi-touch for different types of interactions, but the most common usage of multi-touch allows the player to pinch-to-zoom. In <a href="B18327_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor147" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, we will discuss how to use multi-touch input to create pan and pinch-to-zoom functionality in <span>a game.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Most mobile devices have a built-in accelerometer and many also have a gyroscope. Without getting too technical in describing how they actually work, the difference between the accelerometer and the gyroscope is what they measure. The accelerometer measures acceleration within the 3D coordinate system and the gyroscope measures rotation. We will review examples of how to use the accelerometer and gyroscop<a id="_idTextAnchor038" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>e in <a href="B18327_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor147" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-36" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor039" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Device-specific resources</h1>
<p class="calibre3">If you are <a id="_idIndexMarker064" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>making a UI for a mobile device, you may want to use the device-specific UI elements to maintain a consistent style. You can find various art assets and templates for designing UI for each mobile platform at the <span>following </span><span><a id="_idIndexMarker065" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/></span><span>locations:</span></p>

<p class="calibre3">Creating a UI for mobile devices isn’t too different from creating a UI for a console or computer, but it is different in that you can accept more than one screen input and can also access information about the device’s accelerometer and gyroscope. Additionally, resolution plays an important part in your game’s development, since mobile devices have a huge range of resolutions and <span>aspect ratios.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next chapter, we’ll discuss the design considerations for developing UI for XR applications, including VR, MR, <span>and AR.</span></p>
