- en: It all started about a year ago and BizTalk Services was soon to go for preview
    in a few months. We were all excited to break new ground in the era of cloud middleware.
    We must tell you one of the benefits of being in the product group (or being an
    MVP) is that you get early access to bits long before they hit the market. Working
    on those bits, we thought to ourselves, "Wouldn't it be nice for our customers
    to have a guide to build effective solutions with this service?" This book on
    BizTalk Services was envisioned not necessarily to spoil the fun by adding every
    little detail, but to cover enough to understand the architecture, the key components,
    and help you explore.

- en: This book is written for beginners, and knowledge of BizTalk Server is neither
    assumed nor expected. It is also the first book on the topic, and we'll cover
    all the important features including EAI, B2B, and hybrid deployments in detail—all
    with code samples and walkthroughs. If you are an EAI user, you can start with
    [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Hello BizTalk Services"), *Hello BizTalk Services*
    and then continue with [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Messages and Transforms"),
    *Messages and Transforms*, [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Bridges"), *Bridges*,
    and [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Enterprise Application Integration"), *Enterprise
    Application Integration*. On the other hand, a B2B developer or architect can
    follow [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Hello BizTalk Services"), *Hello BizTalk
    Services*, [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Messages and Transforms"), *Messages
    and Transforms*, and [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Business-to-business Integration"),
    *Business-to-business Integration*. If you're interested in the APIs underpinning
    the services, troubleshooting your solutions, or how to move to BizTalk Services,
    then [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. API"), *API*, [Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Tracking
    and Troubleshooting"), *Tracking and Troubleshooting*, and [Chapter 8](ch08.html
    "Chapter 8. Moving to BizTalk Services"), *Moving to BizTalk Services* will guide
    you.
