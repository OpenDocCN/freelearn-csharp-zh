			<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Chapter 7</em>: Creating a Game Loop and Mock Test</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we moved from the <strong class="source-inline">testLevel</strong> scene (where we controlled the player ship) to a <strong class="source-inline">shop</strong> scene (buying and calibrating the player's ship). In this chapter, we will be following a similar trend of stretching out to the rest of the other game scenes in our <strong class="source-inline">Scene</strong> folder (found in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window in the <strong class="source-inline">Assets</strong> folder).</p>
			<p>As part of scene management, all games we play have something called a "Game Loop" – if you're not familiar with the term, it basically means our game will have alternative routes to take. Each route will load a particular scene. We will need to cater for either outcome at each stage of the game.</p>
			<p>Eventually, all game loops will loop back to somewhere near the beginning. The following image shows what our game loop will look like by the end of this chapter:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer214" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1 – Killer Wave's Game Loop</p>
			<p>Referring to the game loop image still, each name in its rectangular box represents a scene in Unity that we have in our <strong class="source-inline">Scene</strong> folder inside the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window. The flow of each scene goes in one overall direction, starting at the top with <strong class="bold">BOOTUP</strong>. This is when the game is launched for the first time. The flow will fall through each scene until the player beats all three levels or dies. Either way, they will eventually reach the <strong class="bold">GAMEOVER</strong> scene, which will then loop back up to the <strong class="bold">TITLE</strong> scene to create a loop.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, we will be in the position to run our game from the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene, where it will automatically move onto the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> scene. From there, the player will press the fire button or tap the screen to then load up the <strong class="source-inline">shop</strong> scene, which is where purchases can be made.</p>
			<p>Once the player presses the <strong class="bold">START</strong> button in the <strong class="source-inline">shop</strong> scene, the first level (<strong class="source-inline">level1</strong>) will start. If the player dies, the level will restart, whereas if the player completes the level, they will move onto the next level.</p>
			<p>The final outcome from all of this will be that if the player dies three times, they will be taken back to the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> scene, whereas if the player completes the <strong class="source-inline">level3</strong> scene, then the game will be over, and the player will be taken to the <strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong> scene.</p>
			<p>Finally, we will cover a few mock test questions related to what we have covered so far.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Transitioning our player ship</h1>
			<p>Currently, our <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>levels can only be completed when the player dies, causing the level to restart, or when the player loses all three lives. Only then are we taken to the game over screen. We now need to start thinking of how a player starts and ends a level. Currently, the player just appears at the start of a level.</p>
			<p>In this section, we are going to write some code that animates our player into the scene and, when the level completes, we will have the player ship exit the camera view.</p>
			<p>So, let's make a script the same way we did all the other scripts (<a href="B18381_02_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Adding and Manipulating Objects</em>, if you need a reference). Name the script <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> and make sure we have the file in our <strong class="source-inline">Script</strong> folder in the Unity Editor <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window.</p>
			<p>We now need to attach the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script to our <strong class="source-inline">player_ship</strong> prefab:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Load up the <strong class="source-inline">testLevel</strong> scene from <strong class="source-inline">Assets/Scene</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window.</li>
				<li>Then, navigate to the <strong class="source-inline">Assets/Prefab/Player</strong> folder, and select the <strong class="source-inline">player_ship</strong> prefab.</li>
				<li>Finally, drag and drop the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script into an empty area of the <strong class="source-inline">player_ship</strong> <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window. Then make sure the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> component in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window is turned off by unticking its box. If this box is left ticked, the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> component will start animating <strong class="source-inline">player_ship</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">shop</strong> scene.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that our script has been created and attached, we can go into it and start setting up the following code:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adding variables to our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script</li>
				<li>Adding methods/functions to our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script</li>
				<li>Adding <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement checks</li>
				<li>Adding <a id="_idIndexMarker638"/>content to <strong class="source-inline">PlayerMovement IEnumerator</strong></li>
				<li>Moving the player ship out of the screen</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's take a look.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Adding variables to our PlayerTransition script</h2>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>section, we are going to make a start by <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>setting up our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script. We'll do this by adding global variables so that these can be used to position the player ship.</p>
			<p>To start adding our global variables, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open our newly created <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script.</li>
				<li>At the top of the script, make sure we have the following libraries added:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">using UnityEngine;using System.Collections;</strong></p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>By default, our script should be automatically named along with its default inherit <strong class="source-inline">MonoBehaviour</strong> as it's a requirement regarding the Unity Editor and other functionalities. The <strong class="source-inline">System.Collections</strong> library will be used for our <strong class="source-inline">StartCoroutine</strong>. Without this library, we can't create coroutines; we will explain more about this when we come to coding it in.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Check/enter the following code for our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script, which holds <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>the<a id="_idIndexMarker642"/> script's default name and <strong class="source-inline">MonoBeaviour</strong> inheritance for added functionality:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">public class PlayerTransition : MonoBehaviour </strong> <strong class="bold">{</strong></p></li>
				<li>Within the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> class, enter the following global <strong class="source-inline">Vector3</strong> variables:<p class="source-code">    Vector3 transitionToEnd = new Vector3(-100,0,0);    Vector3 transitionToCompleteGame = new Vector3(7000,0,0);    Vector3 readyPos = new Vector3(900,0,0);    Vector3 startPos;</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">startPos</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">readyPos</strong> variables are used to measure the distance from where our player ship is and where we want it to travel to.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">At this point, be sure that the <strong class="source-inline">_Player</strong> game object's <strong class="bold">Transform Position</strong> property values are set to zero on its X, Y, and Z axes in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window. Otherwise, the player ship may animate into the wrong position when entering the level.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">transitionToEnd</strong> variables will be used as the coordinates where we want our player game object ship to travel to at the start of the level, as well as when the player's ship is about to leave a level. <strong class="source-inline">transitionToCompleteGame</strong> is only used when the player completes the third and final level and is used to alter the player's ending animation.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Continue entering the following <strong class="source-inline">float</strong> variables in our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script:<p class="source-code">  float distCovered;  float journeyLength;</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">distCovered</strong> will hold time data that will be used later to measure between two <strong class="source-inline">Vector3</strong> points (we will talk about this in more detail when we make <strong class="source-inline">PlayerMovement</strong> <strong class="source-inline">IEnumerator</strong>).</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">journeyLength</strong> will <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>hold the distance between the two <strong class="source-inline">Vector3</strong> points mentioned <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>previously (<strong class="source-inline">startPos</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">readyPos</strong>).</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">The final set of variables are the bools to be added to our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script:<p class="source-code"> bool levelStarted = true; bool speedOff = false; bool levelEnds = false; bool gameCompleted = false; public bool LevelEnds  {    get {return levelEnds;}    set {levelEnds = value;} } public bool GameCompleted  {    get {return gameCompleted;}    set {gameCompleted = value;} }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">levelStarted</strong> is the only <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> set to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> as it confirms that the level has started and will only be set to <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> after the transition of the player's animation has finished. <strong class="source-inline">speedOff</strong> will be set to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> when we want the player's ship to leave the level.</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">levelEnds</strong> is set to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> when the level has come to the end and the player ship will then move to its exit position. The last <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> is for when the whole game has been completed. This is used to change the ending animation. The two <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>properties are used for <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>accessing the <strong class="source-inline">levelEnds</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">gameCompleted</strong> variables from outside of the script.</p>
			<p>That's our variables added to our script. Now, let's continue to the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> methods and functions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Adding methods/functions to our PlayerTransition script</h2>
			<p>As we <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>continue <a id="_idIndexMarker648"/>through our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script, we will add Unity's <strong class="source-inline">Start</strong> function and create our own <strong class="source-inline">Distance</strong> method to position the player's ship in the correct location:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Starting with the <strong class="source-inline">Start</strong> function, continue entering the following code for our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script:<p class="source-code">    void Start()    {        this.transform.localPosition = Vector3.zero;        startPos = transform.position;        Distance();    }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">Start</strong> function gets called as soon as this script is enabled. In this function, we will reset the position of the player's ship to its parent game object, which is the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerSpawner</strong> game object.</p>
			<p>We will then assign the player ship's beginning world space position to one of the vectors we created earlier in this section (<strong class="source-inline">startPos</strong>). We will use this in the <strong class="source-inline">Distance</strong> method, which we will talk about next.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Enter the <strong class="source-inline">Distance</strong> method and its content in the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> class: <p class="source-code">    void Distance()    {        journeyLength = Vector3.Distance(startPos, readyPos);    }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Vector3.Distance</strong> is a ready-made Unity function that will measure the distance between two vector points and gives the answer in the form of a <strong class="source-inline">float</strong> that <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>we will be storing in <strong class="source-inline">journeyLength</strong>. The reason for this is that we<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> will want to know the length between where our player ship is and where it needs to go (which we'll cover later in this chapter).</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will move into Unity's <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function, where we will check for when the level has ended so that we can exit (move) our player ship out of the screen.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Adding if statement checks</h2>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker652"/>are going to make use of Unity's frame update function, <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong>, so that we can run checks to see what state our game is at within the level.</p>
			<p>Within our <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function, we will have three <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements. <strong class="source-inline">levelStarted</strong> is from one of the <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> variables that we introduced earlier on in this section, which is already set to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>. So, this <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement is going to be called instantly. Let's take a look:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Let's start by entering the first <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement in the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script's <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function:<p class="source-code">    void Update()    {        if (levelStarted)        {            PlayerMovement(transitionToEnd, 10);         }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Within <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>the first <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement is a method called <strong class="source-inline">PlayerMovement</strong>, which also takes two parameters. With regards to what this method does, we will review its content after we have covered the entirety of the <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function.</p>
			<p>Now, let's continue with the second <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement in the <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function.</p>
			<p>This <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement checks to see if the <strong class="source-inline">levelEnds</strong> variable is <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, which, as you may recall, we set to <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> by default. This <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> is accessed outside of the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> class, which we will cover later, but for now, all we need to know is that it becomes <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> at the end of a level.</p>
			<p>Inside the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement, there are several lines that prepare our player's ship to begin the end of the level, starting with disabling the <strong class="source-inline">Player</strong> script by setting its <strong class="source-inline">enabled</strong> bool setting to <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>. This will knock out the player's controls so that we can animate the player ship into position for the end of the level.</p>
			<p>Next, we disable the player ship's <strong class="source-inline">SphereCollider</strong> so that if an enemy or one of its bullets comes into contact with the player's ship, it won't destroy the ship while it's preparing to end the level.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Enter the second following <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement inside the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function:<p class="source-code">if (levelEnds)  {    GetComponent&lt;Player&gt;().enabled = false;    GetComponent&lt;SphereCollider&gt;().enabled = false;    Distance();    PlayerMovement(transitionToEnd, 200);  }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Then, we <a id="_idIndexMarker654"/>measure the distance between where the player's ship was at the start of <a id="_idIndexMarker655"/>the level and where it needs to go with the <strong class="source-inline">Distance</strong> method.</p>
			<p>Finally, within the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement, we have the same method that we mentioned earlier, with the only difference being that the argument value is set to <strong class="source-inline">200</strong>. These values will be explained after the fourth <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement for this <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function.</p>
			<p>While we're still within the <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function, we can enter the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement that covers when the player completes the third and final level:</p>
			<p class="source-code">  if (gameCompleted)    {      GetComponent&lt;Player&gt;().enabled = false;      GetComponent&lt;SphereCollider&gt;().enabled = false;      PlayerMovement(transitionToCompleteGame, 200);    }</p>
			<p>If the <strong class="source-inline">gameCompleted</strong> <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, we fall into the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements condition. Inside, we turn off the <strong class="source-inline">Player</strong> script to disable the player's controls. The second line disables the player's collider to avoid any collisions with any enemy-related game objects, while the third line makes the player ship translate from its current position to the value of <strong class="source-inline">transitionToCompleteGame</strong>. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Enter the fourth <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement in our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function:<p class="source-code"> if (speedOff)    {       Invoke("SpeedOff",1f);    }}</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker656"/>fourth <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement, we run a check to <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>see if the <strong class="source-inline">speedOff</strong> <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> holds the value of <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>. If it does, we run Unity's own <strong class="source-inline">Invoke</strong> function, which delays the execution of the <strong class="source-inline">SpeedOff</strong> method with a 1-second delay.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Further Information</p>
			<p class="callout">More about <strong class="source-inline">Invoke</strong> can be found on the Unity Scripting reference site: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Invoke.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Invoke.html</a>.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will write some code so that the player is moved from where they are to where they need to be. The two cases where this will need to be achieved are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When the player starts the game, we animate them into the scene.</li>
				<li>When the player has completed the level, they need to move into a position to leave the level. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>be <a id="_idIndexMarker659"/>covering two new Unity functions (<strong class="source-inline">Mathf.Round</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Vector3.Lerp</strong>).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Adding content to the PlayerMovement method</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">PlayerMovement</strong> method holds <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>the<a id="_idIndexMarker661"/> responsibility of animating our player ship in the near center of the screen so that it can begin and also exit the level.</p>
			<p>Let's go into more detail to fully understand this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Enter the following code for our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerMovement</strong> method, along with its two parameters:<p class="source-code"> void PlayerMovement(Vector3 point, float transitionSpeed)    { </p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As mentioned previously, our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerMovement</strong> takes two parameters: a <strong class="source-inline">Vector3</strong> with the reference name <strong class="source-inline">point</strong> and a <strong class="source-inline">float</strong> with the reference name <strong class="source-inline">transitionSpeed</strong>. As you can imagine, <strong class="source-inline">transitionSpeed</strong> is the speed of the player ship moving from one point to another. </p>
			<p>If we trace back to what the value of <strong class="source-inline">point</strong> is, it's coming from a variable that we've already initialized, <strong class="source-inline">transitionToStart</strong>, with a <strong class="source-inline">Vector3</strong> at the beginning of this script with a value of <strong class="source-inline">(-100,0,0)</strong>.</p>
			<p>So, effectively, <strong class="source-inline">transitionToStart</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">point</strong> are the same – they're just different in terms of their names, for the sake of keeping their references separate. Anyway, coming back to <strong class="source-inline">point</strong>, this value is for our player's ship position. The following screenshot shows our player ship with <strong class="bold">Transform Position</strong> set to <strong class="source-inline">-100,0,0</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer215" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.02_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2 – Player Ship's position&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.2 – Player Ship's position</p>
			<p>So, when a level begins, our player ship will be on the far left, outside of the screen, and animate into the position we have marked in the previous screenshot.</p>
			<p>Carrying on with the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerMovement</strong> method, we begin with an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement that checks when a series of conditions are met. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Enter <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>the following <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement, along<a id="_idIndexMarker663"/> with its four conditions:<p class="source-code">   if (Mathf.Round(transform.localPosition.x) &gt;= readyPos.x -5 &amp;&amp;               Mathf.Round(transform.localPosition.x) &lt;= readyPos.x +5 &amp;&amp;               Mathf.Round(transform.localPosition.y) &gt;= -5f &amp;&amp;                         Mathf.Round(transform.localPosition.y) &lt;= +5f)                        {</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the previous code, we've run a check on four occasions to see if the player is in the correct position before executing the rest of the code. Each line of code checks the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the player ship's X position is more than or equal to the value that is stored in <strong class="source-inline">readyPos</strong> variable's X position, minus 5.</li>
				<li>If the player ship's X position is less than or equal to the value that is stored in <strong class="source-inline">readyPos</strong> variable's X position, plus 5.</li>
				<li>If the player ship's Y position is more than or equal to the value that is stored in <strong class="source-inline">readyPos</strong> variable's Y position, minus 5.</li>
				<li>If the player ship's Y position is less than or equal to the value that is stored in <strong class="source-inline">readyPos</strong> variable's Y position, plus 5.</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Still<a id="_idIndexMarker664"/> within our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerMovement</strong> method and within the previous <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement, enter <a id="_idIndexMarker665"/>the following two <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements:<p class="source-code">   if (levelEnds)    {      levelEnds = false;      speedOff = true;    }   if (levelStarted)     {       levelStarted = false;       distCovered = 0;       GetComponent&lt;Player&gt;().enabled = true;      }   }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>the previous code block, we have two <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements (<strong class="source-inline">levelEnds</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">levelStarted</strong>) that check that each of the <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>conditions are <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>. Let's go through both of their content:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">levelEnds</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> <strong class="source-inline">levelEnds</strong> becomes <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, we apply <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">levelEnds</strong> <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> and apply <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">speedOff</strong> <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">levelStarted</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> <strong class="source-inline">levelStarted</strong> is given the value <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, we apply false to the <strong class="source-inline">levelStarted</strong> <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong>, set the <strong class="source-inline">distCovered</strong> <strong class="source-inline">float</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, and we set the <strong class="source-inline">Player</strong> script to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Lastly, in our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerMovement</strong> method, enter the following <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> condition that sits outside the main <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement:<p class="source-code">   else      {       distCovered += Time.deltaTime * transitionSpeed;       float fractionOfJourney = distCovered /     journeyLength;       transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(transform.    position, point,         fractionOfJourney);      }   }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Referring to the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> condition code block, we add time and multiply it by <strong class="source-inline">transitionSpeed</strong>, which, as you may recall, is one of the two arguments this method takes. Make sure this else statement is relating to the Mathf.Round if statement and not the two bool checking if statements.</p>
			<p>We then divide the <strong class="source-inline">distCovered</strong> variable by the <strong class="source-inline">journeyLength</strong> variable, which, as you may recall, is a measurement between two points. We store the division in a <strong class="source-inline">float</strong> variable called <strong class="source-inline">fractionOfJourney</strong>. </p>
			<p>The last thing we do in this <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> condition is use one of Unity's pre-made functions called <strong class="source-inline">Lerp</strong>, which linearly interpolates our player's ship between two points. <strong class="source-inline">Lerp</strong> takes three arguments: point A, point B, and the time scale it's going to move between these two points. <strong class="source-inline">transform.position</strong> is our player's ship, the second is the <strong class="source-inline">Vector3</strong> point, which <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>is the other variable we brought into <strong class="source-inline">IEnumerator</strong>, and the third <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>is the active <strong class="source-inline">float</strong> <strong class="source-inline">fractionOfJourney</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Information</p>
			<p class="callout">It's also possible to <strong class="source-inline">Lerp</strong> colors over time with <strong class="source-inline">Material.Lerp</strong>.For more information about changing one color into another, check out <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.Lerp.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.Lerp.html</a>.</p>
			<p>We now need to add a single line of code in the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerSpawner</strong> script to turn the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script on after the player leaves the shop scene. As mentioned earlier in the chapter, if the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> was left on in the shop scene, the <strong class="source-inline">player_ship</strong> would animate across the screen.</p>
			<p>So, to turn on the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script at the start of the <strong class="source-inline">level1</strong> scene, we need to do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window, navigate to <strong class="source-inline">Assets/Script</strong> and open the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerSpawner</strong> script.</li>
				<li>Scroll down to the following line of code:<p class="source-code">playerShip.transform.position = Vector3.zero;</p></li>
				<li>Enter the following line of code just after it:<p class="source-code">playerShip.GetComponent&lt;PlayerTransition&gt;().enabled = true;</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This line of code will make our player ship animate into the <strong class="source-inline">level1</strong> scene.</p>
			<p>The last change we need to make in the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerSpawner</strong> script is to remove the ability to enable the <strong class="source-inline">Player</strong> script in the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerSpawner Start</strong> function, we will enable this in the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">In the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerSpawner</strong> script, remove the following line in the <strong class="source-inline">Start</strong> function:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">GetComponentInChildren&lt;Player&gt;().enabled = true;</strong></p></li>
				<li>Save the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerSpawner</strong> script.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, let's<a id="_idIndexMarker670"/> move onto the last bit of code, where<a id="_idIndexMarker671"/> we'll be moving our player ship out of the screen at the end of the level.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Moving the player ship out of the screen</h2>
			<p>The last<a id="_idIndexMarker672"/> method we need to cover in the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script is the <strong class="source-inline">SpeedOff</strong> method. This method simply makes our player's ship jet off, out of the screen, when the level is completed. Let's take a look:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Enter the following code in our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script:<p class="source-code"> void SpeedOff() { transform.Translate(Vector3.left * Time.deltaTime*800); }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This code block uses Unity's pre-made <strong class="source-inline">Translate</strong> function, which takes a <strong class="source-inline">Vector3.left</strong> multiplied by time, with <strong class="source-inline">800</strong> being used to make the player ship move a little faster.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Save the script.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That is the end of the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script. Now, our game has an introduction and an ending for our player ship. Originally, our player would just be present at the start of the level and when it was classed as being completed, the next level would load. We also technically covered three new functions, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Vector3.Distance</strong>, which measures between two <strong class="source-inline">Vector3</strong> points</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Vector3.Lerp</strong>, which moves the player ship, smoothing between two <strong class="source-inline">Vector3</strong> points</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">MathF.Round</strong>, which rounds off a number</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We combined these new skills to make our player ship move into position to start the level and, when completed, no matter where the player was on the screen, we moved them into <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>position. Finally, our player zooms off the screen.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we are going to revisit the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script and apply some code so that there's a time limit, counting down to when the level is over.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Expanding our ScenesManager script </h1>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker674"/>section, we are going to make our <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script recognize levels 2 and 3 from our <strong class="source-inline">scenes</strong> folder (<strong class="source-inline">Assets/Scene</strong>).  We will then add these levels to the game loop. Also, we will be adding a game timer for each level. When the timer reaches its limit, we can then trigger the player leaving the level with an animation that will play out. Lastly, we will add a few common methods to move the game onto the next level.</p>
			<p>Let's start by opening the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script (<strong class="source-inline">Assets/Script/Scenesmanager.cs</strong>) and adding some variables to assist with what we were talking about. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">At the top of the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script, add the following variables:<p class="source-code">  float gameTimer = 0;  float[] endLevelTimer = {30,30,45};  int currentSceneNumber = 0;  bool gameEnding = false;</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">gameTimer</strong> variable timer will be used as our current counter to time how long the level has left until it is over. The following variable is an array that holds the time until each level ends. So, we have three levels in total, but the question is, how long do we want each level to last? We need to enter a value that represents the seconds until the level ends, so I've chosen <strong class="source-inline">30</strong> seconds for levels 1 and 2.  Level 3, however, will last 45 seconds. This is because we will be building a special level in , <em class="italic">NavMesh, Timeline, and a Mock Test</em>. We will go into more detail about this when we reach that chapter.</p>
			<p>As you can imagine, <strong class="source-inline">currentSceneNumber</strong> will hold the number that denotes which scene our player is currently on. Lastly, we have the <strong class="source-inline">gameEnding</strong> bool, which will be used to trigger the end of the level animation for the player's ship. We will cover these variables in more detail later in this section, let's start with <strong class="source-inline">currentSceneNumber</strong>.</p>
			<p>Following on from the global variables we just set, let's make sure that the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script is always aware of what scene our player is on during the game. This will help our code know which scene the player is on and what scene they will be going to next.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Add the <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function, which will be called on every frame to check which scene we<a id="_idIndexMarker675"/> are at. Do this by entering the following code in the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script:<p class="source-code">  void Update()  {    if (currentSceneNumber !=       SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex)    {      currentSceneNumber = SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex;      GetScene();    }    GameTimer();  }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Inside the <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function, we use an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> condition to check if the <strong class="source-inline">currentSceneNumber</strong> variable is not equal to the <strong class="source-inline">buildIndex</strong> we are grabbing from the active scene we are in.</p>
			<p>If it is not equal, we update <strong class="source-inline">currentSceneNumber</strong> with the current scene's <strong class="source-inline">buildIndex</strong>, followed by the <strong class="source-inline">GetScene</strong> method. The <strong class="source-inline">GetScene</strong> method is a small method that is worth covering now instead of later as it relates to everything we've just said.</p>
			<p>Inside the <strong class="source-inline">GetScene</strong> method is a single line of code that updates the scene's variable. This is an instance from the <strong class="source-inline">Scenes</strong> <strong class="source-inline">enum</strong> that holds the names for each scene in our game. Also, the code in the <strong class="source-inline">GetScene</strong> method is casting <strong class="source-inline">currentSceneNumber</strong> to an <strong class="source-inline">enum</strong>, which is why the <strong class="source-inline">Scenes</strong> type is in brackets. More about casting can be found at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/casting-and-type-conversions">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/casting-and-type-conversions</a>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Enter the following code for our <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script:<p class="source-code">  void GetScene()  {    scenes = (Scenes)currentSceneNumber;  }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can put the <strong class="source-inline">GetScene</strong> method anywhere in the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> class, as long as it's not within another method.</p>
			<p>Coming back to the <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function, after calling the <strong class="source-inline">GetScene</strong> method, we close the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> conditions brackets. The last thing we do before closing the <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function is run the <strong class="source-inline">GameTimer</strong> method, which will keep track of our game's time and set up some basic methods that will start, reset, and end our game levels.</p>
			<p>In the following sections, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adding<a id="_idIndexMarker676"/> a timer to each game level. When the timer is up, that notifies the player has completed the level.</li>
				<li>Make it so that when a level is completed, the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script knows what to do next; that is, load a level, which level, and so on.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's get started.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Adding a game level timer</h2>
			<p>In the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script, we will set up a method that will be responsible for acknowledging <a id="_idIndexMarker677"/>the level has ended. The <strong class="source-inline">GameTimer</strong> method serves the purpose of adding time to a <strong class="source-inline">gameTimer</strong> variable and checking to see if it has reached its limit, depending on the <strong class="source-inline">endLevelTimer</strong> it's comparing to. Finally, if the game has been triggered to end the player ship's animation, it is set to start and the next level is loaded after <strong class="source-inline">4</strong> seconds.</p>
			<p>With <a id="_idIndexMarker678"/>your <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script still open, add the following method to your code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">void GameTimer() {   switch (scenes)   {     case Scenes.level1 : case Scenes.level2 : case Scenes.level3 :     {         if (gameTimer &lt; endLevelTimer[currentSceneNumber-3])        {           //if level has not completed            gameTimer += Time.deltaTime;         }         else          {         //if level is completed          if (!gameEnding)         {            gameEnding = true;            if (SceneManager.GetActiveScene().name != "level3")          {            GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("Player").    GetComponent                 &lt;PlayerTransition&gt;().LevelEnds = true;          }          else           {            GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("Player").    GetComponent                &lt;PlayerTransition&gt; ().GameCompleted = true;                                                                                                                     }             Invoke("NextLevel",4);         }       }      break;     }    } }</p>
			<p>Inside <a id="_idIndexMarker679"/>the <strong class="source-inline">GameTimer</strong> method, we run a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement holding the <strong class="source-inline">scenes</strong> instance that will contain all of the <strong class="source-inline">enum</strong> names of each level. We run a check on three possible cases: <strong class="source-inline">level1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">level2</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">level3</strong>. If the <strong class="source-inline">scenes</strong> instance is set to either of the three possibilities, we will fall into an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> condition that will then compare whether the <strong class="source-inline">gameTimer</strong> variable is less than what the <strong class="source-inline">endLevelTimer</strong> array has been set to. </p>
			<p>We only need to know what build index number levels 1, 2, and 3 are on. So, to avoid the first three scenes, we must subtract by <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>. </p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong> window (<strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong>), which contains the scenes and their build numbers in your project on the right-hand side:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer216" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.03_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 7.3 – Build Settings – scene order&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.3 – Build Settings – scene order</p>
			<p>If <strong class="source-inline">gameTimer</strong> is less than <strong class="source-inline">levelTimer</strong>, we will continue to increment <strong class="source-inline">gameTimer</strong> with the <strong class="source-inline">Time.deltaTime</strong> fixed function that Unity has pre-made for us. More information about <strong class="source-inline">Time.deltaTime</strong> can be found here: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html</a>.</p>
			<p>If <strong class="source-inline">gameTimer</strong> is equal to or more than <strong class="source-inline">levelTimer</strong>, we will move into the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> condition, which checks the condition of the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement of the <strong class="source-inline">gameEnding</strong> <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> being <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>. If the condition is <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, we fall into the content of the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement, which first sets the <strong class="source-inline">gameEnding</strong> <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>. This will stop the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement from repeating in the <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function's frame cycle.</p>
			<p>The last <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement checks which level our game is on. If we are not on <strong class="source-inline">"level3"</strong>, we set the <strong class="source-inline">LevelEnds</strong> property in the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>. Otherwise, we must have completed the game. So, in the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> condition, we set the <strong class="source-inline">GameComplete</strong> property to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerTransition</strong> script.</p>
			<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker680"/> section, we created a method in the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script that made our game aware of how long each level will last before classing the level as completed.</p>
			<p>We will now continue with the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script by adding methods that will start, reset, and move our player onto the next level when triggered by the <strong class="source-inline">GameTimer</strong> method.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Beginning, resetting, and skipping levels</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> will<a id="_idIndexMarker681"/> have the <a id="_idIndexMarker682"/>responsibility of<a id="_idIndexMarker683"/> starting a level, resetting it when the player dies, and moving onto the next level when the current one has been completed. Thankfully, these require minimal work thanks to Unity's <strong class="source-inline">SceneManagement</strong> library.</p>
			<p>Let's start by revisiting the <strong class="source-inline">ResetScene</strong> method we have already started, but now, we will simplify it even more:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Replace the content from our <strong class="source-inline">ResetScene</strong> method with the following code in our <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script:<p class="source-code">  public void ResetScene()  {    gameTimer = 0;    SceneManager.LoadScene(GameManager.currentScene);  }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Inside<a id="_idIndexMarker684"/> the <strong class="source-inline">ResetScene</strong> method, we<a id="_idIndexMarker685"/> reset the <strong class="source-inline">gameTimer</strong> variable<a id="_idIndexMarker686"/> to zero, followed by replacing its parameter from the current <strong class="source-inline">SceneManager.LoadScene</strong> <strong class="source-inline">buildIndex</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">GameManager.currentScene</strong>, which we coded back in <a href="B18381_03_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Scripts and Taking aMock Test</em>. This is basically just holding the current build index as a <strong class="source-inline">static</strong> integer so that any script can access it.</p>
			<p>With <strong class="source-inline">ResetScene</strong> updated, we can now move onto the next method, which is very similar to what we have just done, but it is separate to <strong class="source-inline">ResetScene</strong> in order to support the expansion of our code.</p>
			<p>When a player completes a level, the <strong class="source-inline">NextLevel</strong> method runs, which will reset the <strong class="source-inline">gameTimer</strong> variable. The <strong class="source-inline">gameTimer</strong> <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> will be set back to <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> and the same <strong class="source-inline">SceneManager.LoadScene</strong> command will be used to increment the <strong class="source-inline">GameManager</strong> <strong class="source-inline">currentScene</strong> integer by <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Enter the following method in the <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script:<p class="source-code">  void NextLevel()  {    gameEnding = false;    gameTimer = 0;    SceneManager.LoadScene(GameManager.currentScene+1);  }</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The last method we need to change in our <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script is our <strong class="source-inline">BeginGame</strong> method, which will be called when the player is in the <strong class="source-inline">shop</strong> scene and pressing the <strong class="source-inline">"START"</strong> button.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Enter the following code for our <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script:<p class="source-code"> public void BeginGame(int gameLevel) {   SceneManager.LoadScene(gameLevel); }}</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">BeginGame</strong> method <a id="_idIndexMarker687"/>will take<a id="_idIndexMarker688"/> an <a id="_idIndexMarker689"/>integer parameter called <strong class="source-inline">gameLevel</strong>. Inside this method is the same <strong class="source-inline">SceneManager.LoadScene</strong> we have already used, but this time, it will load the <strong class="source-inline">gameLevel</strong> integer we are providing it. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Save the script.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you remember, back in the previous chapter we set the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerSpawner</strong> script to temporary call the <strong class="source-inline">GameManager.Instance.CameraSetup()</strong>;</p>
			<p>This call is no longer required and can now be removed. Let's remove it</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">In the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window, navigate to <strong class="source-inline">Assets/Script</strong>.</li>
				<li>Load the PlayerSpawner script and remove the line from the Start function <strong class="source-inline">GameManager.Instance.CameraSetup();</strong></li>
				<li>Save the script.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Because we have changed the <strong class="source-inline">BeginGame</strong> method to now take a parameter, we must update our <strong class="source-inline">PlayerShipBuild</strong> script, which has a <strong class="source-inline">StartGame</strong> method that runs the <strong class="source-inline">BeginGame</strong> method with, currently, no parameter value. To update the <strong class="source-inline">PlayerShipBuild</strong> <strong class="source-inline">StartGame</strong> method, we need to do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the Unity Editor, navigate to the <strong class="source-inline">Assets/Script/PlayerShipBuild.cs</strong> folder in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window and open it.</li>
				<li>Scroll down to the <strong class="source-inline">StartGame</strong> method and find this line of code:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">UnityEngine.SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene("testLevel");</strong></p></li>
				<li>Now, change the preceding line of code to this:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">GameManager.Instance.GetComponent&lt;ScenesManager&gt;   ().BeginGame(GameManager.gameLevelScene);</strong></p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This code change will now call the <strong class="source-inline">level1</strong> scene directly.</p>
			<p>With that, we have reached the end of this section. So far, we have covered the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Our game is now aware of how long a level will take until it is classed as completed.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">ScenesManager</strong> script can now call methods that will start, reset, and move the player onto the next level.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The majority of our code was created with the use of <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements and an <strong class="source-inline">enum</strong> to call when the scenes need to be changed. To load the scenes themselves, we used <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>Unity's own <strong class="source-inline">SceneManager</strong> class, which <a id="_idIndexMarker691"/>is fundamental to loading<a id="_idIndexMarker692"/> any scene in a Unity Project.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will prepare the rest of the scenes in our project that aren't game levels (the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene, the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> scene, and the <strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong> scene).</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Preparing to loop our game</h1>
			<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker693"/>are going to move away from the <strong class="source-inline">testLevel</strong> scene and introduce three other levels (<strong class="source-inline">level1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">level2</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">level3</strong>) to demonstrate the game loop. </p>
			<p>By the end of this section, our game loop will be complete. We will be able to start our game from the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene. From there, we will be able to progress through each scene.</p>
			<p>Let's start by removing the placeholder levels in the Unity Editor. Go to the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window and the <strong class="source-inline">Assets/Scene</strong> location. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Make sure your <strong class="source-inline">player_ship</strong> is saved (<strong class="bold">Overrides | Apply All</strong>) and deleted from the <strong class="source-inline">testLevel</strong> scene. Next, Delete <strong class="source-inline">level1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">level2</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">level3</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="source-inline">testLevel</strong>, hold the <em class="italic">Left Ctrl</em> <em class="italic">(Command</em> on the Mac) key on the keyboard, and press <em class="italic">D</em> twice. We should now have three <strong class="source-inline">testLevel</strong> instances.</li>
				<li>Rename <strong class="source-inline">testLevel</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">level1</strong>.</li>
				<li>Rename <strong class="source-inline">testLevel 1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">level2</strong>.</li>
				<li>Rename <strong class="source-inline">testLevel 2</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">level3</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We now need to check the <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong> window to check on the order of our scenes.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">At the top of the Unity Editor, click <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Build Settings.</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Our order should <a id="_idIndexMarker694"/>look like the one shown in the following screenshot. If it doesn't, select and move the scenes into the correct position by clicking and dragging them in the <strong class="bold">Build Settings</strong> window and by selecting and deleting any extra scenes in the list:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer217" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.04_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 7.4 – Build Settings – complete scene order&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.4 – Build Settings – complete scene order</p>
			<p>We have duplicated our first level twice to test that our levels can be completed and move forward. Next, we will go back to the first scene in our project list and set it up so that it's ready to act like a boot up scene.</p>
			<p>Because we have removed our <strong class="source-inline">testLevel</strong> scene, we need to update our <strong class="source-inline">GameManager</strong> script with regards to the <strong class="source-inline">LightandCameraSetup</strong> method to keep its <strong class="source-inline">Switch</strong> statement in sync with the levels we need to light up, as well as set up our camera.</p>
			<p>To make it so our camera and lights work correctly for each scene, we need to do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window, navigate to the <strong class="source-inline">Assets/Script</strong> folder.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Double-click on the <strong class="source-inline">GameManager</strong> script.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Scroll<a id="_idIndexMarker695"/> down to the <strong class="source-inline">LightandCameraSetup</strong> method's content and make it so that each case number follows this pattern:<p class="source-code">case 3 : case 4 : case 5:</p></li>
			</ol>

			<p>In the next few sections, we will be customizing a placeholder look for each nonlevel scene (basic but informative). These scenes are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">title</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each of these scenes will also require basic coding so that the player either presses a button to continue or a timer will be issued. This timer will count down until the next scene is loaded.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Setting up the bootUp scene</h2>
			<p>When we <a id="_idIndexMarker696"/>run a game, typically, the game doesn't<a id="_idIndexMarker697"/> start straight away – there's normally a splash screen to show who developed/published the game. Sometimes, it's used as a loading screen, but for us, it will be used to get our game started. In this section, we are going to take away the typical Unity sky background and replace it with a neutral grey color background with a text title that states what screen has loaded up.</p>
			<p>Let's make a start and open the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene in the Unity Editor:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window, navigate to the <strong class="source-inline">level1</strong> scene by going to <strong class="source-inline">Assets/Scene</strong>.</li>
				<li>Double-click on <strong class="bold">level1</strong>, drag and drop the <strong class="bold">GameManager</strong> game object into the <strong class="source-inline">prefab</strong> folder if it isn't already.</li>
				<li>Next, double-click on the bootUp scene file from <strong class="source-inline">Assets/Scene</strong>.</li>
				<li>Drag and drop the <strong class="source-inline">GameManager</strong> prefab from the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window location, <strong class="source-inline">Assets/Prefab</strong>, to the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window.</li>
				<li>Create an empty game object in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window. If you have forgotten how to do this, refer to <a href="B18381_02_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Adding and Manipulating Objects</em>.</li>
				<li>Name the newly created game object <strong class="source-inline">BootUpText</strong>.</li>
				<li>Create another empty game object as before and name that <strong class="source-inline">BootUpComponent</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the components on the left-hand side of the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window. These are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Main Camera</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Direction Light</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">GameManager</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">BootUpComponent</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">BootUp Text</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer218" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.5 – Game object Hierarchy window order</p>
			<p>On the right-hand side of the preceding screenshot, we have our <strong class="source-inline">GameManager</strong> game object <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>selected showing its three main component <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>scripts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Game Manager</li>
				<li>Scenes Manager</li>
				<li>Score Manager</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you may recall, our <strong class="source-inline">GameManager</strong> script will always remain in a scene, even if the scene is replaced with another, so it's vital we have these components in our Game Manager prefab.</p>
			<p>Next, we are going to change the background from sky to grey, as mentioned previously. To do this, select <strong class="bold">Main Camera</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window. Now, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window, click the <strong class="bold">Clear Flags</strong> selection and change it from <strong class="bold">Skybox</strong> to <strong class="bold">Solid Color</strong>.</li>
				<li>Just below <strong class="bold">Clear Flags</strong>, click to change the <strong class="bold">Background</strong> selection and replace whatever the <strong class="bold">Hex Color</strong> value is with <strong class="source-inline">32323200</strong>.</li>
				<li>This will change the RGB values to <strong class="source-inline">50</strong>,<strong class="source-inline">50</strong>,<strong class="source-inline">50</strong> with an alpha setting of <strong class="source-inline">zero</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Use the following screenshot as a reference for the location for <strong class="bold">Clear Flags</strong>, <strong class="bold">Background</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Hex Color</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer219" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.6 – Changing the background color of our scene</p>
			<p>This will <a id="_idIndexMarker700"/>change the <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>background in the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> window to gray.</p>
			<p>Next, we will select <strong class="source-inline">BootUpText</strong> and add a <strong class="bold">Text Mesh</strong> that will be at the bottom center of the screen. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the <strong class="source-inline">BootUpText</strong> game object in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window.</li>
				<li> Then, in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window, click the <strong class="bold">Add Component</strong> button.</li>
				<li>In the drop-down, type <strong class="source-inline">Text Mes</strong>h until you see it in the drop-down list.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Text Mesh</strong> from the drop-down.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>With the <strong class="source-inline">BootUp Text</strong> game object still selected, change its <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> Position to the following:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer220" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Table_011.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Now that our text is in the correct position, we need to fill out the <strong class="bold">Text Mesh</strong> component in <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong>. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Text</strong> section of <strong class="bold">Text Mesh</strong>, type <strong class="source-inline">BootUp</strong>.</li>
				<li>Set <strong class="bold">Anchor</strong> to <strong class="bold">Middle center</strong>.</li>
				<li>Set <strong class="bold">Alignment</strong> to <strong class="bold">Center</strong>.</li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">Game</strong> window (shortcut: <em class="italic">Ctrl (command</em> on Mac<em class="italic">) + 2</em>). Now, we should have a gray screen with white text so that we can easily identify the scene<a id="_idIndexMarker702"/> we are in. The following screenshot<a id="_idIndexMarker703"/> shows the "<strong class="bold">BootUp</strong>" text's settings, along with its <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> properties for reference:</li>

			<p>The last thing we need to do for this <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene is to make it function like most <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> screens. </p>
			<p>When the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> screen appears, it stays there for a couple of seconds and then moves onto the next scene.</p>
			<p>To make it so the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> screen loads onto the next screen after a few seconds, we will need to create a script and add it to the <strong class="source-inline">BootUpComponent</strong> game object. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">When we make the script, we need to store it with our other scripts in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window (<strong class="source-inline">Assets/Script</strong>).</li>

				<li value="7">Double-click the grayed-out field of <strong class="source-inline">LoadSceneComponent</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window to open the file.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following code is similar to the code that we entered previously for loading a level, just in a shorter form. The basic principle is that we load in <strong class="source-inline">UnityEngine.SceneManagement</strong> to inherit Unity's <strong class="source-inline">SceneManager</strong> class. </p>
			<p>Our game's score gets reset at the start of the script to stop any previous scores being carried over.</p>
			<p>Then, we create a timer and increment the time in Unity's <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong> function. Once the timer goes over <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> seconds, <strong class="source-inline">SceneManager</strong> will load whatever we have put in the <strong class="source-inline">loadThisScene</strong> public variable, which in our case is <strong class="source-inline">"title"</strong>.</p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>screenshot <a id="_idIndexMarker707"/>shows the <strong class="source-inline">LoadSceneComponent</strong> script in <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> with a field where we can enter the scene we wish to load:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.9 – Load Scene Component will load the 'title' scene</p>
			<p>It's as simple as that – we don't need to worry about anything else as the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene isn't part of the game loop. The <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene is only played once when the game starts.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">Enter the following code into <strong class="source-inline">LoadSceneComponent</strong>:<p class="source-code">using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;using UnityEngine;public class LoadSceneComponent : MonoBehaviour { float timer = 0; public string loadThisScene; void Start(){  GameManager.Instance.GetComponentInChildren      &lt;ScoreManager&gt;().ResetScore();} void Update() {     timer += Time.deltaTime;     if (timer &gt; 3)     {         SceneManager.LoadScene(loadThisScene);     } }}</p></li>
				<li>Once <a id="_idIndexMarker708"/>you're <a id="_idIndexMarker709"/>done, save the script.</li>
				<li>Go back into the Unity Editor and type <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> into the <strong class="source-inline">loadThisScene</strong> variable field in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window, as shown in the preceding screenshot.</li>
				<li>Save the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene and press <strong class="bold">Play</strong> in the Unity Editor. The <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene should load up and then, after <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> seconds, load up the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> scene.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can now <a id="_idIndexMarker710"/>repeat the majority of what we've done in the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene <a id="_idIndexMarker711"/>and duplicate this for the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong> scenes. We will do this next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Setting up the title and gameOver scenes</h2>
			<p>The way <a id="_idIndexMarker712"/>we<a id="_idIndexMarker713"/> set<a id="_idIndexMarker714"/> the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene in the previous<a id="_idIndexMarker715"/> section is similar to how we want the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong> scenes to look and act before we add any new art and custom functionality.</p>
			<p>Thankfully, with Unity, we don't have to repeat the entire process of making these two scenes from scratch. We can copy, paste, and rename the game objects we have already created in the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene's <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window and paste them into the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong> scenes.</p>
			<p>To copy the gray background and white <strong class="bold">Text Mesh</strong> text from the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene, do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">With the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene still active in the Unity Editor, select all of the <strong class="source-inline">5</strong> game objects from the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window (click the top or the bottom of the list, hold <em class="italic">Shift</em>, then click either end of the list to select all).</li>
				<li>Press <em class="italic">Left Ctrl</em> (<em class="italic">Command</em> on Mac) <em class="italic">+ C</em> to copy these <strong class="source-inline">5</strong> game objects. </li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> scene from the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window (<strong class="source-inline">Assets/Scene</strong>).</li>
				<li>Select and delete all game objects in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window.</li>
				<li>Click anywhere in the open space of the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window and hold <em class="italic">Left Ctrl </em>(<em class="italic">Command</em> on Mac) <em class="italic">+ V</em> to paste the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> game objects.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="source-inline">BootUpText</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window and rename it <strong class="source-inline">TitleText</strong>.</li>
				<li>With the <strong class="source-inline">TitleText</strong> game object still selected, change the <strong class="bold">Text</strong> field in the <strong class="bold">Text Mesh</strong> component to <strong class="source-inline">Title</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="source-inline">BootUpComponent</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window and rename it to <strong class="source-inline">TitleComponent</strong>.</li>
				<li>With the <strong class="source-inline">TitleComponent</strong> game object still selected, click the three small dots in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window next to <strong class="bold">LoadSceneComponent </strong>(<strong class="bold">Script</strong>)<strong class="bold">.</strong></li>
				<li>A drop-down will appear; click <strong class="bold">Remove Component</strong> from it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We now need to make a script for the <strong class="source-inline">TitleComponent</strong> game object so that<a id="_idIndexMarker716"/> when the player taps or clicks the<a id="_idIndexMarker717"/> mouse<a id="_idIndexMarker718"/> button, the <strong class="source-inline">shop</strong> scene will load <a id="_idIndexMarker719"/>up next.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="11">Repeat the same process of making and attaching a script as we did with <strong class="source-inline">BootUpComponent</strong>, but this time, name the script <strong class="source-inline">TitleComponent</strong> (also, as with the <strong class="source-inline">TitleComponent</strong> script, make sure it is moved into the correct folder in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window, <strong class="source-inline">Assets/Script</strong>) and paste in the following code:<p class="source-code">using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;using UnityEngine;public class TitleComponent : MonoBehaviour { void Update() {     if (Input.GetButtonDown("Fire1"))     {         SceneManager.LoadScene("shop");     } }  void Start()  {    GameManager.playerLives = 3;  }}</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The difference between this <strong class="source-inline">TitleComponent</strong> script and the previous <strong class="source-inline">BootUpComponent</strong> script is that <strong class="source-inline">TitleComponent</strong> will move onto <a id="_idIndexMarker720"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker721"/>next<a id="_idIndexMarker722"/> scene (<strong class="source-inline">shop</strong> scene) when<a id="_idIndexMarker723"/> a mouse button (or a finger on a touch screen) is pressed and released in <strong class="bold">Play</strong> mode. And as a temporary solution, it will make sure, as a failsafe, that the player starts with three lives. This is unlike <strong class="source-inline">BootUpComponent</strong>, which is dependent on a timer to increment the past <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> seconds to load the next scene, where its failsafe is to reset the game's score if the player completes the game.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="12">Save the <strong class="source-inline">TitleComponent</strong> script and <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> scene.</li>

			<p>We now need to repeat the exact same process for the <strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong> scene.</p>
			<p>Open the <strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong> scene from the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window (<strong class="source-inline">Assets/Scene</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker724"/>repeat<a id="_idIndexMarker725"/> the process <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>of pasting and renaming the game objects. Do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window, change the name of the <strong class="source-inline">BootUpComponent</strong> game object to <strong class="source-inline">GameOver</strong>.</li>
				<li>Still in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window, rename <strong class="source-inline">BootUpText</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">GameOverText</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="source-inline">GameOver</strong> component in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window. Then, in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window, click the <strong class="bold">Add Component</strong> button and type <strong class="source-inline">LoadSceneComponent</strong> until we see it in the list. Then, select it if we don't have the component added already..</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the <strong class="source-inline">GameOver</strong> component with the same <strong class="source-inline">LoadSceneComponent</strong> script where I added <strong class="source-inline">"title"</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">loadThisScene</strong> variable field:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Demonstrating that the game loop is complete</h2>
			<p>In this final <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>section, we will confirm what we have achieved in this chapter. Our game now has a game loop, so if we load up the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> scene and press <strong class="bold">Play</strong> in the Unity Editor, the sequence will be as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong>: The scene runs for <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> seconds and then moves to the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> scene.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">title</strong>: If the player presses the mouse button, the <strong class="source-inline">shop</strong> scene will load.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">shop</strong>: The player presses the <strong class="bold">START</strong> button to load <strong class="source-inline">level1</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">level1</strong>: The player completes the level after <strong class="source-inline">30</strong> seconds (45 seconds for level 3) or dies. If the player dies more than <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> times, they will be presented with the <strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong> scene.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">level2</strong>: The same rules apply as the ones present for <strong class="source-inline">level1</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">level3</strong>: The same rules apply as the ones present for <strong class="source-inline">level1</strong>, but if the player completes the level, they will be presented with the <strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong> scene.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong>: The scene runs for <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> seconds and then moves to the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> scene.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following image shows the process of our game loop moving through each scene, then going back to the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> scene:</p>

			<p class="callout">Remember that if any of our scenes look darker than usual, we will need to bake its lights manually, as we did back in <a href="B18381_03_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Scripts and Taking a Mock Test.</em></p>
			<p>With this, we have created a series of scenes that carry their own individual responsibilities. When a scene comes to its end, either by its own choice or prompted to by the player, the next scene in the sequence will load. Eventually, by the player either completing all three levels or losing all their lives, our game will reach the <strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong> scene. From the <strong class="source-inline">gameOver</strong> scene, we send the player back to the <strong class="source-inline">title</strong> scene. This is our game loop, and this is what every game will have. Game loops are a fundamental requirement<a id="_idIndexMarker732"/> for game development, and it's also possible that this will be mentioned in the exam.</p>
			<p>This concludes this section and this chapter, where we have created and managed our scenes in order to create a game loop.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we created a game loop; these are fundamental to game development, and sometimes application development. To create a game loop for our project, we needed multiple scenes that served their own purposes. We also needed to know when a scene started and when it should end. A scene ends when the player presses a button to continue, such as the <strong class="source-inline">7</strong> scene, or when the <strong class="source-inline">bootUp</strong> title automatically moves onto the next scene after so many seconds.</p>
			<p>Apart from making our game loops, we also learned some new vector math components on the way, including <strong class="source-inline">Mathf.round</strong>, which is used to round off figures <strong class="source-inline">Vector3.distance</strong>, which is used to measure the distance between two <strong class="source-inline">Vector3</strong> points; and <strong class="source-inline">Vector3.lerp</strong>, which is used to interpolate between two <strong class="source-inline">Vector3</strong> points. </p>
			<p>These are useful components in game development and will also likely be mentioned in the exam.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will be adding some polish to our placeholder scenes with custom fonts, creating our own images, and applying some UI animation in the Unity Editor.</p>
