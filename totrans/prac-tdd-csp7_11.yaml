    likely be added. Sometimes these requirements enhance the existing functionality
    of the application. At other times, these new requirements may conflict with the

    are resolved so that the proper functionality can be built.

    This may be in response to user feedback, clarification from the business, or
    a need discovered through use of the system. When the need for change is discovered,
    then the existing application will need to change. A comprehensive test suite
    will ensure that the rest of the system still operates as expected once the new
    changes are implemented. Start by modifying and/or creating new tests to cover
    the new desired functionality of the system.

    it is merely abandoned*. That is to say that an application will continue to grow
    and evolve through new development if it is to continue to be useful. If new features
    aren't being added, then it is likely that the project has simply been abandoned.
    If an application is to continue to be of use, then you can expect that new features
    will need to be implemented. Again, start with the tests and add new tests which
    will help guide your implementation of any and all new features.
