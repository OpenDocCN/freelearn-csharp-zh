The use of Physics in interactive development and software is not new, but its use has been the focus of special attention in recent years.</p><p class="calibre8">At first glance, Physics gives the impression that it's all about long, webbed equations and calculations. However, the contributions of Physics are tremendous and have made developer's life easy. The idea of gaming was possible only because of Physics. All of us remember our childhood games, which were facilitated by the use of Physics; for example, the Ping Pong game. Isn't it amazing how much Physics has touched our lives and how we cannot escape its influence? There are many games that possess primitive Physics, used to calculate the movement and trajectory of a bouncing ball. If you look into the structure of Physics used for one of the earliest games, Pong, you get a brief insight into how Physics was used in these games. Game behavior, motion trajectory, and paddle movement were all handled by primitive Physics.</p><p class="calibre8">In this chapter, we will learn about the following topics:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">How Physics is used in interactive development</li><li class="listitem">The basic components of Physics for interactive development</li><li class="listitem">Physical simulation in Unity</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">In today's interactive world, the use of Physics is changing day by day. In recent years, the use of Physics in games, software, and interactive development has increased drastically. Now, we are able to make games and other applications using Physics in different ways. In the modern era, the importance of in-game Physics and interactive development has increased.</p><p class="calibre8">If you look at the way Physics was used in older interactive applications or games, you will find that they were all based on some specific scenarios. The Physics code was written according to the scenario of interactive development. For example, if the Physics code is written for a ball to handle its trajectory motion, it only handles the trajectory motion and nothing else; this means that every time a developer has to write a new code for a new effect. Also, with the passage of time, if an update is required, the developer has to modify or even rewrite the code. Based on such cases, development became very complicated and time-consuming. Conditions became worse when the number of scenarios increased. As mentioned earlier, the way Physics is used is changing day by day, and it is required in various sectors. Let's take a look at the areas where Physics is widely used these days:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00002.jpeg" alt="Introduction to Physics in Unity3D" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre8">Physics is useful in the following areas of <a id="id1" class="calibre1"/>interactive development:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Real-time programming where we need knowledge of electronics, which is much related to Physics</li><li class="listitem">A Physics engine for graphics software or games, where Physics is heavily used</li><li class="listitem">Creating 3D programs for various software and game engines</li><li class="listitem">Physics-based simulations</li></ul></div></div>

<a id="id2" class="calibre1"/> is the most common component used in interactive development. For Physics-based simulation development, we use algorithms of<a id="id3" class="calibre1"/> Rigidbody dynamics. Rigidbody dynamics is based on the Newtonian principle of movement and mass.</p><p class="calibre8">Now, the question that arises here is what is a Rigidbody? An idealized solid whose size and shape is fixed and remains unaltered when some external forces are applied and is used in Newtonian mechanics to model real objects is known as a Rigidbody. For example, a box, wall, and so on.</p><p class="calibre8">The use of accurate Physics in interactive development is not feasible as it has its own natural constraints. In interactive development, we cannot use accurate Physics due to the standard frame rate restrictions, but the physical accuracy of a simulation only needs to be believable.</p></div></div>

Physics simulations<a id="id4" class="calibre1"/> are related <a id="id5" class="calibre1"/>to the frame rate. The frame rate can be described as the number of frames that are displayed per second. This is relevant to animation, in which many images are displayed quickly to give the impression of movement. The standard frame rate for most PCs and console games is 60 fps.</p><p class="calibre8">The interval of moving objects with their trajectories is called Physics simulation. Almost every Physics simulation equation involves time, and the time required for solving this is determined by interactive development.</p></div></div></div>

Therefore, a situation arises where two objects are moving towards each other.</p><p class="calibre8">What will happen if no action is taken? These objects will just pass through each other. In most interactive developments, however, we don't want the objects to pass through each other.</p><p class="calibre8">In order to handle those <a id="id12" class="calibre1"/>scenarios where collision occurs, the interactive development needs to know that two objects are colliding. One of Physics' most important tasks is to identify these scenarios.</p><p class="calibre8">The collision detection<a id="id13" class="calibre1"/> code has to determine all such pairs of overlapping objects, collect some additional data such as how far they overlap and in which orientation, and provide this data to the interactive development for further processing.</p><p class="calibre8">In the later chapters, we will see how we can handle collision detection in Unity3D.</p></div></div>

In many cases, some specific rules are added to the interactive development.</p><p class="calibre8">For example, in a shooting game, when a bullet hits the player's ship, the game might decide to show an explosion animation. Following this, before removing the player's ship, the game might start the level again and reduce the number of lives of the player. These effects of the collision are driven by the game itself and not by Physics because they are very specific to the game.</p><p class="calibre8">However, there are certain cases where the game doesn't have to be involved.</p><p class="calibre8">We've covered the basics of all Physics components. Every simulation suitable for interactive development will have these components. Other than the covered topics, there are many more features to be included, such as joints, cloth simulations, Physics-based animations, and so on.</p></div></div>
