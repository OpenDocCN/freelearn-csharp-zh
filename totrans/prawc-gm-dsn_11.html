So, without further ado, let's begin!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_627"/>


<div id="filepos717948" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">User Experience</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">User Experience refers to a person's overall perception, emotional response, and attitude towards the use of a particular product or system. In the context of game development, UX can encompass anything that affects the overall feel of the game with exception to the rule set and game content. In practice, UX translates into input mechanisms (controls), menu and interaction flows, interface animations and sound effects, camera systems, and game feedback.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_629"/>


<div id="filepos718606" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Player input</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The design and execution of input methods (that is, <span class="italic">controls</span>) can make or break your game. In this day and age, players expect the developer to adhere to a set of <span class="italic">gold standards</span> in the input department. For this exact reason, platform holders such as Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft have created their own set of guidelines to ensure that platform-specific input methods and control functions (that is, how to pause the game) are adhered to.</p><p class="calibre_2">Nowadays, console action games are almost certain to use the <span class="italic">left analog stick</span> to move and <span class="italic">right stick</span> to look around, while PC ones are sure to use <span class="italic">WSAD</span> keys for movement, mouse to look and <span class="italic">Spacebar</span> to vault or jump over obstacles. Regardless of game genre, using anything but <span class="italic">Esc</span> to enter the pause menu on PC can be seen as a cardinal sin.</p><p class="calibre_2">Although the majority of your controls are not influenced by the platform holder, going against well-established paradigms is a very risky move. Try to give your players a way to modify and personalize their controls, but remember, the default settings are unlikely to be changed by most players. If your default controls are hard to use and unintuitive, you run a real risk of frustrating the audience to a point of leaving the game—no matter how extensive your control options are.</p><p class="calibre_2">It's more than likely that the games you'll work on come with a strong reference in the controls department (a similar game in your genre), and a set of player expectations (well-established paradigms). Innovation is where things become much more difficult. Novel control methods should be well-justified by innovative mechanics that cannot be effectively expressed with a familiar and well-established control mapping. That is, unless you're planning on focusing your entire game on having the players try to master the controls, as seen in games like the old flash-hit <span class="italic">QWOP</span> and the hilarious <span class="italic">Surgeon Simulator.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">The principles of ergonomic design (be it of objects, processes, or spaces) revolve around maximizing the productivity of the users and minimizing their fatigue and discomfort. When applied to video game controls, these rules can be summed up with the following statement:</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Ergonomic controls are easy to execute in the most common context.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">A single key or button press is easy enough on its own. However, pressing <span class="italic">P</span> while controlling your character with <span class="italic">WSAD</span> keys and the mouse requires you to stop and lift your hand, and therefore, is not an ergonomic solution.</p><p class="calibre_2">Actions that require multiple inputs (double taps) or more than one finger to execute are harder to pull off and memorize. This includes specific modifiers such as holding <span class="italic">Alt</span>, <span class="italic">Shift</span>, <span class="italic">Ctrl,</span> or a <span class="italic">trigger</span> on a gamepad.</p><p class="calibre_2">Well executed controls match the expected paradigm (for example, pressing <span class="italic">R</span> to reload in a shooter) and are easy to perform (no need for compound controls). They also shouldn't make us fight our instincts (a practice is known as natural mapping), for example, <span class="bold">holding</span> a button to <span class="bold">release</span> something in-game always feels a bit off.</p><p class="calibre_2">When considering controls and input mechanisms, it helps to list your game mechanics in order of priority and frequency of use. Afterward, go through the list and assign the most ergonomic and fitting actions to the most important and frequently used mechanics first. Following that, any actions that do not need to be performed quickly and efficiently (turning a flashlight, opening the inventory or map screen) can be put on inputs that are less accessible.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Use control prompts if you can afford the space! Control prompts such as press [E] to Open Door do not need to end with your tutorial. Unintrusive but persistent on-screen control prompts can be incredibly useful throughout a player's lifecycle. What's obvious to you (or a seasoned player) may not be obvious to someone who picks up the game after a year, especially if you map a whole array of obscure keys to a laundry list of actions.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_631"/>


<div id="filepos723352" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Control types</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">When designing your controls, it's important to understand the differences and implications of different input types available on your target platform.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_633"/>


<div id="filepos723702" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Digital input</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">This is the most basic input type, capable of returning one of two states, active (1) or inactive (0). A simple example of digital input lies in the keys of a standard computer keyboard. A single key can either be pressed or not pressed at all, there's no other state in between.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_635"/>


<div id="filepos724180" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Analog input</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Analog input can return one or more continuous values. The most popular example would be an <span class="italic">analog stick</span> found on any modern console controller. When a stick is tilted, the controller tracks separate values for up/down and left/right positions as well as the degree of the tilt. The formatting could look like this: (0, -1) for a stick that's turned left all the way, (-0.5, 0.3) for a stick that's tilted down halfway and 30% to the right. This allows for more subtle and natural control over things like movement or cursor speed.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Just because the controller grants you access to continuous states does not mean you should always use them. You could program the game to detect simple up and down states based on a single value, a tilt of 75% to 100% in Y-axis would be used for up and -75% to -100% for down. The zone between -75% and 75% is a so-called </span></span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">dead zone</span></span></span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> where the input is deemed insignificant and ignored. In this case, you're essentially turning analog input into digital input.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_637"/>


<div id="filepos725569" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Complex analog input</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Some controllers offer features like motion and position tracking, giving you access to very complex information. A <span class="italic">simple shake</span> of the controller would result in the creation of a set of <span class="italic">vectors</span> that track the speed, direction, and acceleration of the movement in all three axes as well as (for more advanced, camera-enabled systems) the starting and ending position in 3D space.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Designing motion controls can be a very complex process that requires close cooperation with a highly-skilled programmer. Compound motion controls (such as doing a figure of 8) are very hard to implement in a way that works reliably for most players and devices. Unless you're working on a motion controlled or virtual reality game and have a team of very experienced programmers, it's advisable to avoid motion controls (and especially complex ones) for core gameplay mechanics. You can, however, try to use the accelerometer for cosmetic effects. For example, by making the background of your user interface move as you tilt your mobile device (thus creating an illusion of depth).</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_639"/>


<div id="filepos726981" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Touch screen controls</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Some modern touchscreens are capable of tracking as many as 10 individual points of contact. Nevertheless, a simple set of single-finger taps and swipes can usually get you a long way. It's recommended to not rely on more than 4 fingertips as going above that number increases the chances of misinterpreting the input and reduces the number of compatible devices. A touch interface can provide you with:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">A unique ID for each contact point.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">The origin of contact (starting position).</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Current position.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Change in position and time since last update (used to track movement).</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Status since the last frame (touch started, moved, stationary, released and canceled): <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Cancellation can happen if more than 5 inputs are detected simultaneously or the device detects being put next to the user's ear (light sensor and position tracking).</li></ul></li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">The <span class="italic">intensity</span> of the touch, which only works on a select few devices that support <span class="italic">3D Touch</span> or equivalent technology. This feature allows you to distinguish between regular touch input and <span class="italic">force touch</span>, where the screen has been pressed in a more significant matter.</li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Similarly to motion controls, you need to tread with great care when integrating complex touch behaviors. Utilizing simple taps, swipes, drags, and pinches or following a pattern on the screen is all very easy and natural, but asking the user to use multiple fingers and 3D Touch without clear prompts is a recipe for disaster. There's no such thing as a simple 4-finger pinch. You may also want to discard any touch input that's too close to the currently active one, as a single finger can sometimes be read as two. It's common practice to manipulate interactive areas (hitboxes) of actors or buttons to make them bigger/smaller than their in-game artwork would suggest, making them easier/harder to tap on.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_641"/>


<div id="filepos729519" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Camera systems</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">In-game camera is one of the most important interfaces between the player and the game world. A well-designed camera exhibits behaviors and settings that not only help to inform the player but also highlight what’s important and improve the player's ability to interact with the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">There are multiple camera types and perspectives. A game can use a single camera with a fixed setting or switch between different cameras and settings depending on the context.</p><p class="calibre_2">To create a perfect camera system, you'll often have to work closely with the rest of your team, merging game design goals with technical solutions (intelligent camera focus and pathfinding) and an elusive artistic sensitivity (focused around framing, angles, and transitions).</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's dive into the complexities of camera design by analyzing different camera types and perspectives.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_643"/>


<div id="filepos730696" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Camera types</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Selection of a camera type often happens on a subconscious level; you simply imagine the game being played one way or another. That said, it's important to acknowledge the reasons behind a particular camera type and remain open to alternatives. By switching from a manual to static or tracking camera one could find a brand new way of presenting the game, reshaping the experience and potentially spawning an entirely new sub-genre of games. Don't be afraid to experiment!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_645"/>


<div id="filepos731366" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Static</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Simple, stationary cameras are used in many games where the game board is entirely contained on the screen such as <span class="italic">Tetris</span>. There are games that use a series of static cameras and toggle between them as needed. Examples of such systems can also be found in old semi-3D games such as the first <span class="italic">Resident Evil</span>, which often relied on pre-rendered backdrops. Controlling an avatar in 3D space with fixed cameras that often switch angles is particularly challenging and should be avoided:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00161.jpg" class="calibre_81"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">In </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Resident Evil 1</span></span><span class="calibre4">, ambiguous angles and disconnection between the camera and the character made for difficult controls</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Interestingly enough, the effect of static cameras on 2D spaces is entirely opposite, and games like <span class="italic">Super Meat Boy</span> are a testament to the increased precision one can get from removing camera movement in a 2D environment.</p><p class="calibre_2">Static cameras are also a very popular choice for puzzle games and mobile titles, where the free-form mouse, touch, and drag inputs are reserved for interactions with the game world and not camera operation. A static camera can also provide a natural parallel to interacting with a fictional workspace or computer interface, as seen in <span class="italic">Her Story</span>, where the player solves a murder case by operating an old computer.</p><p class="calibre_2">Taking the static camera to the limit and restricting yourself to one screen can act as a limitation that fosters creativity in level design, and makes the game easier to grasp for the casual audience (not having to move the camera around lowers the cognitive load).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_647"/>


<div id="filepos733459" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Manual camera</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Not attached to any actor, with players being in control of the camera work in varying degrees, including:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Two or three-dimensional movement panning the camera as well as zooming in and out</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Pivot (horizontal rotation)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Pitch (angle to the ground or the subject, vertical rotation)</li></ol><p class="calibre_2">Manual cameras can be found in many strategy games. Some, such as <span class="italic">Black</span> &amp; <span class="italic">White</span>, allow the player to pivot and pitch the camera freely with little limitations. Others, such as <span class="italic">StarCraft 2</span>, restrict the controls to simple two-dimensional movement (west, east, north, south), zooming in and out.</p><p class="calibre_2">Restricting the camera pitch and pivot controls can be done to prevent players from getting lost and disoriented by selecting angles that limit playability. Without limitations, players could not only look straight up into the sky but also flip the view of the game world upside down (by adjusting the pitch more than 180 degrees).</p><p class="calibre_2">A restricted camera can also be designed to automatically adjust certain settings such as pitch. For example, zooming in can lower the pitch to create a more cinematic angle, while zooming out could tilt the camera towards a more tactical, top-down perspective:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00094.jpg" class="calibre_82"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">In </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">StarCraft 2</span></span><span class="calibre4">, the camera pitch shifts towards a more side-on angle as you zoom in</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_649"/>


<div id="filepos735477" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Tracking camera</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Tracking cameras allow your players to enjoy big playable spaces without the burden of having to manually adjust the framing. Depending on gameplay and portrayed actors, the camera will either follow a single character, a point between multiple characters, or simply focus on the action itself and drag the players along:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Following the actor</span>: This is the default option for presenting character driven gameplay, from platform games to third person shooters and racing games. Moving the avatar moves the camera—simple, elegant, and effective.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Following the action</span>: An entirely autonomous first-person camera was often used in old arcade shooters such as <span class="italic">Virtua Cop</span> and <span class="italic">House of the Dead</span>. A camera that's <span class="italic">on-rails</span> sets the pacing and leaves little agency to the players who are simply taken in for a ride. On the other hand, we have third-person action games such as <span class="italic">God of War</span> and <span class="italic">Bayonetta</span> that feature semi-autonomous cameras that follow the character's journey across the environment but <span class="italic">aren't directly attached</span> to it. This design choice caters to the fast and jerky actions and complex encounters with a multitude of enemies coming from all sides. A semi-autonomous camera also allows for some very cinematic moments. There are also games that only use a semi-autonomous camera in some of their multiplayer modes, in order to portray all players on the same screen. From <span class="italic">Super Smash Bros</span> and <span class="italic">Micro Machines</span> to <span class="italic">Super Mario 3D World</span>, the camera will either follow the leader of a race who dictates the tempo or try to zoom out to keep all actors visible at the same time.</li></ol><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">The decision on what to track is an important one as it dictates the pace and framing of the action. A degree of autonomous behavior can let players focus on pure execution of gameplay mechanics, but it also opens up the possibility of time-consuming implementation and case-by-case adjustments. If players cannot adjust the camera themselves, you need to make sure they're always offered the optimal view of the action.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_651"/>


<div id="filepos738010" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Compound Camera</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Sometimes, a single solution does not cover the entirety of available gameplay scenarios. A compound camera is one that defaults to one of the above solutions but allows players to tweak or alter its behavior. This gives us two distinct options:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">A tracking camera that can be manually adjusted or taken control over:</span><br class="calibre1"/> Found in many 3D action adventure games that do not depend on ranged combat or platformers such as Super Mario Galaxy. Such a camera requires no agency until players are required to take aim or identify an area of interest that’s outside of their current view.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Manual camera with lock-on or focus options:</span><br class="calibre1"/> Fast paced close-quarters combat inside a 3D space can make aiming very tricky. The camera lock-on system allows you to track a chosen enemy target and aims your attacks in their direction. The lock-on camera is an essential element of combat mechanics in games such as <span class="italic">Dark Souls</span> and <span class="italic">The</span>
<span class="italic">Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</span>. On a side note, I've met designers that call lock-on systems an outcome of bad camera design and controls, but most players accept this solution without questioning it (especially if your combat is about timing and positioning, and not analyzing angles between characters on screen).<br class="calibre1"/> As for camera focus, it's a mechanic that can be found in games such as <span class="italic">Gears of War</span> and <span class="italic">The Last of Us</span>, where players are sometimes prompted to press a button to move their camera towards a point of interest (something that's relevant to the story or player's current objective). Players are free to <span class="italic">focus</span> their view for a few seconds, take a quick glimpse, or ignore the point of interest completely. You can never be sure if they followed the hint, but at least you don't take away their controls and interrupt them rudely with a cutscene.</li></ol><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_653"/>


<div id="filepos740199" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Viewing perspectives</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Similarly to camera type, the viewing perspective is often subconsciously set in your brain from the very first moment you think of the game being played.</p><p class="calibre_2">It's good to be aware of the implications of the perspective of your choosing, and question whether it’s the best choice, or if there are alternatives you should prototype. A new perspective can result in a completely different feel and create space for previously unavailable game mechanics.</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00080.jpg" class="calibre_83"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">As pictured by the tower defense genre, changing the camera can lead to a vastly different gameplay experience.

<div id="filepos741281" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">First person</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We live our lives in first person perspective, and thanks to the depth perception provided by a set of forward-facing eyes, we can judge distance accurately and navigate the three-dimensional world with ease. However, the most natural viewing perspective is not necessarily the easiest to control…</p><p class="calibre_2">First person games started simple, with slow-paced dungeon crawlers and keyboard only shooters such as <span class="italic">Wolfenstein 3D</span>. But not long after, the addition of mouse controls and the prevalence of strafing, jumping, and ducking made things much more complicated for the players:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00112.jpg" class="calibre_84"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">The steady movements of </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Wolfenstein 3D</span></span><span class="calibre4"> (1992) stand in stark contrast to the highly vertical action of </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Titanfall 2</span></span><span class="calibre4"> (2017), filled with sliding, wall-running, and grappling hooks</span></p><p class="calibre_2">For many casual gamers, learning to move the character and camera separately comes with great difficulty. Contrary to what we <span class="italic">gamers</span> tend to believe, it's neither simple nor natural. Moreover, fast-paced first person games are known to cause dizziness in a portion of the population. Take these factors into consideration if the audience you’re creating for is not very experienced with first person games.</p><p class="calibre_2">On the plus side, first person perspective puts players right into the middle of the action, creating some of the most immersive experiences (a natural fit for virtual reality). First person cameras are also simple to implement and tweak. And if you're working on a single player title, you could save a lot of time by reducing or eliminating the need for character modeling and animation.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_657"/>


<div id="filepos743463" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Third person</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We'll now explore the wide range of third person cameras where players become an external observer, looking at the game and its world through the portal of the screen.</p><p class="calibre_2">You could be a god, an army commander or a ZOO manager looking down at their creation. You might be in control of Nathan Drake or Mario, but you do not experience the world through their eyes. You embody a camera floating around in thin air, always close, yet somehow detached from the avatar on screen.</p><p class="calibre_2">Third person perspective excels in storytelling. A single framing can effectively convey complex interactions between any number of characters and the world they inhabit. No wonder it's arguably the most popular perspective in art and visual media, from graphic novels to theatre, movies, and of course games.</p><p class="calibre_2">In video games, there are countless iterations of third person cameras to choose from. We tend to narrow down the classification of <span class="bold">Third Person Perspective</span> (<span class="bold">TPP</span>) towards the classic <span class="italic">over the shoulder</span> games like Tomb Raider, but in fact, we have to consider any perspective that isn't first person. Let’s go into the details of the most popular variants!</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Behind an Avatar</span><br class="calibre1"/>There are many reasons why cameras positioned behind or over the shoulder of an in-game character are so popular. By exiting the first person perspective, we open the possibilities of extensive characterization through avatar's visual design, customization, and animation. Despite not being in the dead-center of the action, we quickly establish a powerful link between ourselves and the character. The epic on-screen adventures might not happen to me, but they do happen to Lara Croft, and in this world, I am Lara Croft.</p><p class="calibre_2">Gameplay wise, since we see the actors, we can switch control between multiple characters with ease, something that's harder to pull off in first person games. Moreover, having the camera detached from the character gives us the ability to peek behind corners and cover, and spot dangers and obstacles around/behind our character. This increases our situational awareness and brings it a bit closer to the standard we have in real-life. The nauseating effects of first person perspective are also reduced as the camera moves less erratically and doesn't bob (move up and down) with each step. Interacting with the environment and engaging in full-body movements is also much clearer when the whole character is visible on screen, from vaulting above obstacles to pulling crates and casting spells.</p><p class="calibre_2">As with everything, there are some downsides to keep in mind. For one, you may need to add complex character animations that could be omitted if you were making a single player game in first person, or if the camera was pulled further away. Moreover, you might need to either be very careful with the level design or invest considerable programming effort into ensuring that the camera behaves correctly in cramped environments. Low ceilings, narrow rooms and layers of obstacles such as tree branches will all make your camera struggle. In combat, having the main character occupy the middle of the screen can get in the way of aiming, forcing you to offset the view to the side (as seen in <span class="italic">Uncharted</span> and modern <span class="italic">Tomb Raider</span> games.).</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Top Down</span><br class="calibre1"/>Top down perspective is a perfect fit for any game that relies on two-dimensional planning and 360-degree horizontal visibility, making it a popular choice for fast-paced arcade action games, dungeon crawlers, strategy, and management titles. While it may struggle with accurately reflecting height, a top down camera can offer a clear view of countless actors and obstacles with little to no obstruction. Even the most complex buildings and mazes suddenly become easy to navigate floorplans.</p><p class="calibre_2">Nowadays, a truly top down perspective is rare. Most 3D games opt to tilt the camera while 2D ones cheat with the perspective and show a side-skewed view of the actors and/or the world. This means that characters are rarely reduced to uninspiring sets of heads and shoulders.</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00163.jpg" class="calibre_85"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">The first </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Grand Theft Auto</span></span><span class="calibre4"> augmented its top-down camera with an illusion of depth provided by angled building faces</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Isometric</span><br class="calibre1"/> In the context of video games, isometric camera refers to a form of two dimensional, axonometric projection (an orthographic projection with an oblique angle but without any perspective). It is a viewpoint that allows to more effectively exhibit depth in a 2D space and create a three-dimensional effect, something that’s hard to do in a purely top-down perspective or side view.</p><p class="calibre_2">Isometric projection can easily be associated with some of the most memorable PC games of the 1990s. This view was applied en-masse to role-playing games like <span class="italic">Fallout</span> or <span class="italic">Baldur’s Gate</span>, and dominated the huge strategy and simulation genres, from <span class="italic">Age of Empires</span> to <span class="italic">Simcity 2</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">As we write this book, a set of easily accessible 3D engines is dominating the market, and yet, isometric perspective is alive and well. In fact, isometric games are arguably some of the most popular ones on the planet… After all, casual titles like <span class="italic">Farmville</span> and <span class="italic">Clash of Clans</span> were able to easily attract millions of players into their isometric worlds.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Creating high-quality isometric art can be very time-consuming and pose a significant challenge to an inexperienced artist. To help with the process, an artist can either used advanced perspective settings or even 3D tools to model, rotate and export the assets.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Side view</span><br class="calibre1"/>By restricting movements to two dimensions, side view cameras can present an easy to read environment that's not unlike what we see with our own eyes—our world may not be flat, but it's definitely easier to read from the side than from the top. Platformers and fighting games can benefit greatly from more predictable character movements, distances and jump curves. Easy to read contours, angles and environments can also be infused with simple to understand 2D physics, spawning a genre of physics games from <span class="italic">Angry Birds</span> to <span class="italic">Worms</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">Some games opt to forego some of these benefits in order to infuse their side projections with elements of depth. This can be seen in old 2D adventure games such as <span class="italic">The Secret of Monkey Island</span> as well as many side-scrolling beats 'em ups:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00172.jpg" class="calibre_86"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Trine</span></span><span class="calibre4"> effectively merges 2D gameplay and physics with 3D assets creating a </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">2.5D</span></span><span class="calibre4"> platformer</span></p><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_117"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Depending on the mechanics and structure of the game you're making, the benefits of using a side view camera can turn into shortcomings. Restricted movement equals somewhat restricted exploration. The surface level can get disproportionately insignificant, meaning a big chunk of navigation will result in either climbing or digging. Some games like Terraria and Spelunky have managed to find ways around the problem with a myriad of navigational tools (ladders, ropes, grappling hooks, jetpacks, and so on), but gravity can often get in the way of your players exploring the environment.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_659"/>


<div id="filepos752019" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Choosing camera settings</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The pitch, field of view, and distance are three key components of any camera. They have to be set and possibly adjusted during gameplay to fit the context and tempo of the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">The default horizontal field of view should be set depending on the predicted distance from the screen and its size. The closer the players are to the screen and the larger it is, the higher the in-game FOV (field of view) can be. This is due to the screen occupying a proportionally broader angle of your actual vision. If we wanted to create a perfect <span class="italic">window</span> into the game world we'd need to match the FOV to the angle between the player's eyes and the borders of the screen, and in most cases, we'd end up with a very narrow view space. Fortunately for us, most players are accustomed to slightly higher FOVs, but we still need to make device and platform specific considerations. For example, first person shooters on consoles operate with a horizontal FOV of around 60-65 degrees as players tend to sit far away from the TV. On PC, on the other hand, players sit much closer and thus the FOV should default to 80-90 (and allow for that setting to be raised even higher). As a result, the PC players will see more of the action to the left and right, but the contents of the screen will seem a bit further away (and perhaps even appear distorted). Moreover, if you were to play a console shooter while sitting close to the screen, you could experience a feeling of <span class="italic">tunnel vision</span> and dizziness, as 90 degrees of your natural field of vision translate to only 60 degrees in the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">On another note, the larger the FOV, the more processing power you'll use on rendering geometry each frame—always something to keep in mind!</p><p class="calibre_70"><img src="images/00170.jpg" class="calibre_87"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">It's helpful to understand the language of camera movement in 3D space</span></p><p class="calibre_5">Most modern action games adjust the camera depending on actions performed by the player. A wide, zoomed out camera helps with fast-paced navigation and split decision making, showcasing a larger portion of geometry and the threats and opportunities around the player. For actions that require precision, such as aiming, an alternative camera setting comes into play, with lower field of view, a closer (zoomed-in) state, and possibly a lowered camera control sensitivity.</p><p class="calibre_5">Horizontal and vertical planes can be easily transferred to the flat planes of our screens, but without VR or stereoscopic 3D technology, depth perception becomes a real challenge. Both of our eyes have to take in the same information, making platforming in third person games a huge challenge. Players can easily misjudge jump distances and have difficulties in aligning themselves with small objects (think of Mario trying to hit a [<span class="italic">?</span>] block suspended in mid-air). To help alleviate that, you can raise your camera and pitch it down towards the ground. This will help in assessing the distance between objects. Just be aware that while a more <span class="italic">top-down</span> perspective can help with horizontal navigation, it lowers the overall vision radius and impedes vertical perception (height).</p><p class="calibre_5">Depth perception matters more up close (especially in melee combat) than it does at a distance, where its significance is reduced. In first person shooters, aiming at erratically moving enemies who are far away is more of a 2D exercise of aligning the aim with the target, and less of an activity involving spatial awareness. Bring the enemy much closer and you’ll realize how much more difficult the combat scenario can get, as players are forced to consider distance and movement speeds in all three dimensions.</p><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_117"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">You need to select the camera perspective based on the game mechanics and distance to action. Do not force an up close camera angle if you require players to be aware of what's happening around them. On the other hand, if you want them to more comfortably engage with targets at great distances, a closer camera can help with aiming.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_5">Once you settle on the distance and field of view, it's important to adjust the framing. The default camera settings should focus the camera on what's most relevant to the player's immediate decision making. If players follow a single avatar, you do not need to make it a centerpiece that obscures the most important parts of the screen. There are better places to showcase your character art, be it menu screens, cutscenes, or even a garage (if your avatar is a vehicle). Focus on what changes the most, that is, the environment and the challenges it poses.</p><p class="calibre_5">Point the camera towards the objective and you'll help guide the players without a single word or a path marker. For this exact reason, in <span class="italic">Super Mario Bros</span>, the camera always starts offset—with the character standing on the left side of the screen, facing right. From the very first moment, the flow of action is natural.</p><p class="calibre_5">In the end, you may find that no single camera setting fits every action and situation in your game. Fortunately, there are several solutions, some of which can be combined:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Put players in control</span>: Allow players to pitch the camera, zoom in and out and maneuver it freely.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Switch between cameras based on context</span>: For example, moving into cover or getting the gun out immediately changes the view for one that suits the scenario. For example, by putting our main character to the side so they do not get in the way of aiming.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Develop environmentally aware camera</span>: This can be complex, but ultimately would let the camera decide on the pitch and distance based on player's surroundings. If the player enters a cramped space, the camera is brought in and behind the character (or even transitions into first person view). If the scene features many ledges and jumps in an open space, the camera is pulled out to show more of the terrain.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Let the level designer adjust the settings</span>: This is a technically simpler, but perhaps more labor-intensive way of handling an environmentally driven camera. A set of camera tools can be provided to the level designer. With these tools, the designer can define unique camera presets and place special areas or in-game triggers, which are invisible to the player and activate different camera settings.</li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_117"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Some of the more advanced, environment and context aware camera features are now being supported by modern game engines. For example, the free Cinemachine plugin for Unity 3D.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_5">No matter what you decide to do, sometimes you'll need to take away the controls and show something that simply cannot be missed. Even wordless cutscenes that simply slide the camera to the object of interest can be invaluable. Adding black <span class="italic">cinematic bars</span> to the top and bottom parts of the screen may seem cheesy, but nowadays, players are predisposed to sit back and enjoy the cutscene the moment they see them.</p><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_117"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Unskippable cutscenes are a cardinal sin, especially if there's no checkpoint/autosave immediately after one. However, accidentally skipping a relevant part of the story is another threat altogether. There are few ways to safeguard against this. First of all, try putting a 2-step confirmation to skip any cutscene, where first input shows a Press [key] to skip cutscene. tip and requires a specific action. Secondly, and especially if you have no 2-step process, make sure that skipping is not possible during the first few seconds of a cutscene; this way input from the gameplay phase won't accidentally skip a cutscene someone's keen to see.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_661"/>


<div id="filepos760857" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Feedback</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Games are interactive systems full of interconnected rules and elements. Clearly communicating the results of interactions and the changing state of the game is what feedback is all about. As a rule of thumb, if the player doesn't realize that things are happening, they might as well not have happened at all.</p><p class="calibre_2">Well incorporated feedback will make your game easier to understand and make for a more satisfying experience. Remember, we're making games, not corporate banking apps; the feedback systems you create can be a source of pure, visceral fun.</p><p class="calibre_5">There's a wide variety of tools to tap into:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">UI feedback</span>: A well-designed interface reacts promptly and clearly to every single input (keystrokes, button presses, tapping, clicking, and so on) as well as to more subtle states such as highlighting objects before input confirmation (for example, cursor hover states, pressing without release). If an action is invalid in the current context, it still deserves a response—either via abstract negative feedback (for example, by using red coloring and <span class="italic">stop sign</span> iconography) or by communicating the failure with an on-screen text prompt (for example, Y<span class="italic">ou can't use weapons within city gates</span>). Explaining <span class="bold">why</span> things don't work can be as useful as providing feedback to successful interactions. Another role of UI feedback is to reflect and highlight any significant changes to the game state. Don't simply update a numerical value from one number to another - many players will completely miss that it happened. Make sure the whole indicator flashes and the numbers pulsate as they go up and down.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Character and object animation</span>: This includes obvious real-world actions such as running, jumping, and opening doors, as well as abstract animations that do not occur in real life. Growing, shrinking, pulsating, moving, rotating, and even re-coloring objects can be done fairly easily in code (without a single frame of animation required). If you can, make good use of these cheap and efficient techniques. For anything else, it'll be down to the use of bespoke, artist-driven animations and...</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Physics</span>: Another way to make objects and characters visibly react and move is to introduce them as objects in your physics engine. A collapsing tree does not need to be animated, it just needs to be detached from the ground and allowed to fall.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Visual effects</span>: Smoke, flames, sparks, light—a bonfire is practically made out of <span class="italic">particle effects</span>, which can either be pre-rendered and exported as flat 2D animations or created dynamically by the game engine. Special effects used in the game-world provide an additional level of feedback and intensity to in-game actions. They are also invaluable in portraying more abstract or immaterial things that cannot be feasibly expressed with physics and animation. You can also use VFX on the UI layer to stylize it and go hand-in-hand with more classic UI feedback. Particle effect editors are not hard to operate and learning their basics can be a helpful skill for almost any game designer!</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Screen effects</span>: Color tints, light flashes, screen shaking, and other full-screen effects are a great way of reflecting important information <span class="italic">(Red overlay?! I'm hurt!)</span> or adding impact <span class="italic">(BOOM! *screen shake*)</span>.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Tactile feedback</span>: By allowing you to physically connect the players to the game world, tactile feedback can make your game much more immersive. Some developers go as far as to integrate the vibration function right into their cutscenes. Nevertheless, vibration is not for everyone and should only be used as an optional, additional source of feedback. Some players find it distracting, while others, especially on mobile, want to limit the noise produced by constant rumbling. When integrating tactile functions, try to limit the intensity and duration of common actions and reserve the stronger, longer responses to fittingly significant occasions.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Audio</span>: The main roles of sound effects are to reinforce the visual feedback of in-game actions and to convey additional information about the game world that cannot be expressed with visual cues (for example, the footsteps of approaching foes). Music, on the other hand, can have a multitude of roles. It can help to set and reinforce the emotional tone of whatever's going on, build an aural scenery of the game world, and even serve as an additional source of feedback. To provide feedback with music, implement a system that adjusts it dynamically to the overall state of the game <span class="italic">(I hear boss fight music, everyone get ready!)</span> or a player's individual perspective <span class="italic">(Oh... combat music? I must've been spotted!)</span>. As useful as sound effects and music are, not everyone can hear them... When it comes to mobile and portable platforms, unless you're working on a music game, you should never depend on audio feedback as the sole way of conveying important information.</li><li value="8" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Textual feedback</span>: While old-school health bars and combat logs (that is, lists of gameplay actions and calculations) can definitely classify as a part of UI feedback, damage and status indicators are often displayed right inside the game world, usually above the actor. If your game contains systems of progression that rely on manipulating numbers, using text to reflect them becomes near-mandatory. This can apply to anything from damage and healing to combo scores and resource production.</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_663"/>


<div id="filepos766987" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Designing UIs</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The main objectives of any UI are to facilitate interaction and communicate the state of the game to the player.</p><p class="calibre_2">Some products can get away with little UI other than game menus and occasional control prompts, while others try to avoid using any text in their interface and operate purely on iconography. The efforts to try and minimize the amount of UI and communicate the state of the game purely with game feedback and UX are applaudable and can result in very elegant designs.</p><p class="calibre_5">Nevertheless, the more complex your game systems get, the more complex the states they produce. Deep and extensive user interfaces are often unavoidable, and knowing how to design them (or at least how to support and understand the professionals that do it for you) is a very important skill.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_665"/>


<div id="filepos768046" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Listing and prioritizing information</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">As game designers, we often strive to provide our audience with deep, complex decisions. We sometimes think that, if players are confused, perhaps showing more of the stuff that's happening behind the hood will help explain the complexities of our systems. Unfortunately, in spite of our intentions, the tendency to show everything can actually impede decision making. This leads to players getting overwhelmed and struggling to focus on what's relevant and what's not. In short:</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Total disclosure can lead to information overload.</span></p><p class="calibre_5">Think of it this way. In a racing game, there's often no need to constantly highlight to the player that they're on the <span class="italic">right way</span>. Instead, we simply opt to display the <span class="italic">wrong way</span> indicator when they're actually going astray. We can extend this principle further by, for example, hiding the health indicators when the health is full. By not providing health information to the player we signal that health has no significance, which means there's nothing to act on or be concerned about (either health must be full or nothing can hurt me now).</p><p class="calibre_5">The more complex your game interface, the more you can benefit from a systematic way of prioritizing information based on context. This applies to both working on your own or with a UI specialist. A potentially complex or novel set of screens and features can easily be broken down, analyzed, and put together by following a three-step process:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Set the primary, secondary, and stretch goals for the interface you're designing.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Define the expected player behavior, possible interactions, and intentions.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Make a list of the potential elements and contents of each screen that fit the goals and enable the expected behavior of your audience.</li></ol><p class="calibre_2">With the goals, intentions, and contents all set, you should be able to map out and categorize each element of the UI based on their role:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Critical</span>: Objects of high relevance, they directly support primary function of the interface and remain important in most contexts. For example, a <span class="bold">heads-up display</span> (<span class="bold">HUD</span>) marker that points towards the location of the mission objective.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Supportive</span>: Any part of UI that (in most contexts) is not crucial to player's ability to interact with the system, but should be readily available to support their decision making and guide the interactions. For example, a minimap or weapon and ammo indicator that can be peeked at and assessed with ease.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Contextual</span>: Information that is only relevant in a particular context is the least important of all and can be hidden behind an additional interaction. For example, a detailed full-screen map is only relevant when we want to plan our next moves or have a hard time navigating with the minimap and the objective markers.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Following such processes can help you design screens that support player behavior and place a manageable amount of information and options in suitable places.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_667"/>


<div id="filepos771764" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">UI mockups</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">In the context of user interface design, a mockup is a prototype version of the interface, created with the purpose of establishing the design direction, demonstrating or documenting the functionality, and validating the usability.</p><p class="calibre_2">A UI mockup is likely to contain no actual art aside from basic geometric shapes, placeholder icons and text labels. Thanks to their simplicity and fast turnarounds, mockups allow for quick iterations on different layouts and ways of surfacing information to the players.</p><p class="calibre_2">Take a look at a simple yet effective wire-frame mockup created by one of SpaceApe's in-house UI and UX experts:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00064.jpg" class="calibre_88"/></p><p class="calibre_2">Following that, we have the in-game version of the very same screen, as seen in <span class="italic">Transformers: Earth Wars</span>:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00025.jpg" class="calibre_89"/></p><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_117"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Try to think of UI mockups as equivalent to the prototypes of game mechanics.

Let's take a look at another example from the same game:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00200.jpg" class="calibre_90"/></p><p class="calibre_2">There's a lot going on in there, especially if you consider that we're designing for a 5-inch screen.

Here's the final version:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00131.jpg" class="calibre_91"/></p><p class="calibre_2">The in-game implementation swaps things around, streamlining and prioritizes the stats and status of the main character. The grid of owned and missing robots takes a backseat. Duplicated or irrelevant information has been removed. The disabled <span class="italic">Rank Up</span> section was replaced by an active call to action. Relevant resource counters have been added. The little blue <span class="italic">eye</span> icon has been replaced by a light textual instruction making the whole combiner a big invisible button that can be pressed to enter the <span class="italic">view</span> mode.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_669"/>

It's common for game and UI designers to use whiteboards or post-it notes to explain their ideas to their colleagues, who'll often carry the design towards a more robust prototype.</p><p class="calibre_2">However, if the design is complicated, highly interactive, dependent on animation, or if you'd like to create a set of many ideas that differ in small details (such as icon size, button placement, and so on), it's best to migrate to a digital medium.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_671"/>

An interactive design speaks more than a thousand words. When it comes to the quality and efficiency of communication, even the most basic prototype is better than a five-page-long description of what the interface is supposed to contain and how it should work.</p><p class="calibre_2">Cloud-based prototyping tools allow you to upload or create your wireframes and link various parts of the screens together and create an interactive flow, which can be sent out and viewed on any device. This is especially useful when designing mobile interfaces and seeking validation on the size of objects and buttons. I've also successfully used these tools to mock-up and present game ideas and even approximate gameplay.</p><p class="calibre_2">It's hard to pinpoint a single solution, as the market for these tools is evolving fast and each has it's pros and cons.

This means that our peripheral vision can acknowledge a 10% change in fill-state as a significantly different situation.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Circular Indicators</span>: Great at efficiently representing time! A circular indicator being filled in a radial manner can result in up to 36 unique positions being easily recognizable by the human eye. Radially filled circular indicators are best reserved for parameters that have clear maximum values such as time, speed, fuel, temperature, pressure, and so on.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Color Grading</span>: Color grading relies on shifting between multiple colors and hues to reflect changing states. Think of water temperature going from blue (cold) to red (hot). Color grading is not very effective on its own and should be used as a supplementary solution (with a counter or a progress bar to provide more precise feedback). Subtle color grading also makes things particularly hard to read for colorblind people. An average human can comfortably register ~5-6 different states between two very distinct colors (red-green) or shades (black-white).</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_679"/>


<div id="filepos780783" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Consider using notification badges</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Colloquially known as <span class="italic">roosters</span>, notification badges are displayed next to buttons, category tabs, items, and so on in order to bring them to your attention. Roosters can help you guide players through multiple levels of menu depth, asking them to take specific action or at least acknowledge the presence of new information. If the number of new objects can get very large and hard to track (like in a standard email inbox) consider using a number in the rooster to help players keep track of changes in areas they're aware of but not fully caught up with:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00067.jpg" class="calibre_92"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Notification badge with number of actionable items</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_681"/>


<div id="filepos781800" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Match the pop-up with the context</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Windows that pop up automatically on top of the screen can be both useful and irritating. There are three distinct types:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">A <span class="italic">modal dialog</span> blocks the players and requires action to progress - it is best used for confirmations of any potentially destructive or time-consuming behaviors. For example, loading the save game (but only while playing), selling high-value items, or traveling to a different map. Such dialog should either come front and center or appear right next to the origin of the prompting interaction.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">A <span class="italic">nonmodal</span> (or <span class="italic">modeless</span>) <span class="italic">dialog</span> can be kept open and acted upon at our convenience. These are usually smaller and tucked away on the side of the screen. They tackle non-essential actions like accepting raid party invites in MMO games and should not interfere with the core gameplay.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">A <span class="italic">Toast notification</span>, a non modal, informational dialog that requires no action—Toasts are used to display brief, auto-expiring notifications such as <span class="italic">Game saved</span> or <span class="italic">Your friend is now online</span>.</li></ol><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_683"/>


<div id="filepos783234" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Understand the limitations of tooltips</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Tooltips are small boxes containing contextually relevant information on the highlighted UI element. They are used widely in PC interfaces (most likely via mouse-over) and any controls that can support a <span class="italic">highlighted but not activated</span> state, a flexible cursor some kind of <span class="italic">selector</span> that can be moved with keys or buttons.</p><p class="calibre_2">Using tooltips on mobile devices can be tricky! Touch interfaces operate best when pressing directly on the objects (tapping and holding on an object is an awkward and unnatural action). Therefore, on touch interfaces, tooltips should not be put on buttons or other elements that have an on-release action assigned to them. You can, however, put them on elements that do not have such interaction, for example, a <span class="italic">metal ore</span> resource indicator can be tapped to show a tooltip explaining the purpose of the resource and your current production rate.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_685"/>


<div id="filepos784390" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Consider labeling your UI</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Text labels appear next to, or on top of, other UI elements such as toggles, bars, buttons, and so on. While an icon of a musical note with a checkbox next to it requires no label (it's obviously a sound ON/OFF toggle), players can easily get lost in the crowded interface full of new functionalities. Text labeling is often essential as even the most descriptive iconography can leave your players guessing. It's important to ensure that any labels you use (be it on or under your UI elements) are ready to be localized (translated) and can adjust their font size accordingly to the available space - what takes 5 characters in English may need 15 in another language. Speaking of languages, we'll dive deeper into localization in the following chapter on accessibility.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_687"/>


<div id="filepos785372" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Do not reinvent the wheel!</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The rules of intuitive control design apply to the user interface. Do not break established paradigms unless you have strong reasons to do so. The potential friction caused by changes that go against player expectations can only be offset with ideas that are either simpler or far superior.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_689"/>


<div id="filepos785874" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Use movement, contrast, and saturation to grab the user's attention</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Our eyes are naturally predisposed to prioritize movement; after all, it can signify a potential threat or prey. A pulsating button will draw attention even if placed in our peripheral vision (should it persist, it can also become really annoying). Another tool you can use is color contrast. Some color pairings are stronger than others; red and green have a stronger effect than blue and yellow, even though both colors are considered strongly contrasting and are placed on the opposite sides of the <span class="italic">color wheel</span>. This could be traced to our ingrown ability to distinguish between ripe and unripe fruit. Differences in color saturation and brightness are more effective if they are used sparsely and consciously. Contrast is a subtle art; if everything is brightly colored, nothing has a chance to stand out. Reserve the contrasting treatment to the critical elements of the UI (going back to the prioritization process described earlier).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_691"/>


<div id="filepos787074" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Request or create a style guide and enforce it</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The person responsible for the visual style of the interface has to develop and maintain a UI style guide. A document that sets the standards for the entire game, starting with the color scheme (including colors behind confirmation, rejection, and neutrality), as well as text and title fonts, the shapes and shading styles of buttons, tabs, text boxes and any other common UI building blocks. A style guide simplifies the day-to-day challenges, ensures the game sends a cohesive message and reduces player confusion. Once the style is set, stick to it. Avoid special cases and exceptions at all costs. If you change something, make sure the change is reflected across the board.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_693"/>


<div id="filepos787985" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Keep theme and pacing in mind</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The style and execution of the UI should reinforce the pace and theme of the game. The subtle UI in <span class="italic">Dead Space—</span> where indicators and menus are holographically projected onto or from the character—fits the slower pacing of an immersive horror game. It also makes menu management a potentially risky move as the game is not paused when navigating various screens. Since all information is embedded right into the game world, players are driven further into it. Even the health indicator is part of the character's suit, blending with it seamlessly until players get hurt in which case it serves as a constant, brightly flashing reminder of the threat they're in. Embedding the UI into the game world is known as a <span class="italic">diagetic interface</span>. It may not be the best fit for you, but it serves as a reminder of how to properly consider theme and pacing as part of the design process!<br class="calibre1"/></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_695"/>


<div id="filepos789098" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Confirm risky actions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">This may sound like a pure formality but you'd be surprised how many games allow you to break valuable objects and lose hours of progress with an accidental click. Confirm anything that has an irreversible (and potentially negative) outcome for the player. You'd be right to be cautious of constant confirmations getting in the way, but you can easily remove them from strictly positive actions. You can also build in a way to opt out of certain confirmations altogether.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_697"/>


<div id="filepos789776" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Count the time and steps to play</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The shorter the play session length, the more important it becomes to get players straight into action. Long title sequences, nested menu options, and confirmations can all get in the way of gameplay. Your players may often have just a few minutes, do all you can to ensure their time is not all spent in menus and loading screens.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_699"/>


<div id="filepos790325" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Screens differ – often widely</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The game interface will often need to support a variety of different devices, aspect ratios, resolutions, and pixel densities. The trend towards responsive design in web development is a good one to adhere to. Objects should not scale endlessly but be capped to a set minimum and maximum size. When it comes to placement, do not use absolute positions, but try to use relative (percentage) distances instead. Anchor all big chunks of the UI to the various parts of the screen (edges, corners, center), then attach all smaller elements (such as buttons inside the pop-up) to their <span class="italic">parent</span> object. A well thought out interface only has to be implemented once, then verified on the minimum and maximum settings.</p><p class="calibre_2">Do not analyze mobile interfaces on computer screens. Use paper sketches or put digital mock ups on small-screened devices and see how they fare against people with relatively large fingers.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_701"/>


<div id="filepos791491" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">UI placement is a science</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">People in western cultures are used to reading content from left to right, top to bottom, in a Z-shaped pattern referred to as the <span class="italic">Gutenberg Principle</span>:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00043.jpg" class="calibre_93"/></p><p class="calibre_5">The <span class="italic">Gutenberg Diagram</span> pictured above divides the reading space into four quadrants and illustrates the Z-shaped reading pattern, as well as the direction of <span class="italic">reading gravity</span>. Which means that as our eyes sweep in horizontal lines, from top to bottom, they tend to get pulled away from the left edge of the screen and more towards the right.</p><p class="calibre_5">While the <span class="italic">Gutenberg Principle</span> finds most use in web-design, its utility can be extended into video game interfaces. It's no coincidence that several years ago, the default interface of <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span> adhered to these rules. Player health was attached to the top-left corner, as it's the most relevant information we need to monitor. Minimap occupied the top-right area. The in-game chat was on the bottom-left, and finally, the combat log sat quietly in the bottom-right. That's because the combat log is only relevant if we consciously seek the information contained in it, otherwise, it remains unnoticeable even though it's constantly scrolling.</p><p class="calibre_5">As screen size gets smaller, a reduced portion of the screen falls into our peripheral vision, reducing the importance of the Z-shaped pattern and placing more emphasis on the center area of the screen. However, the small-screened touch interfaces have a different set of issues. Most importantly, fingers can get into way! This is why status updates and destructive actions (such as deleting something) should be contained to the top, with the bottom part of the screen being dedicated to very popular areas and buttons.</p><p class="calibre_5">According to the research published by UX Matters (<a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php</tt></span></a>), 49% of users use one hand to operate their phone, 36% cradle the phone with their second hand, and 15% use the device with both hands. Let's take a look at a set of heat-maps that help understand the ergonomics of the dominant use-case, that is, a phone held and operated exclusively with the right hand, in portrait orientation:</p><p class="calibre_70"><img src="images/00160.jpg" class="calibre_94"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Credit: UX Matters</span></p><p class="calibre_2">As we can see, the bigger the display, the harder it is to reach across it! Nevertheless, in most cases, the bottom-left quadrant is the easiest part to access, and the top-left one of the hardest.</p><p class="calibre_2">For more information and extensive research on mobile UX, visit <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">https://www.uxmatters.com</tt></span></a> and take a dive into some great articles by Steven Hoober, starting with the three-part article <span class="italic">Design for Fingers, Touch, and People</span>.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">The screenshots used in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only.
