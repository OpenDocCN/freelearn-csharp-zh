<p class="calibre3">The study of <strong class="bold">user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI</strong>) design for <strong class="bold">virtual reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">VR</strong>), <strong class="bold">mixed reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">MR</strong>), and <strong class="bold">augmented reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">AR</strong>) is expansive and ever-growing. It is an emergent technology, and best <a id="_idIndexMarker066" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>practices are not yet fully defined; however, there <a id="_idIndexMarker067" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>are a lot of researchers and developers working <a id="_idIndexMarker068" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>diligently to determine what those best practices are. In this <a id="_idIndexMarker069" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>chapter, I’ll summarize some of the generally agreed-upon <a id="_idIndexMarker070" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>best practices for designing a UI for <strong class="bold">extended reality</strong> (<span><strong class="bold">XR</strong></span><span>) experiences.</span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-40" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor045" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>What are XR, VR, MR, and AR?</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Before we <a id="_idIndexMarker071" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>can begin discussing best practices for VR, MR, and AR, we should clarify the definition of XR, VR, MR, <span>and AR.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">You may notice, if you look ahead on this chapter, that there are no sections titled <em class="italic">Designing UI for XR</em>. That is because XR encompasses VR, MR, and AR! It is an umbrella term. In fact, a more concise title for this chapter could have been <em class="italic">Designing XR UI</em>! XR includes VR, MR, and <span>AR technologies:</span></p>

<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">VR</strong> experiences <a id="_idIndexMarker072" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>are perhaps the easiest to describe. They exist fully in the virtual world. The entire physical world is blocked from view, and the only thing you can see is the virtual space. This type of space can often be so immersive that the brain struggles to distinguish it from reality. Devices that facilitate VR fit over the user’s eyes to completely block out visuals in the real world. Popular devices today that support VR are the Meta (formally Oculus) Quest series, the Sony PlayStation VR series, and the HTC Vive series. Some popular examples of VR games include <em class="italic">Half-Life: Alyx</em> and <span><em class="italic">Beat Saber</em></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">MR</strong> overlays virtual <a id="_idIndexMarker073" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>items in the real world and allows you to interact with them. The user can see the real world and interact with both real-world items and virtual items. MR devices are also worn on the user’s face in the form of glasses and headsets. They either do not fully block out the real world from the user’s view or they allow video passthrough to allow the user to see the real world through lenses. Popular devices today that facilitate MR exercises are the Meta Quest 2 (and above), the Microsoft HoloLens series, and Magic Leap. A popular example of an MR experience is <em class="italic">I Expect You To Die: Home </em><span><em class="italic">Sweet Home</em></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">AR</strong> is similar to <a id="_idIndexMarker074" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>MR in that it combines real and virtual worlds; however, it differs in that the virtual items do not interact with the real world. In AR, virtual items are simply overlaid on the real world and don’t appear within the same space as the real world. Also, it does not enable the user to interact with virtual items in a way that feels like it is happening in their world. AR interactions usually happen on a screen, while MR interactions happen within a physical space. The distinction is subtle, but you can consider AR as interacting with virtual items that appear on a screen while MR is interacting with items that appear as if they are in your space. There are significantly <a id="_idIndexMarker075" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>more AR devices available on the market. Smartphones and tablets are the most popular facilitators of AR; however, some smart glasses also do it. Additionally, there are AR screens, kiosks, and installations that can be found all over the world. Popular examples of AR games include <em class="italic">Pokémon GO</em> <span>and </span><span><em class="italic">Ingress</em></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">There is some nuance to the ideas of XR and their distinctions that I have not fully delved into <a id="_idIndexMarker076" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>in this section. If you would like to learn more, I recommend researching the virtuality <span>continuum: </span><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/virtuality-continuum" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span>https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/virtuality-continuum</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we understand the difference between VR, MR, and AR, let’s look at some best practices for designing UI for <span>these experiences.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-41" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor046" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Designing UI for VR</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Normally, when you think of UI, you think of a <strong class="bold">heads-up display</strong> (<strong class="bold">HUD</strong>)—UI that is on the screen in <a id="_idIndexMarker077" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>front of all gameplay. But in VR, there is no screen in the same sense as there is in games played on a console. The player feels as if they are <a id="_idIndexMarker078" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>fully immersed in the world, and putting <a id="_idIndexMarker079" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>something on the screen they are experiencing a VR game through (the lenses) would result in a fuzzy, unviewable blur since it would be right on top of their eyes. Due to this, VR UI tends to be placed within the world the player will be <span>immersed in.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">In <a href="B18327_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor447" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></span></a>, we will discuss steps around creating UI with a physical representation within <span>the world.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">While there may be some exceptions, there are three locations where a UI in a VR game is <span>usually placed:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14">Embedded within the world in a static position. The player must approach it by moving their avatar toward its <span>virtual location.</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">Embedded within the world a set distance in front of the player’s face. The UI moves with the player and is always in the same relative location regardless of where the player turns their head. Or the player’s avatar does not move in space and the UI also does <span>not move.</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">Attached to the player’s hands—the UI appears as some peripheral device attached to the player’s avatar’s <span>virtual hands/arms.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Which of <a id="_idIndexMarker080" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>the three placements you choose depends <a id="_idIndexMarker081" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>on your game’s design but can also be affected by if and how you want the player to be able to interact with the UI. In essence, you want to make sure the player can see the UI and interact with it (<span>if necessary).</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Let’s start our VR UI design exploration with considerations for designing <span>visual UI.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-42" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor047" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Visual UI placement and considerations</h2>
<p class="calibre3">As I’ve said before, there is not an explicit set of rules for designing VR gameplay experiences <a id="_idIndexMarker082" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>as the technology is still considered emergent and researchers and developers are still learning what those best <span>practices are.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">When creating <a id="_idIndexMarker083" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>a UI that will be a specific distance from the player at all times, it is important to put it in a place that the player can see. Just because a player can see an item doesn’t mean it is comfortable to see it. For example, while a player can see items in their peripheral range, this would not be a comfortable place to put <a id="_idIndexMarker084" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>the UI. The following diagram shows the general angle for a person’s <strong class="bold">field of view</strong> (<strong class="bold">FOV</strong>), where the gray areas are maximum <span>viewing angles:</span></p>
<div class="calibre2">
<div class="img---figure" id="_idContainer038">
<img alt="Figure 3.2: Generalization of the human field of view" src="image/Figure_3.02_B18327.jpg" class="calibre46"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2: Generalization of the human field of view</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">The angles described in the previous diagram are general guidelines and not set in stone. They will change depending on the user’s eyesight, whether or not you want to require them to rotate their eyes (and not their head), and the device you <span>are using.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Keep in mind <a id="_idIndexMarker085" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>that when a player moves their head, the camera moves with it. So, if your UI is placed in a position that encourages them to rotate their <a id="_idIndexMarker086" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>head and is anchored to their head, the UI will move with their head. So, try to place any anchored UI in the area described in <span><em class="italic">Figure 3</em></span><span><em class="italic">.2</em></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">On top of the angle relative to the player’s eye, you must also consider the distance from the player’s eye. If it’s too close or too far, it will cause eye strain. Try to keep any visual UI, especially text that must be read, within 1.3 to 3 in-game meters from the <span>player’s eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">If the player is in a stationary position, creating a static curved UI a set distance away from them always helps the player comfortably move their head around to view <span>the UI.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The last consideration for visual UI I want to discuss is text size. While the recommendation may vary depending on your source, the one I see consistently cited (no pun intended) is that UI should appear a multiple of 2.32 cm tall for every meter away the UI displays. So, if it displays 1 meter away, it should appear 2.32 cm tall. If it displays 2 meters away, it should appear to be 4.64 cm tall. Personally, I have very bad eyesight, and I tend <a id="_idIndexMarker087" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>to make my UI text a bit bigger than this so I can <a id="_idIndexMarker088" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>easily view it. My recommendation is to have multiple people with varying eye strengths play your game and tell you if the UI is comfortable <span>or not.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we’ve reviewed considerations for designing visual UI in VR space, let’s review some considerations for <span>interactable UI.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-43" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor048" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Interactable UI placement and considerations</h2>
<p class="calibre3">Interactable UI is achieved in a few different ways in VR, and it depends on whether the experience <a id="_idIndexMarker089" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>uses a controller or <span>hand tracking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">When using <a id="_idIndexMarker090" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>a controller, here are common ways in which UI can be <span>interacted with:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14">The player simply presses a button to perform an interaction—for example, pressing a menu button to make a menu button appear <span>and disappear.</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">The player selects a UI item with a ray. The player points toward the UI item, a ray appears from their hand, and they then press a button to interact with <span>the item.</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">The player’s avatar virtually approaches a UI item, and the player interacts with it. This includes pressing buttons in virtual space with a virtual hand or grabbing <span>virtual items.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">When using hand tracking, here are common ways in which UI can be <span>interacted with:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14">The player performs some gesture, and a UI interaction is completed. For example, making a thumbs-up gesture could cause a menu to appear <span>or disappear.</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">The player points with their finger at an item, and a ray appears from their finger. They then complete some other gesture to confirm <span>the selection.</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">The player’s avatar virtually approaches a UI item, and the player interacts with it. This includes pressing buttons in virtual space with a virtual hand or grabbing <span>virtual items.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">When interacting with UI via a ray, it is not necessary for the player to physically be able to reach it. But if you want to create UI that the player’s avatar must virtually interact with, you will <a id="_idIndexMarker091" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>need to make sure it is within reach of the player <a id="_idIndexMarker092" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>both horizontally and vertically. Factors for reachability include <span>the following:</span></p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14">Whether the game is played in a stationary mode or if the player is expected to <span>move around</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">Whether the player’s avatar can move around <span>or not</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">The <span>player’s height</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">If players are sitting <span>or standing</span></li>
<li class="calibre14">The player’s general mobility <span>and disabilities</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">A good rule of thumb is to try to make sure players can reach your items by placing them between 0.5 and 0.75 meters from their stationary position. Just as you want to test your visual UI with people with various levels of sight, you will want to test your UI with people of various heights <span>and abilities.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">With both controllers and hand tracking, you want to make sure that whatever interaction you choose is not tiring for the player. Requiring them to perform multiple gestures or hold their hands up for a significant amount of time can cause fatigue and strain that you don’t want to inflict on <span>your player.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">That concludes the major considerations for designing UI for VR that I wish to discuss. However, there is a lot more research and information out there for you to explore! For more information on designing UI for VR, I recommend checking out the resources provided at the end of <span>the chapter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we’ve looked at designing UI for VR, let’s look at designing UI <span>for MR.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-44" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor049" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Designing UI for MR</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Designing UI for MR is extremely similar to designing UI for VR, so most of what I discussed in the previous section translates. However, designing UI for MR does have a few <span>extra caveats.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The main <a id="_idIndexMarker093" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>distinction between designing UI for VR and MR is MR incorporates the player’s physical space and items around them. When playing VR, people generally are assumed to have a wide-open space around them—so that when they flail about recklessly, they don’t hit anything and hurt themselves. The opposite tends to be true with MR experiences—players are generally encouraged <a id="_idIndexMarker094" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>to be around furniture, walls, and other items in their <span>real world.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">The UI being placed virtually not only has to be accessible via the player, but it also cannot intersect with things that exist within their world. You can’t have the player pressing buttons that are inside their desk or viewing screens that are behind their walls. So, when designing UI for an MR experience, you must consider the player’s space and not just the player’s body when placing <span>your UI.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Ways around this include allowing the player to pick where their UI displays, displaying it on top of surfaces that the technology detects (how it is detected is highly dependent on the device the player is using), or attaching it to <span>the player.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">MR is an even more emergent space than VR, especially in the video game field. MR has mostly been used for industrial and medical purposes up to this point and is usually performed in a highly controlled space. MR for a gamer in their home with infinite possibilities of furniture and object placement is still in its infancy and until recently was only achievable in Unity via the Microsoft HoloLens. However, the Meta Quest 2 has added the ability to create MR games in Unity, and Meta Quest 3 plans to have more curated and polished MR support. Additionally, Magic Leap has partnered with Unity to allow for MR development. So, you will likely see more best practices and technology around MR UI in the <span>coming years.</span></p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">For information about developing with Unity and the HoloLens, <span>see </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/unity-development-overview?tabs=arr%2CD365%2Chl2" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/unity-development-overview?tabs=arr%2CD365%2Chl2</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p class="calibre3">Sadly, since MR is such a new and emergent space within the Unity engine, I cannot say much more about designing UI for it. However, AR has been around for quite some time, so let’s explore <span>it now!</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-45" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor050" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Designing UI for AR</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Remember, that what distinguishes AR from MR is AR tends to be on a screen that overlays the <a id="_idIndexMarker097" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>real world, while MR appears more immersed and inside the world. So, interactive items for AR experiences will be displayed on the screen, not within <span>the world.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">Designing <a id="_idIndexMarker098" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>UI for AR is highly dependent on the device that is being used to augment reality. For the sake of clarity, I am going to focus my discussion on AR games developed for cell phones rather than trying to speak universally and include things such as installments <span>and kiosks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">When designing UI for AR app on a mobile or touchscreen, you will want to follow the rules outlined in <a href="B18327_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor024" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>. Best practice is to place most non-augmented digital items (that is, the HUD UI) on the outer edges of the screen. Then, augmented digital items will appear in the middle of the screen. This will cause items that are augment<a id="_idTextAnchor051" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>ing the world to be <span>the focus.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-46" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor052" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Summary</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we discussed some basic design considerations for developing XR experiences. Since the ways in which we experience VR, MR, and AR are all different, we reviewed considerations you should keep in mind when designing for each of these types <span>of experiences.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">XR is still an emergent space, so there are not yet many widely accepted standards. This is particularly true with MR, which just recently began having consumer-available MR devices. However, the information provided in this chapter should help you get started with XR UI design and get you started thinking about how the XR space differs from <span>screen space.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next chapter, we will discuss the concepts of universal design and accessibility and how you can make your user interfaces more inclusive <span>and user-friendly.</span></p>
