    a set of projects in different enterprise environments. Although specific programming
    skills are not mandatory, minimal knowledge is desirable so that you understand
    the code in each example. Some object-oriented programming skills would be helpful,
    but they are not required. This book has been written from scratch, so you'll
    be able to follow any coding necessities step by step.

    will present a brief tour of its history, types, and how it works. We will also
    introduce the **Software Development Kits** (**SDKs**) that we will work with
    in this book. Finally, we will look at examples of the use of AR and, in particular,
    its application inside the enterprise. The main objective of this chapter is to
    understand how AR is being used today, including markets, technologies, devices,
    and development tools with a variety of AR recognition modes, such as target images,
    cloud markers, GPS-based, object or face tracking, and spatial mapping. You will

    visualize part of the real world through the camera of a technological device
    (smartphone, tablet, or AR glasses) with virtual graphical information that''s
    been added by this device. The device adds this virtual information to existing
    physical information. By doing this, tangible physical elements combine with virtual
    elements, thus creating augmented reality in real-time. The following image shows

    creation of AR applications, in which virtual images overlap in the real world.
    It uses video tracking capabilities to calculate the position of the camera and
    the orientation relative to the position of the physical markers in real-time.
    Once the position of the real camera is established, the virtual camera is placed
    at the same point and a virtual layer of information, such as a 3D object, is
    superimposed on the real marker. ARToolKit was originally developed by Hirokazu
    Kato and the initial release was published in 1999 by the HIT Laboratory of the
    University of Washington. It is currently maintained as an open source project
    hosted at SourceForge with commercial licenses available at ARToolworks: [http://www.artoolkitx.org/](http://www.artoolkitx.org/).

    tracking, adding realistic textures to the scenes, and creating multiuser AR experiences.

    a huge improvement on the current state as it will add a new way of interacting
