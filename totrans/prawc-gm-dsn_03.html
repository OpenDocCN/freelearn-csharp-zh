<div><p class="calibre_1">Scoping a Game Project</p><p class="calibre_2">In this chapter, we'll teach you the concepts and relationships between a game's overall scope, its structure, and its content. We'll explore real-world examples and help you build an understanding of how to better document the size, complexity, and dependencies in your game, as well as to help you estimate your tasks.</p><p class="calibre_2">The game's scope is a term used to define the project's perceived size and complexity. Without knowing the scope in advance, any production scheduling, costing, and staffing would be nigh on impossible. The scope is usually well defined by the time you wrap up the first version of the game design document.</p><p class="calibre_2">As a game designer working on establishing the initial scope, it's your responsibility to list all of the game's features, functionalities, and systems, as well as to approximate the entirety of the game's content. This includes the quantity and complexity of gameplay mechanics, playable levels, missions, cutscenes, storylines and dialog, sound effects and music, playable and unplayable characters, weapons, power-ups, items, and so on.</p><p class="calibre_2">Once the project enters production, you're likely to keep using your scoping expertize whenever you work on a new feature proposal or design revision.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">It's always good to make sure your ideas are not too costly or beyond the possibilities of the technology or the team (constraints can channel and boost your creativity) but do not overthink the scope too early! Writing down the scope only makes sense once the structure and core gameplay ideas are well defined.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Beware of feature creep! Sometimes less is more; deciding what to remove is harder but more important than dreaming of new features. The term feature creep is often used when describing scenarios (or even whole projects) in which we attempt to resolve our problems and make the game more compelling by adding more and more features and content, rather than working out the issues living deep within the base game systems and mechanics. Knowing what to keep and what to cut is an essential skill for any game designer. Changes on paper and during prototyping are the easiest and cheapest to make. Don't be afraid to propose cuts early on, as later may end up being too late.</p><p class="calibre_2">After the first drafts of the GDD (game design document) and TDD (technical design document, usually maintained by the lead developer) are finalized, the representatives of various disciplines from your team and studio will be able to estimate the amount of time needed to deliver on the project. This, in turn, allows the producer to create and agree upon the schedule and budget.</p><p class="calibre_2">Since game development is highly unpredictable, you can expect the scope and estimations to be frequently revised and a 20-40% uncertainty buffer added to each estimation (some people go as far as to double their initial estimates).</p><p class="calibre_2">On a side note, it's important to acknowledge that in certain projects you could deal with continuous iteration. This means that your scope will stay relatively undefined and flexible for the duration of the project. Such scenarios are rare, require clear short-and mid-term objectives, and should not become an excuse to generate an unsustainable amount of work for yourself or others. After all, even if time and resources are not an issue, you rarely want to spend ten years on a single game, only to have the entire industry move towards a different direction, distribution platform, and technology.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Game structure</p><p class="calibre_2">To have any chance of scoping and sizing your game accurately, you first need to define its structure. For the purpose of this book, the structure refers to the way different segments of the game all link together and the journey players take during play.</p><p class="calibre_2">With the structure defined, it becomes much easier to divide the game into independent sections and assess the size, complexity, and dependencies of various parts of your game.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">As a designer, you need to decide on the player's journey and the experience you're offering. Do you foresee a single predestined path through your game? Is it branching? Or perhaps you only want to provide the players with various tools and let them take things from there? Is the experience designed to be highly replayable, or is it simply a puzzle to solve or a fixed story to be told and experienced? Answering these questions will tell you a lot about the structure of the game you're making.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">The structure of games not only depends on the desired gameplay experience, but also on the applied business model.</p><p class="calibre_2">Video games might have found popularity in arcades, but they soon made their way into our homesâ€”filling them with dedicated consoles and adding to the reasons for owning a PC. Most games gradually drifted away from high score-driven challenges and sports-like competitions, and towards more defined experiences that told a story or posed a challenge that can be solved, mastered, and exhausted. Limited replay value was not necessarily an outcome of basic game mechanics, but rather of a desire to raise the quality of games, control their difficulty with predefined challenges, and thoroughly utilize all assets and playable content.</p><p class="calibre_2">Finite experiences provided by console and PC titles not only made for more balanced games, they were also perfectly in sync with the available business model:</p><div></div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Buy a new game</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Finish the game</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Buy another game</li></ol><p class="calibre_2">In such a world, having a product with incredibly high replay value might have been used to generate word-of-mouth recommendations, but was not particularly good for long-term business. Nowadays, thanks to a highly competitive market, improved digital delivery methods, and the possibility of monetizing customers repeatedly, we have highly connected games that often offer endlessly replayable experiences, deep multiplayer interactions, and a huge variety of user-generated content. Some argue that games were better in the old days; I'd say they were definitely simpler to produce...</p><p class="calibre_2">There are many ways of dissecting and classifying video games. Many products blur the lines with their expansive game modes and complex structures. Before we delve into some examples, we'll need to take a peek at some of the most common terms and tools used when planning the game's structure, its relationship with content, and the effects of individual decisions on the scope and lifetime of the end product.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Game content</p><p class="calibre_2">In the context of scope and structure, game content refers to games that are designed to be experienced (or consumed). This would include things such as game levels, items, characters, abilities, vehicles, achievements, weapons, missions, and storylines. Since the main gameplay mechanics and rules are the essential foundations upon which everything is built, you generally do not treat them as parts of the game content. Instead, you focus on anything that builds upon your foundations, adds value, and increases the lifetime of your game.</p><p class="calibre_2">In the case of a simple racing title, the content would include all of the tracks, cars, and car parts (including cosmetic items such as paint colors and stickers you can put on your car), as well as the breadth of available game modes (such as time-trial, single-race, tournament, multiplayer head-to-head, and so on). Sounds, music, and the story would also be included, but these components are admittedly less likely to make or break the product. After all, it's safe to assume that many players will quickly lose interest once they master the game mechanics and familiarize themselves with all tracks, cars, and modes, no matter how much story and music we put into the product.</p><p class="calibre_2">A game designer is often faced with important decisions on the relationships between rules and content. Try to look well ahead and predict the areas that might change and expand. Think carefully about the following questions:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Is everything hand-crafted by the development team? Or will you use randomization and/or procedural generation?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Will you expand game content after the game is released? Which parts? How often and to what extent?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Do you plan to use user-generated content? How will you ensure its quality? How will you moderate it?</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">That's a lot to think about, so let's unpack the content-specific terminology and help you answer these questions!</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">Always disclose your intentions within the design specification of each game feature. Let's say you're working on a collection feature. Not knowing that the initial set of 10 collectible items will be later expanded to 100 can have very dangerous consequences. The entire user interface around the feature might need to be remade and the code for creating, storing and displaying these items rewritten. In a sample scenario with only 10 items, your User Interface designer may opt for using large, animated objects, but as soon as that number grows to 100 the inventory becomes hard to navigate and the game's performance suffers and all because the rest of the team were not prepared to support your final intentions. The art assets themselves might even go through an entirely different (and more systemic) pipeline once the aspirations for a large quantity are known. You could even end up using an art outsourcer or automating large parts of the creation and implementation processes!</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Content burn</p><p class="calibre_2">As players interact with your game, they will not only gain mastery over game mechanics and systems, they will also grow more familiar with the contents of your game. Humans love to learn, and good learning opportunities are rewarded with feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction. We easily get excited by anything newâ€”a fresh challenge, an untold story, an undiscovered land. While this part of the human condition leads to our players seeking out and enjoying our games, it also leads to them being bored by repetitive and unchallenging tasks or familiar stories. Boredom is what we try to avoid, and unfortunately for we designers, people are as good at learning as they are at spotting patterns. The same brain that can spot animals in the shapes of clouds, or a human face within a picture of a Martian rock, will be exposed to seeing your gameâ€”often for hours on end. The sole act of exposure to the same set of 3D props and art pieces used to create a seemingly unique dungeon will lead to a feeling of fatigue and boredom. The same fate befalls any content that players interact with repeatedly, including mechanics and systems that do not seem to hold any secrets and potential learning. All of this means that our players don't just enjoy the content of our games, they burn through it, permanently diminishing its value.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Avoiding content furnace</p><p class="calibre_2">The term content furnace is often used when describing games that heavily rely on fresh content to sustain the interest of their players.</p><p class="calibre_2">There's nothing wrong with creating highly focused, hand-crafted stories, but unless you're consciously aiming to deliver an experience with highly limited replay value, you'll have to plan for ways to keep the game seem fresh for longer. There are several ways in which you can limit content burn (or increase the amount of content to burn through) and hopefully keep your players' interest for longer.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Depth and possibility space</p><p class="calibre_2">You have probably heard about some games being described as deep. Depth in this context means that a game has a lot of complex systems and interesting choices hidden beneath the surface. Remember hearing about games that are easy to learn but hard to master? This cliche refers to a perfect-world scenario in which a game is accessible and understandable, yet filled with intricacies that take years of practice and offer near limitless replay value.</p><p class="calibre_2">To create a game with a wide possibility space is to create a game with potentially endless combinations of interesting and unique scenarios to explore. Do games like that exist? Wouldn't they require an enormous amount of content to begin with? The answers are yes and no.</p><p class="calibre_2">Think of classic games such as Chess or Go, these games rely entirely on their elegant rule sets. These rules enable an incredibly deep set of gameplay scenarios that can entertain players for years. There are 20 ways in which you can open up a game of Chess. By the time your opponent responds, the number of possible board states skyrockets to 400â€”each being more or less a valid and meaningful move. These games rely not on supplying new content but on the availability of interesting move sets and challenging opponents to play against (you can play chess against an AI, but it's arguably much less fun without a human opponent). You can say that, through a wide possibility space provided by the rules, these games have avoided becoming a content furnace.</p><p class="calibre_2">Does that translate into modern video games? Yes, it does! At the time of writing of this book, I have amassed over 2,000 hours of playtime in DOTA2, Valve's famous MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena), not to mention several years spent playing League of Legends beforehand. In these games, the level design stays largely fixed. It becomes an unchanging avenue for the moment-to-moment displays of skill, short-term decisions, and long-term strategy. These are games that achieve replayability via deep choices and a wide possibility space, an outcome of:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Interconnected content that creates millions of combinations: <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">A large number of playable characters with unique abilities. Given that these games are played in teams of five, the number of possible team combinations is enormous.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">A large number of items to purchase in-game that can have a meaningful impact on your character's (and your team's) performance.</li></ul></li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Rules and mechanics that test a variety of skills: <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Physical skill tests such as timing, aiming, and reaction times</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Tactics and short-term decision-making, including environmental awareness, item and skill development decisions and enemy movement prediction</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">The long-term strategy, often based on spotting play-patterns and predicting enemy team behavior</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Communication, coordination, and leadership</li></ul></li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">The challenge and satisfaction of playing against human opponents. These games wouldn't be as engaging and popular if they were played against AI opponents. It's incredibly difficult to create effective but seemingly natural AI opponents, and even harder to have them work together and make interesting choices.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">An ever-changing metaâ€”the way in which the game is being played by the community evolves with the game itself. If a certain strategy becomes dominant, the community naturally evolves by learning to expect and counter it.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">I am just scratching the surface of what makes these two games replayable, though now you may be wondering do I need 100 items and 100 characters to create a replayable game? The short answer is no, you don't! The slightly longer answer is, look at games such as Rocket Leagueâ€”a game that could be described as football played with cars. The rules and victory conditions are simple and elegant: get the ball to the enemy goal by hitting it with your car. The amount of content required for this gameplay to work is impressively smallâ€”one arena, one car, a boost pad, and a ball. The game is played in small teams (from 2 to 4 players per team), where each player controls a single car that drives in a familiar way, but players can also jump and steer their car in the air and use a rocket boost to propel themselves. Hit the ball with your car and try to get it to the opponent's goal andâ€¦ that's it! Simple, right? Yet, for many, the replayability is through the roof! The way Rocket League achieved its elusive easy-to-learn, hard-to-master status is all down to the simplicity of the rules paired with the incredibly high skill ceiling of precisely controlling the movements of your car in relation to the ball and each of the surrounding players. It's a highly kinetic game where great timing and team play are absolutely essential.</p><p class="calibre_2">Even though the human factor can hugely help in providing fresh challenges, depth and a wide possibility space are not exclusive to multiplayer arena games. Think of strategy games such as Sid Meier's Civilization and the Total War series, or simulations such as SimCity and Dwarf Fortress. One could argue that even if you removed most of the visual assets and reduced the amount of content, the effect of interactions between the player and the systems powering the game could still provide dozens of hours of fun, filled with interesting decisions and engaging outcomes.</p><p class="calibre_2">Creating deep games is a very difficult craft and can take more time and expertize than crafting heaps of content surrounded by more shallow mechanics. As you increase the number of combinations and possibilities within your core gameplay mechanics, you expose your systems to a range of extreme (and potentially game-breaking) scenarios. Before you add any new rule or feature in the hopes of extending the game's lifespan/depth/complexity, your team will need to make a set of important decisions. Widening the possibility space can (and almost surely will) bring currently unforeseen consequences. Will you have the time to explore these new options? How certain are you that the new addition will be a positive one and make the game more fun to play for longer? Would your time be better spent by simply adding more consumable content to the already working systems?</p><p class="calibre_2">Weâ€™ll delve into ways of creating engaging mechanics and broadening your possibility space in later sections of the book; for now, let's look at other ways of limiting your content burn!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Randomization and procedural generation</p><p class="calibre_2">Randomization and procedural generation are two interconnected terms. While randomization is mainly concerned with the application of chance-based mechanics (think card shuffling, critical hit chance, and randomized loot drops), procedural generation is focused on creating new content based on carefully crafted rules.</p><p class="calibre_2">Letâ€™s focus on looking at the effects of randomization first!</p><p class="calibre_2">To be effective at prolonging your game's lifespan, randomization has to be constrained and applied in a careful, deliberate way. If done right, it can add thrills and make the game slightly less predictable, without undermining the player's ability to plan ahead. Do it badly and you'll end up with an unplayable mess where player actions seem to have little influence over the end result and it's impossible to predict and prepare for what's going to happen next.</p><p class="calibre_2">Anything that becomes randomized is at risk of making the game rules less understandable, as well as breaking the balance of the game (making it either too easy or impossible to win). Moreover, due to negativity bias, most humans pay significantly more attention to negative outcomes of randomization than to positive ones. This means that fully randomized effects can lead to players feeling cheated by the game and losing the sense of agency.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">A fellow designer, Keith Burgun, makes interesting points on randomness that are worth sharing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qfFEP_-LkI"><tt class="calibre5">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qfFEP_-LkI</tt></a>. Keith distinguishes between two types of randomness: input randomness and output randomness. Input randomness is described as one that informs playerâ€™s decisions, for example, map generation. Players cannot affect or predict it in advance, but will able to make decisions based on what they've been served. On the other hand, we have output randomness, which defines the outcome of a player's actions, for example, a die roll that determines whether the action (which you've already committed to) was successful or not. Be very careful when you inject your game with output randomness! The feedback on the player's actions can become confusing and may limit satisfaction from performing good decisions, as well as the opportunity to learn from one's mistakes. A valid move can be met with a failed result, while a mistake on the player's part could yield a positive outcome.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">There are many great examples of using randomization. Some games use it to prolong the lifespan of the game's content; others put it at the heart of their game mechanics. Card games such as Magic The Gathering or Hearthstone would lose most of their appeal if the decks always produced the cards in a predefined sequence. As for Hearthstone itself, the designers have added a wide selection of cards that provide randomized effects after they're played â€“ a great example of using the aforementioned output randomness. It's a polarizing set of cards that can result in both moments of great elevation (Oh my, I got so lucky!), as well as ones of great frustration (This? Really? I quit!). Unless you can provide your players with a clear indication of risk and uncertainty, you should shy away from using output randomness in key areas of the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Another great use of randomization is within reward systems. In games such as World of Warcraft, groups of players would often replay the same dungeon several times in order to get a chance at the desired item. An extreme version of reward randomization is found in a game that uses a Gacha-based (Gacha, from the Japanese word gachapon, refers to capsules sold in vending machines and containing random toys inside) business model. In such games, the most important items in the game that gate player progression are stashed away in randomized loot boxes. It's important to know that not every implementation of gacha rewards is the same (and therefore always fully randomized). A so-called box-gacha refers to a reward set with random chances but no duplicate rewards. Imagine a box with a strictly defined set of 10 items. Even if one of these items has a tiny 0.1% chance of dropping, you can be sure that you'll get the item within 10 tries. The worst case scenario is that you'll need to pull out 9 other items first.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">If you rely on reward randomization, make sure you carefully prepare to handle filler content and duplicate rewardsâ€”there's nothing more demotivating than getting a useless reward or no reward at all. In case of duplicates of unique items, perhaps you can convert them into useful resources? More on this type of rewarding and Gacha-based business model can be found in <a href="index_split_443.html#filepos1012825"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 15</tt></a>, Games As a Service.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">An outstanding example of smartly utilizing randomization can be observed in Valve's 2008 first-person shooter Left 4 Dead. In Left 4 Dead, four players work together across one of several campaigns. A campaign is a predefined string of levels, and each level has a mostly linear path, with a fixed entrance and exit. The game offers just a handful of weapons and items, a few special enemy types, and no differences between characters. On first glance, it does not seem like a hugely replayable game. However, the makers of the game made some very smart design decisionsâ€¦</p><p class="calibre_2">Left 4 Dead features an AI Director. The Director's role is to provide the survivors (players) with a varied and exciting experience that matches the chosen difficulty level. To do that, the director will track a variety of attributes for each player such as health, state, skill level (accuracy, kills, and so on) and position (are they in a group or alone, ahead or behind). Based on this information, the AI Director is capable of making each play-through unique through a variety of gameplay adjustments, the most prominent being:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Spawning hordes of common infected (think fast-moving zombies). The director picks one of the available spawn zones. The quantity and frequency all operate within set limits and are decided by the director.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Spawning special enemies. Types and locations vary and there are limits as to how many special foes can be alive at a time. Some very difficult foes are set to only spawn a set amount of times per map, in one of a few predefined locations, no matter the state of the survivors.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Spawning weapons, health, and ammo in one of several predefined locations. Again, there are upper and lower limits, but if your team is hurt they are much more likely to find life-saving medkits rather than temporary painkillers.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">The Director also takes care of much more subtle features, such as triggering weather effects or dynamic dialogs between survivors (these often refer to their current location or the enemies they face).</p><p class="calibre_2">Since the AI Director plans some elements of the level before the game starts, you could say it dabbles in procedural generation, but the true powers of using procedural generation to create new content go way beyond that!</p><p class="calibre_2">We can delve into the fully procedural worlds of Minecraft and Terraria, as well as No Man's Sky, which not only assembles an entire universe full of planets but also populates it with living creatures! It's important to acknowledge that such extensive procedural generation is an art form in itself, and requires immense technical expertize.</p><p class="calibre_2">On the less extreme (and more controllable) end, we've got the cult action-RPG Diablo, an RPG shooter Borderlands, and countless modern examples of Roguelikes (Enter the Gungeon, Nuclear Throne, and Rogue Legacy to name a few). Looking a bit closer at Diablo, it uses procedural generation to create its special monsters, magical items, and even assemble dungeon layouts, but the designers chose to retain a much higher level of control over the most important aspects of the game. The best gear in Diablo, all of the bosses, the overall story, objectives, and order of dungeons and environments are all handcrafted and pre-planned.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">When designing your game, try to find parts of it that would naturally benefit from randomization and procedural generation, but remember there are tradeoffs! Writing good procedural generation code will take a lot of time (and it will take even longer to test and fine-tune it), and this can have a huge impact on the scope of the game. Moreover, procedurally generated worlds/items/stories rarely feel as special as handcrafted ones. There's a lot you can do by simply randomizing a few elements rather than creating them from scratch. If your game requires a high quantity of content and you need to rely on procedural generation, think of ways in which you can maintain a level of control over the critical parts of it.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">User-generated content</p><p class="calibre_2">Do you want a lot of content but don't want it to come from a soulless algorithm? Encourage your players to create and provide new content for each other!</p><p class="calibre_2">There are many ways in which you can do this. In the past, PC games have often come with a set of map editors and content creation tools some of the best maps in games such as StarCraft and Heroes of Might
and Magic were made by fans. Empowering and supporting an active modding community can also be a valid solution for prolonging your game's lifespan and appeal. However, it can also be very time-consuming and expensive to run, support, and moderate. Therefore, it makes the most sense for big, premium games such as Fallout and Elder Scrolls.</p><p class="calibre_2">Nowadays, the online architecture can enable player generated content to be immediately and seamlessly integrated into the core experience. We've got Super Mario Maker featuring thousands of great maps and the likes of Little Big Planet that let players create and share entirely new types of gameplay experiences that can play nothing like the main game. However, the quality of such free-flowing player creations is often questionable. Without proper moderation tools, as well as ways of promoting quality content, things can go south pretty quickly. As much as you'd want things to run themselves, such features will surely require constant oversight and inflate your game's scope significantly.</p><p class="calibre_2">Maps and mods are great! Unfortunately, not every player wants to spend hours crafting content for others. Fortunately, there are ways in which you could make your players produce high-quality content unintentionally! All you need is to turn that content creation into a significant part of your game. In games like the mobile smash-hit Clash of Clans, player generated maps are used front and center for everything (apart from a relatively short and insignificant single-player campaign). The game has dominated what we now call a build and battle genre, a mix of a real-time strategy and a tower defense game. In these games, players build and upgrade their bases (carefully placing their defenses to protect themselves), recruit troops, and attack other players to take their resources. Incentivizing players to protect their resources drives each and every player to create a new, highly playable map for everyone else. Moderation impact is minimal for the developer, and since players are ranked and match-made against each other, the difficulty is properly maintained.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Managing content treadmill</p><p class="calibre_2">Teams working on live games often have to resort to adding new content in order to maintain their current audience engaged. We sometimes call such situations as being stuck on a content treadmillâ€”if you stop putting out new content, then you run the risk of losing your players.</p><p class="calibre_2">There are many ways of addressing such situations and it's often up to the whole team to come up with solutions of the streamlining production process or lowering the reliance on new content. Still, this is a practical book and we aim to provide some practical ideas, such as:</p><div></div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Remixing: Content does not need to be entirely new to still feel fresh. Mirrored tracks in racing games are a great example. Another one would be using old bosses as late-game enemiesâ€”players only fought them once, why not give them a second life? Recoloring and resizing your assets can also be a very powerful tool!</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Replaying: Systems such as prestige levels (reset your progression in exchange for a token or badge of elite status that can be seen and highly admired by other players) and New Game+ (replay the game at a higher difficulty but keep your progress) are both great ways of giving your players an excuse to keep playing once they reach the end.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Resurfacing: Why not encourage players to play with content they long grew out of? Special objectives and challenges or game modes/custom rule sets can do just that!</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Increasing depth or altering rules: Another way to answer the need for content is to provide more variation outside the content, giving it new life by limiting the repetitiveness of the main game loop. Think of The Arena mode in Hearthstone; it uses exactly the same cards as the main game but allows players to draw randomized cards and create custom decks that always feel fresh and unique. For many players, this mode has prolonged the lifespan of the game greatly!</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Improving your pipeline: Sometimes it's okay to be stuck on a treadmill, as long as you can identify the bottleneck and invest in tools or outsourcing that will make the teamâ€™s life more pleasant.</li></ol><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Common game structures</p><p class="calibre_2">Games are a medium for interaction and storytelling. While both of these elements often go hand in hand, there are times in which the story crafted by the developer and the player's personal story (as told by their actions and experiences) differ widely. Our medium is great at creating interactive systems and letting players loose within them, yet the stories we tell in our games often fall back onto the tropes, conventions, and static structures found in books or movies.</p><p class="calibre_2">While it's possible to implement heavily interactive storylines with dozens of branching paths, and even systems that create and assemble the story procedurally, the same development effort is much better placed with core gameplay mechanics. After all, everyone will interact with gameplay systems, but only a small minority will explore all story branches. This is why in most cases, our games can provide a lot more freedom in their gameplay than in their storytelling.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's look at the possible structures for our games, noting that in many cases, the gameplay and storytelling can either go hand in hand or diverge widely. In cases like that, it's often best to first focus your efforts on the more interactive elements of the game (as they are usually the most difficult to iterate and redesign).</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Linear</p><p class="calibre_2">Linear games are likely the closest our medium can get to traditional, non-interactive media such as books or movies. The experience is pre-planned, carefully paced, and delivered in a fixed sequence, with little room for sweeping decisions or branching paths:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00180.jpg" class="calibre_12"/></p><p class="calibre_70">A simplified portrayal of the player journey in a linear game</p><p class="calibre_2">The biggest and most obvious benefit of making your games linear is having the ultimate level of control over the combined storytelling and gameplay experience. If you know how to exert such control, you can grab your audience and take them through an experience they will never forget.</p><p class="calibre_2">Nowadays, games with a fully linear gameplay and story are hard to find. Even the most restrictive ones often offer a few decision points, alternative solutions, optional paths, multiple endings, and at least a small degree of freedom in approaching the gameplay scenarios. A few examples of games I'd consider very linear (across the years, platforms, and genres) include Super Mario Brothers, Uncharted, Heavy Rain, Portal, and Inside.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">If you're working on a linear game, you'll need to keep the highest standards of quality across the entirety of the game, possibly reworking whole sections of the game repeatedly. In linear games, pacing and balancing are much more controllable, but also even more important. Your players cannot ignore the parts they don't like, or easily distract themselves by doing side missions or exploring other parts of the gameâ€”if you fail to keep their interest (or get them stuck) you put them at great risk of leaving, permanently.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Structured nonlinear</p><p class="calibre_2">Nonlinear games take players off the rails and take advantage of the interactive nature of games - players no longer have to follow a single predefined path from start to finish. In such titles, players are asked to make meaningful choices and have a sense of agency in either gameplay, storyline, or both. However, designers of structured nonlinear games still retain a level of oversight and control over the gameplay experience. They prepare for a series of possible gameplay or storytelling scenarios and prepare the solutions and endings. The final result is a carefully balanced and structured experience that gives a level of freedom to the players, increasing replayability and allowing players to play in a way they enjoy the most:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00167.jpg" class="calibre_13"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Nonlinear games with carefully planned branches, side paths, and multiple endings</p><p class="calibre_2">There are obvious drawbacks and challenges with nonlinear games. The alternative paths should be as fun and rewarding as the main one, as the moment you encourage certain play styles is the moment you take away the choice and force many players to play the game in the optimal (but potentially less fun) way. Your scope will also grow substantially, especially if hand-crafted stories branch in multiple directions. You'll also create a lot of potentially time-consuming content that most players will never explore, so take that into consideration if you plan to put the coolest bits of the game behind an unlikely branch.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">It's much more manageable to provide a level of expression in your gameplay while keeping the story going in a roughly similar direction. You can then rely on the player's play style and choices, and reflect them either at the end of the game or throughout it (but not in a way that derails the main branch of the story).</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">In games such as Hitman, Thief, Deus Ex, or Dark Souls, players are presented with a great degree of freedom in the way they approach gameplay situations, but ultimately the structure follows an order that can be predicted and planned for.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Open nonlinear</p><p class="calibre_2">Some nonlinear games open up their structure and let the players loose. They provide a very wide possibility space and make it nearly impossible to predict how the player will reach the end. Such titles still come with a defined set of winning and losing states, and often a carefully crafted main storyline, but any attempts at plotting the player journey are futile.</p><p class="calibre_2">In such games, players are set free to roam and explore the content and gameplay systems, making each playthrough unique. Some series, such as Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Just Cause, or Grand Theft Auto, do it by providing an open world and filling it full of optional activities and missions that can immerse their players for hundreds of hours. Others, such as Civilization and the Total War series, make their players miss on sleep by offering deep, interconnected systems and simulations with countless moving parts. Another worthy example would be the interactive fiction 80 Days, which is a unique take on an open nonlinear game with amazing, highly adaptive storytelling and a definite ending:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00179.jpg" class="calibre_14"/></p><p class="calibre_70">A game with a defined beginning and ending, but a wide and unpredictable possibility space</p><p class="calibre_2">There are no absolutes in game design; it's perfectly possible to retain a level of control over the structure and story of the game, while still allowing for free-form exploration. Most open-world games assume a hybrid form. They do not want players to be overwhelmed or venture too far too soon. In order to do that, you can create a set of artificial requirements that players have to meet in order to access an additional portion of the game. This unlock mechanism will let you pace the experience better and let your players focus on a more manageable amount of content:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00027.jpg" class="calibre_15"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Rather than opening your structure fully, you can divide the game into a series of hubs with players progressing through them in a controllable manner</p><p class="calibre_2">The scope implications of an open world game can be huge, making tools for content creation and testing of paramount importance. You'll need to create a lot of content to make the world feel interesting, often with a risk of having to throw it all away as you modify and polish your gameplay mechanics. And as always, without solid second-to-second gameplay, no amount of content will save your game!</p><p class="calibre_2">Thereâ€™s always an option of going after a wide possibility space through the depth of gameplay. In such case, you'll require countless hours of prototyping, playtesting, and bug fixing to ensure the system is fun and performing as intended. Deep systems and simulations can be very hard to create and especially hard to balance, as a single change can have unforeseen repercussions across the entire long-term playthrough.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Endless and sandbox</p><p class="calibre_2">Some games do not have a defined end or victory state and can be considered endless. This does not stop at the endless runner genre (very popular a few years ago, and includes the likes of Temple Run, Subway Surfers, and Despicable Me: Minion Rush). There are multiplayer games such as World of Warcraft, The Sims, or Clash of Clans that have a finite amount of content but never really end. In these games, you can win a battle, but you can never end the war...</p><p class="calibre_2">Sandbox games are not only endless, they are also mostly devoid of goals. Many designers argued that due to its endless and directionless nature, Minecraft is a toy and not a game (that was before Minecraft added some structure and goals via adventure mode).</p><p class="calibre_2">It's easy to mistake games that support sandbox play, such as Grand Theft Auto or Fallout, for sandbox games. It's true that GTA allows a huge degree of freedom and supports undirected, exploratory play, but there is always a storyline, progression gates, and a potential victory state. Even if players are free to choose their path, they are often confined and locked in certain states by the game's story. A true sandbox game is free-form and often endless; it's a vehicle for player expression, a virtual world, a simulation to get lost in. This structure rose to popularity with games such as Terraria, DayZ, and Rust (and of course Minecraft) selling millions of copies:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00136.jpg" class="calibre_16"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Uhâ€¦ Plotting a player journey? Oh well... There might be progression milestones and technology trees, but you can't really predict what your players will do next</p><p class="calibre_2">Sandbox games are not easy to create and even harder to test. However, by adding multiplayer features, one can get away with a seemingly shallow game as long as players can express and entertain themselves by interacting with each other. Just make sure there's something to work towards, to aspire toâ€”a fantasy that players can spend long hours trying to fulfill.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Notes on structure</p><p class="calibre_2">As with any classification, the reality is often putting things on a sliding scale, and one product can have game modes or chapters that belong to wildly different categories. It's also possible for players to completely ignore the structure, step outside the path we laid out, and even make up their own goals. For example, some players in GTA 5 may completely ignore the tight sequence of story missions concerning the main characters, and instead explore the world, set records in longest car jumps, and try to attract as much police attention as possible and get away with it.</p><p class="calibre_2">Settling for a particular style of game structure within any part of your game is an important part of the design process. You need to consider:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Do you have the expertize required to pull off this type of experience? Opening up the possibilities comes with risks and can multiply your budget.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Do you know from the outset what kind of game you're making and what kind of play styles will you support?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Is there a set of expectations to be met on the structure of the game? These can be internal (team) or external (your audience).</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Scoping practices</p><p class="calibre_2">The best way to approach scoping is by deconstructing the game from the top and defining the critical progression path of the player. Think of the final experience you want to deliver or the story you want to tell. Thinking about levels or any other units of player progress, can you define the minimal, optimal, and nice to have quantities? How much new content (obstacles, NPCs, game mechanics, and so on) you'll need on each part of the critical path to keep things interesting? By dividing player experience into chunks, you'll be able to easily estimate the amount of all interdependent elements.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Content lifespan</p><p class="calibre_2">The content lifespan is a document that lists every significant piece of content and maps it against a player's journey in the game. It allows people to plan the production, estimate which elements are needed first, and identify the areas that have too many or too few new elements.</p><p class="calibre_2">Unless you're working on a very open-ended game or a sandbox experience, it should be possible to define a player's vector of progression. This vector will serve as the reference point in the lifespan document. To give a couple of examples: in an open world RPG, the vector of progression might be the player's experience level; in a linear puzzle-platformer, it would be the stages themselves; and in an adventure game, it could all come down to the place in the storyline.</p><p class="calibre_2">Content lifespan documentation can be used to:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Examine the progression path: If you're focusing on improving the first hour of the game, you'll want to focus your efforts on only the relevant parts</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Pace the end-user experience: It's arguably the easiest way of ensuring that fresh content and game mechanics are properly spread out</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Plan content deliveries: You always want artists and programmers to work on things that you'll need next</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Identify dependencies: No need to work on that new power-up if the gameplay mechanics for it are half a year away!</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Real-world examples</p><p class="calibre_2">Normally, my content lifespan document would take the form of a long table with a single row for each element in the game (it would include buildings, obstacles, playable and non-playable characters, interactive objects, cutscenes, weapons, abilities, scenery, level design, and so on). I'd then add columns that contained the following: a short description, the first time an element is used, priority, and dependency (an obstacle that requires a special gadget obviously has to be created after said gadget).</p><p class="calibre_2">Games have differing structures and their relationship with content varies wildly, therefore every game should be approached in a fitting way.</p><p class="calibre_2">In Transformers: Earth Wars, we already had an art production spreadsheet and lists of robots and buildings; there was little point in listing all of the assets again. Therefore, I opted for a simplified graph followed by a more complex and integrated progression matrix, which I'll demonstrate further on.</p><p class="calibre_2">The game is a mobile, multiplayer, build and battle title. For the critical vector of progression, I chose the most important building, the player's Command Center. Unlike the player's robot collection (which is the most important thing in the game, but can vary wildly), buildings follow a linear path and are strictly tied to the Command Center Level. Upgrading the CC becomes a big investment in the base and is a visible milestone. Treating it as a main vector of progression also meant we assigned and locked all of the game features and technologies directly to it.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Player progression flow</p><p class="calibre_2">First, I mapped known features and milestones in the game against Command Center levels. This diagram has been created as a drawing inside our game design document (the GDD itself was a Google Docs text file). Once we were happy with it, I printed several copies, stuck one of them on the wall and gave out the rest to the people responsible for planning the production (producer and art director), as well as to every single programmer on the team.</p><p class="calibre_2">Interestingly enough, we all knew that the game would go beyond Command Center 11 (we actually made data for 16 CC levels and held some back, releasing the first 14 on game launch), but we also knew no new features would be locked by or planned for that late in:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00074.jpg" class="calibre_17"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Simplified player progression flow allows to plan feature delivery and control the added complexity, ensuring we don't overwhelm our audience</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Unlock matrix</p><p class="calibre_2">Following the progression map, the unlock matrix was created; this table was also printed and handed out around the office. It may look a bit confusing and hard to read, but that's because it wasn't just a reference point. It also served a much bigger purposeâ€¦</p><p class="calibre_2">We've integrated the unlock matrix into our economy spreadsheets. Through multiple lookup and match formulas, we have ended up with a single sheet that directly amended and influenced game data for our entire economy. Making changes in the unlock matrix would result in corrected resource costs, building times, and unlock requirements being filled in automatically for all the other sheets such an approach makes it much easier to balance and refactor player progression (more tips on how to set things up can be found in the balancing chapter of the book).</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00196.jpg" class="calibre_18"/></p><p class="calibre_70">The first part of the matrix lists the maximum number of buildings you can build per type</p><p class="calibre_2">Anything going from 0 to 1 in the matrix given in the preceding screenshot signifies a new type of building being unlocked. The data looks a bit hard to read but can be processed by spreadsheet formulas with ease. You can look at the flow as well as each CC level individually. For example, I was able to add a column to the footprint of each building and use it to calculate the size of the building required to fit the base. This was of tremendous help when trying to figure out how many removable obstacles (rocks, trees and so on) should be placed on the map:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00141.jpg" class="calibre_19"/></p><p class="calibre_70">The second part of the matrix shows maximum upgrade level per CC level</p><p class="calibre_2">When it comes to upgrade levels, most defenses and production buildings simply increase by 1 for each Command Center level. But that's not the case for everything; things like the Workshop (a research center that restricts the maximum experience level for your bots) and Attack Shuttle (controlling the total number of robots you can deploy in battle) are very carefully crafted.</p><p class="calibre_2">On a side note, the confusing pink numbers were added when I was implementing the 3D models for buildings. We've only created six visually different versions of each building (apart from walls, as combined they leave a very large visual footprint on the base). So to make my life easier, I put the visually different levels in pink to help in data input. I made sure there's always a visual upgrade from level 1 to 2 (the first time you upgrade something), but I also made sure we don't use up all of the building upgrades too early (some upgrades for the most advanced buildings were left for the future).</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">I might have gone into quite a lot of potentially unnecessary detail here, but there is an important lesson to take away from the process. As a designer, you need to define the kinds of data you want to control and adjust, and this can be difficult if you're breaking new ground. Once you have defined your parameters, use spreadsheets, graphs, post-it notesâ€”anything that will help you visualize and operate on the data from a new angle.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Game flow</p><p class="calibre_2">Flow charts and diagrams are a very powerful tool that every designer has to learn to utilize. They can be used for anything from explaining the ins and outs of your game economy and gameplay mechanics, to portraying technology and skill trees.</p><p class="calibre_2">Unless your game is trivially simple (or a near-direct copy of something existing), you'll need to create a flowchart of sorts to explain where various options and features fit in and how they are connected. Even a simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors could have its flow represented by a chart:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00193.jpg" class="calibre_20"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Flowchart for a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors with multiple rounds.</p><p class="calibre_2">In the preceding example, we can see the structure of play as well as some of the rules that decide the outcome of a round. For those not familiar with the symbology:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Rounded squares represent terminal blocks (beginnings and ends of processes)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">A parallelogram is used for user input/output</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Diamonds portray decisions. Use these for simple yes/no or true/false forks</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Rectangles are used for processes and operations</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Arrow connectors are used to join parts of the diagram and portray the direction of transitions</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">On-page connectors (the circles with letters inside) allow us to avoid long and confusing arrows by connecting two remote parts of the flow</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">It may be a lot to take in, but for experienced people, reading such diagrams is much easier than reading paper rulesets.</p><p class="calibre_2">Nevertheless, do not overthink the flow diagramsâ€”we're not creating blueprints of factory processes, we're making games! It doesn't matter how many different shapes and connectors you use. As long as you do not confuse people, you can opt for a set of simple arrows and boxes.</p><p class="calibre_2">Going to the lengths of putting a rhomboid decision box with forking outcomes for every single thing will likely end up as a waste of your time and potentially overwhelm the rest of your team (no one wants to read a flow with hundreds of nodes).</p><p class="calibre_2">Ultimately, the game flow will evolve and change over time; the purpose of the initial diagrams is to help you visualize the structure of the gameâ€”do it by whatever means necessary. You can inject screenshots from reference games or earlier prototypes, comments, wireframes (rough sketches of the user interface and content)â€”everything flies as long as it helps you communicate effectively. If you really need a diamond decision box with forking pathsâ€”use it! But, if you're going to write up a detailed explanation of that part of the game anyway (with potentially its very own flow chart), opt for simplicity and put it all in a simple box.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">These days, you rarely need to install specialist software such as Microsoft Visio or Inkscape. There are countless online solutions such as draw.io or Lucidchart, and you can always fall back on something even simpler; unless you're doing something large and complex, Google Slides and Powerpoint can easily satisfy most of your needs. Some people even use pictures of whiteboards or post-it notes.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Example of a menu flow</p><p class="calibre_2">As an example, I choose to create a simple menu flow for the PC version of Blizzard's digital card game Hearthstone. A few details about the game were simplified (in order to fit it on a single page), but it should still prove as a useful example!</p><p class="calibre_2">Instead of using a conservative flow diagram iconography, I've opted for a very loose and accessible approach. Each area of the game is portrayed by a rectangle that explains available options.</p><p class="calibre_2">Even a simplified menu flow like that, combined with the information contained in the GDD, paints a good picture of how the game can be put together, helping the whole team see the connections between the different areas of the game and empowering user interface artists to start working on wireframes, visualization of various options, and polishing the end-user experience:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00023.jpg" class="calibre_21"/></p><p class="calibre_2">Bear in mind that in modern, collaborative teams, any flows and documents you create are not supposed to be a final directive of how the game will be made. Instead, treat them as a great way to present your vision, a solid starting point that enables the team to spot flaws early on and allows for a more informed discussion to take place. Do not over-explain too early and be prepared to edit and re-work everything. Again, the more changes you make on paper, the better and more efficient your team can be!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Planning design work</p><p class="calibre_2">In the games industry, it's usually the project manager who creates and enforces production schedules. To do that, a list of task and assets to produce is assembled based on the design documentation. These tasks are then paired with estimates that (in the best-case scenario) come from the people who will actually end up doing said tasks. If the project is highly inventive and/or staff members inexperienced, more senior employees might get involved in helping with the initial schedule.</p><p class="calibre_2">Unfortunately, in the words of strategist Helmuth von Moltke, "No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy." First production schedules are likely to be very, very wrong. In the beginning, things will usually take longer than anticipated, and a lot of unknown problems, changes in direction, and missed tasks will emerge. Fortunately, as time goes on, your team's experience with the product grows and your tools are likely to improve, making the creation of future game content much quicker than initially anticipated. Good development studios and publishers acknowledge that games are very hard to plan accurately, and are prepared to be reasonably flexible.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">In Agile game development, you're likely to encounter different levels of detail when it comes to planning and task preparation. Long-term plans tend to be loose and based on rough estimations; the game might have a shipping date from the beginning, but it's very unlikely to be the actual one. Mid-term plans (next few months), usually focus on clear goals that the team is striving to achieve for example: getting the first level playable, finishing the character customization system, testing network code. Short-term plans (next two sprints, that is, development cycles) are the most detailed and least likely to change, as they contain lists of detailed tasks, order by priority, which is either worked on right now or will be assessed for inclusion in the next development cycle.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">No matter how fragile and changeable, plans need to be made right before the game can enter the production period. As a representative (or at least a valued member) of the design team, you're likely to be involved in the process. While deliverable tasks for artists (such as character models, animations, environments, and so on) are relatively easy to put into numbers and estimate, design tasks tend to be much more elusive. We'll cover some tips that might help you in tackling this problem!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Estimation techniques</p><p class="calibre_2">Estimating the entire project upfront can be a daunting task, but there's a technique you can use when faced with any big problem - break it down into many small problems!</p><p class="calibre_2">Your first step would be to look at a list of all features and pieces of content. Think of any design tasks that could go on that list. For example, if you're working on a first-person shooter, you'd not treat level design, weapon design, and enemy design as just three huge tasks; instead, weapon design could be broken down and estimated as a set of smaller, more manageable tasks:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">High-level design of all weapons (quantity, when are they unlocked): 2 days</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Design and implementation tasks for each weapon: 3-4 days (per weapon) <ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Ideation and prototyping (desired role and feel): 4 hours</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Art brief and references: 1 hour</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Initial gameplay implementation: 2-4 hours</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Initial balancing pass: 2-3 hours</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Art implementation and sound brief: 2-4 hours</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Playtesting and polishing time: 6-8 hours</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">Bug fixing: 2-8 hours</li></ul></li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Playtesting for all weapons: 5 days</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Final balancing of all weapons: 3 days</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Final polish pass for all weapons: 5 days</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Once you break things down, look at the combined time taken and see if there are any obvious mishaps, then add some contingency budget (usually at least 20%) and make sure to revisit and re-estimate the tasks in the future, based on acquired experience.</p><p class="calibre_2">You'd be surprised how effective such breakdowns can be, especially if you approach the unknown quantities in the same way as the famous nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi...</p><p class="calibre_2">Fermi was known for his ability to make very good approximate calculations with very little to no actual data. Instead, he relied on making justified guesses in which he replaced any unknown quantities with averages of possible lower and upper values. How does that translate into practice? A famous example of a Fermi problem is How many piano tuners are there in Chicago? In order to answer that question, we'd break the problem down into smaller chunks asking following questions:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">How many people live in Chicago? Let's say we have no idea, but we know it's a big city, more than 4 million but less than 15 million. An average of these two values would be 9.5 million.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">How many people are in each household on average? Surely more than 1, but probably less than 3. Let's take 2.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">How many households have a piano that requires regular tuning? Probably more than it 1 in 35, but less than 1 in 5. Let's say it's 1 in 20!</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">We can also guess that regularly tuned pianos need around once a year.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">How long does it take to travel to the customer and tune a piano? More than an hour, but probably less than 4. Shall we say 2.5?</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Each tuner works 8 hours a day, five days a week. 50 weeks in a year.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">With these assumptions we can do the following calculation:</p><p class="calibre_2">(9,500,000 people in Chicago) Ã· (2 persons/household) Ã— (1 piano/20 households) Ã— (1 piano tuning a year) = 237,500 piano tuning tasks every year in Chicago.</p><p class="calibre_2">Now, how many piano tunings can a tuner perform in a year?</p><p class="calibre_2">(50 weeks/year) Ã— (5 days/week) Ã— (8 hours/day) Ã· (2.5 hours to tune a piano) = 800 piano tunings per year.</p><p class="calibre_2">Now for the final calculation!<br class="calibre1"/>
(237,500 piano tunings per year in Chicago) Ã· (800 piano tunings per year for each piano tuner) = 297 piano tuners in Chicago.</p><pre>However, there's another more important reason. Have you ever played through an expansion pack or a piece of post-release downloadable content, which felt much better than the base game? As with many things in life, practice makes perfect!</pre><p class="calibre_2">Your best work on nearly any game is the work you'll do last, built upon the breadth of experience with the product. The middle of the game is very much such as the middle of a book or a movie, no matter how good it is, if the beginning is bad no one will reach it, and if the ending sucks, that's the only thing they'll remember. Almost all games benefit from starting the development partway through the player journey, no matter how annoying it is to not have the game playable from the start for a long period of time. If you're to create a platform game with 10 stages, start on level 3 or 4, followed by more work on the middle chunk, then do the start and finally the end.</p><p class="calibre_2">If for some reason you cannot start in the middle (say you want to do play-testing of core mechanics), make sure to set aside some time to revisit, iterate, and potentially rebuild the initial areas later on.</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember, the very same technique of starting in the middle works on any scale and applies to individual features. For example, you're working on multiple campaigns, but you must deliver them in order, perhaps you can start each campaign in the middle? What also helps is the extra frame of reference that you gain as you start in the middle. It's more convenient to aim for medium difficulty level, then dial it up and down as needed, than to start easy and keep escalating up.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">The screenshots used in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only.

By now, you should have a better idea of how to analyze the structure of games and better predict their scope. We spoke at length about game content and your role in helping to define it. We've accustomed ourselves to the content treadmill (and how it can be avoided), and looked at the differences between games that rely on the content burn and those that aim to deliver a deep possibility space. We've also analyzed popular game structures and explored ways in which you can document the scope and plan of your work.</p><p class="calibre_2">Armed with all this knowledge, we should be ready for the part you're anticipating (or dreading) the most. It's time to delve deep into the art and craft of writing design documentation!</p><div></body></html>
