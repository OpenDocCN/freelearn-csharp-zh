			<p>In our rapidly evolving world, driven by digital transformation, solution architects are the most significant experts with a particular skill set and a wide range of technical expertise for balancing business needs with technology solutions. The purpose of this book is to give you a broad understanding of .NET solution architecture with a hands-on approach to help you become an effective solution architect.</p>
			<p>The book covers the principles of the <strong class="bold">software development life cycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>), the roles and responsibilities of a .NET solution architect, and what makes a great .NET solution architect. As you progress through the chapters, you'll gain an understanding of the key principles of solution architecture and how to design a solution and explore designing layers and microservices.</p>
			<p>You'll complete your learning journey by uncovering modern architecture patterns and techniques for designing and building digital solutions.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you'll have learned how to architect your modern web solutions with ASP.NET Core and Microsoft Azure, and be ready to automate your development life cycle with Azure DevOps.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for intermediate and advanced .NET developers and software engineers who want to advance their careers and expand their knowledge of solution architecture and design principles.
