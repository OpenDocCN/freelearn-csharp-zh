			<p>In the previous chapter, we highlighted the importance of the different roles within a software development team. We also explored some key attributes to support you in assembling a powerful and successful team. <em class="italic">Why do you need to learn this?</em> Because you might hire the best candidates out there, but if you don't have a proper culture in place, and if the team members are not able to communicate with each other efficiently, you could end up losing the project or your client.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will primarily focus on the solution architect role. Additionally, we will elaborate on a set of personality traits that should empower you to lead effectively in today's digital world.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An overview of solution architecture</li>
				<li>Exploring the fundamental soft skills that every solution architect should have</li>
				<li>Getting to know some common pitfalls that should be avoided</li>
				<li>Learning the difference between an enterprise architect, a technical architect, and a solution architect</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have an overview of what solution architecture is. Additionally, you will get to know core personality traits that you should acquire as a solution architect to empower your architectural thinking and leadership skills.</p>
			<p>These personality traits are essential in order to become successful because the solution architect role has to deal with many aspects that are not technical, such as team building, negotiating with clients, resolving conflicts, improving business processes, and creating a culture of innovation and professionalism within the team.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>What is solution architecture?</h1>
			<p>Before we <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>dig deep into the personality traits of the solution architect, first, let's get to know what solution architecture is. <strong class="bold">Solution architecture</strong> is a set of activities that aims to explore and analyze a business problem based on predefined requirements and create an architecture design for the proposed technology solution that fits with the client's goals and needs. </p>
			<p>Typically, the solution architect <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>should consider the following four key factors and related constraints when creating a balanced and effective solution and its architecture design:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enterprise constraints</strong>: Identify the enterprise constraints and goals behind building the product.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stakeholders' perspective</strong>: Understand and analyze the requirements collected from the business stakeholders and power users.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technology value</strong>: Identify the value of the technology stack and components used in your solution that should comply with the enterprise strategic guidelines and best practices.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project constraints</strong>: The solution architect should consider the project timeline and budget.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here is an illustration that summarizes the different constraints that should be considered in your solution design:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B17366_03_01.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1: An ideal solution should consider these constraints"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1: An ideal solution should consider these constraints</p>
			<p><em class="italic">So far, it looks pretty simple, right?</em> Solution architecture is the process of designing and managing the whole solution engineering, which is expected to solve a business problem by <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>executing a list of practices. This should be accomplished by the solution architect before starting any development activity, and we will examine this in more detail later in this book.</p>
			<p>Now, let's dive into some of the essential personality traits that a solution architect should have.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Exploring the personality traits and skills of an effective architect</h1>
			<p>Being an <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>effective solution architect can be both challenging and game-changing in today's rapidly changing and disruptive business world.</p>
			<p>In this section, we'll take a look at some of the most important personality traits, soft skills, and qualities that are needed to become an efficient, practical, and business value-focused solution architect who can make a difference within a company.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Leading by example</h2>
			<p>Solution architects are <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>responsible for <em class="italic">leading</em> all the architecture activities of a solution or a product. They should set the right direction for the team, enforce an innovative culture, and build an inspiring vision. One of the leadership skills that you should prove as a solution architect is to lead by exampleâ€”<em class="italic">walk the talk</em>. <em class="italic">So, what does that mean exactly?</em> Let's imagine the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There is the leader who asks people to stay late at work to solve problems but then leaves on time.</li>
				<li>There are the managers who request that you reduce the amount of money spent on improving hardware or hiring new team members, but then buy themselves luxury office furniture.</li>
				<li>There's a supervisor who asks his team to use their time wisely to be more productive but is then found to be spending a long time on social media during working hours. </li>
			</ul>
			<p><em class="italic">Have you ever heard of these types of leaders?</em></p>
			<p>For great leaders, actions speak louder than words. Nothing will kill the enthusiasm or motivation of a team faster than watching an incompetent leader say one thing and then do the opposite. It can be very disappointing, and it leads to low morale, which can be destructive for a team. </p>
			<p>As a solution architect, you must know that you have a responsibility toward your team. They are closely watching every move you make because they are looking for guidance. You have to inspire them and push them to get the best outcome. The proper way to do this is by being a good example. Your actions must be consistent with what you say.</p>
			<p>Here are some <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>ways that you can use to lead by example and win the trust of your team:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Get your hands dirty and take responsibility by supporting your team during difficult times. Don't just sit back and tell them what to do.</li>
				<li>Always apply the rules and standards that you set so that your team can follow you.</li>
				<li>Empathy is essential; be emotionally sensitive to the feelings of your team members.</li>
				<li>Take the time to make each individual feel special and important in front of the rest of the team and the entire organization.</li>
				<li>Treat your team members the way you would like to be treated.</li>
				<li>Not all team members are similar; challenge yourself to know them better, accept them for who they are, and respect their unique differences.</li>
				<li>Listen to criticism because, sometimes, it can be constructive. Avoid being defensive when you do so.</li>
				<li>Interpersonal conflicts in the workplace can happen; you cannot avoid them. However, make sure you resolve them as quickly as possible.</li>
				<li>Never take people for granted.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you walk the talk, you lead by showing your team members how to do things the right way, that is, you set a good example for them. In this way, you become a more effective leader.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Displaying outstanding communication skills</h2>
			<p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>key competencies of a solution architect is having good communication skills, which are essential for building relationships. Remember that your role obliges you to negotiate with clients and resolve any conflicts with the team members. You must be a good listener, not only to respond but to also properly understand the needs of all parties. A lack of communication skills can create a serious bottleneck. However, on the contrary, being able to communicate effectively is a key factor in the success of a project and, therefore, the success of the solution architect. </p>
			<p>Here are <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>some tips that you can use in your daily interactions with your team members to achieve effective communication:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Show empathy because it creates mutual understanding and trust.</li>
				<li>Give compliments to your team members, particularly during difficult discussions. Statements such as <em class="italic">I think what you are saying is great</em>, <em class="italic">I agree with you</em>, and <em class="italic">you did great work so far</em> will boost their motivation and improve the morale of the team.</li>
				<li>Not all people will have the same opinion as you; be willing to respect the other person's opinion, and don't be rude or arrogant.</li>
				<li>Eye contact is important because it improves the quality of communication and most people consider it as a sign of trustworthiness. Try to look the other person in the eyes while having conversations.</li>
				<li>Respect each other's turn to speak and try your best to not interrupt.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition to these recommendations, try to have a clear direction in terms of how you want to manage a particular conversation with a team member or a client. Try to keep it direct; otherwise, it could end up being a useless argument. </p>
			<p>The following diagram shows four steps that you can implement to achieve an effective and productive discussion:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B17366_03_02.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2: The steps to achieve a productive meeting"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2: The steps to achieve a productive meeting</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Why is communication important in the workplace?</em> Let's find out:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clear <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>communication demonstrates your leadership abilities by describing your goals to the team. Additionally, it allows your workplace to become more collaborative and agile.</li>
				<li>Effective communication has a significant impact on the productivity of the team because it keeps them engaged in important technical or non-technical decisions.</li>
				<li>It creates a positive work environment and improves the relationships that you have with clients and co-workers.</li>
				<li>It boosts the productivity of the team and, therefore, increases the profit of the organization.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Communication skills <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>are vital for conveying your ideas and vision to your team and clients. Remember that the greatest communication skill is listening to others, as that will help you to understand the situation and make proper decisions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Possessing deep analytical skills</h2>
			<p>The term <em class="italic">analytical</em> has become a buzzword in every senior tech job position. <em class="italic">So, what are analytical skills, and why are they essential for you as a solution architect?</em></p>
			<p>Analytical skills refer to <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>how you investigate a particular problem or business process, collect and analyze all of the related information logically and thoughtfully by understanding how the different elements are connected, research the possible solutions, and then come up with an ideal solution for the situation. </p>
			<p>Designing a solution is influenced by different factors; it requires a detail-oriented individual who possesses deep analytical skills with the ability to evaluate various aspects and deal with tasks that require analysis. </p>
			<p>These are the skills that you need to find solutions to various problems and difficulties or to help your team members troubleshoot a problem they are facing by proposing the proper solution.</p>
			<p>You can develop your analytical skills by getting out of your comfort zone and starting to solve complex problems. Here are <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>some of the core analytical skills that <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>should be mastered by a solution architect:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data analysis</strong>: You must have the ability to analyze the data received, and identify patterns and trends that will support you in your decisions.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Communication</strong>: You must be a good communicator to explain your findings to your team, so the client can then describe your recommendations.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Critical Thinking</strong>: You must have the ability to analyze complex problems and evaluate the information you have collected to form a rational decision.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Creativity</strong>: You should have the ability to go beyond the obvious solution in order to find the optimal one.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Research</strong>: You must learn <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>more about the problem you are <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>trying to solve. You can do this by researching online articles and posts that are relevant and learning how other architects or competitors solved a particular problem. It might support <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>you in brainstorming a possible solution.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As a solution architect, you should possess solid analytical skills because they will help you to solve complex problems that might appear during the design or development of the solution.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Showcasing brilliant project and resource management skills</h2>
			<p>Solution architects are <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>not directly responsible for these two aspects. However, they are expected to focus on business results. Therefore, they are responsible for completing the project in the most efficient way by ensuring the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The business goals of the client are being achieved.</li>
				<li>The project is being implemented within the given timeframes and budget.</li>
				<li>The team skills and assets are properly allocated and are being used efficiently to complete the project.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You are expected to intervene in the five major project management activities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project initiation</strong>: This is after clarifying the project goals and scope.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Requirements gathering and planning</strong>: This consists of developing a work breakdown structure.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project execution</strong>: This is based on the produced schedule.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance monitoring</strong>: This also includes managing change requests.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project closeout</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here is a graphic representation showing these major activities of project management:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B17366_03_03.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3: The five major activities of project management"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3: The five major activities of project management</p>
			<p>The solution architect <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>plays an important role in resource management, which is a critical part of project management. It is the process of planning and assigning resources efficiently to complete the project within the estimated time, budget, and scope, as defined at the earliest stage of the project. In software development, there are two types of resources and assets:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Intangible assets</strong> include a <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>variety of non-physical assets, such as staff skills, experience, company reputation, and time.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tangible assets</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>physical assets, such as equipment, materials, and investments. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Having project and resource management skills is important for providing a strategic direction throughout the development process by making the right decisions whether they are technical or non-technical.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Exhibiting patience with others</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">Patience</em> is a human strength. It is considered a tough skill to master; however, if you want to become an <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>effective solution architect, you must have patience, particularly during a crisis. Being patient with others in the workplace is the ability to remain tranquil in the face of difficulties and react positively to your co-workers and clients.</p>
			<p>In our fast-moving world, tasks are expected to be completed instantaneously, and delays can create a stressful situation. For instance, your clients will want their projects to be delivered on time or your manager will be expecting a report that you assigned to someone in your team who didn't deliver on time. Think about clients who are continuously changing the requirements, and think about the co-workers who may have bad habits, who are hard to deal with, or who are hard to understand. All of these difficult circumstances are beyond your control, and they can make you instantly frustrated. </p>
			<p>Losing patience with these people can complicate the situation. It could damage your relationships and leave a bad image of you. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Working collaboratively</h2>
			<p>Building an architecture <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>design and delivering a solution is a team effort. An effective architect can work collaboratively with all co-workers (including those who have different skillsets and expertise) with one goal in mind, which is to deliver the project efficiently and meet the client's targets.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at the following reasons as to why collaboration is important:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It helps you and the team to solve problems faster.</li>
				<li>It boosts motivation and brings people closer together, which can improve retention rates.</li>
				<li>It creates a learning and development environment, and, as a result, team members can learn from each other.</li>
				<li>It creates a smoother workplace by removing constraints, enabling transparency between departments, and engaging team members in most of the decisions that are made in the project.</li>
				<li>It enables a creative and innovative workplace where all members can share their ideas to innovate.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Working collaboratively is <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>of great importance for your role as a solution architect. This is because when you collaborate with your team, you ensure the delivery of not only good architecture but also a good quality product at the end of the development.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Demonstrating influencing and negotiation skills</h2>
			<p>Strong influencing and negotiation skills <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>are integral for the solution architect to resolve conflicts and develop win-win solutions. <strong class="bold">Negotiating</strong> is the ability to discuss a <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>matter with a client or a team member and reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of you. <strong class="bold">Influencing</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>key part of a successful negotiation. It is the ability to negotiate and convince others so that they accept your suggestion. </p>
			<p>Here are some essential negotiation skills that will support you in becoming an effective negotiator:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Align the negotiation flow with your strategic goals for the short term and the long term.</li>
				<li>Before starting the negotiation, try to thoroughly prepare by collecting information about the people you are meeting with and the topics that you will negotiate.</li>
				<li>Prepare <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>your <strong class="bold">best alternative to a negotiated agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">BATNA</strong>). This is in case you do not reach an agreement in the negotiation at hand.</li>
				<li>Have the ability to be rational by separating personal issues and negotiation issues. This is important to see the opportunities and reach the objectives of the negotiation. </li>
				<li>Know how to form coalitions by discussing your ideas with potential allies who share common interests with you and who can influence other people involved in the negotiation.</li>
				<li>Build trust and reputation with the people you are negotiating with. You can do this by being respectful, transparent, and committed to your promises.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You will always be in a <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>situation where you need to influence the decision-making peers involved in the solution you are designing. Keep developing your negotiation skills to build solid relationships, resolve conflicts, and make great deals.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Possessing a wide range of technical expertise</h2>
			<p>To be a true <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>pillar of innovation, a solution architect should possess extensive technical expertise with the ability to consult management and engineering teams with technical recommendations. In particular, they need to be aware of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Software engineering and architectural design</li>
				<li>Information technology architecture, infrastructure, and cloud development</li>
				<li>Project management and product management</li>
				<li>DevOps tools and practices</li>
				<li>Business analysis</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Breaking down problems efficiently</h2>
			<p>A big problem is hard to <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>deal with; sometimes, it will make you feel overwhelmed. Approach the problem with a positive attitude and make it easier on yourself and the team by breaking it down into smaller issues that are easier to solve than the original big one.</p>
			<p>Good architects can also minimize the occurrence of problems and tackle them before they occur. This can be achieved by doing good risk analyses and by keeping an eye on the details.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Being pragmatic</h2>
			<p>Every organization has its <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>own set of standards, internal politics, deadlines, budget, and more. Good architects should be aware of the restrictions they might encounter during the implementation of a project. Therefore, they should deal with problems in a practical way, rather than by using an abstract theory that is not applicable in all cases. They should come up with realistic, timely, pragmatic, and efficient solutions that fit those restrictions. This is where decisions on business value-based architecture should be reached in order to optimize the <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>company's <strong class="bold">return on investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">ROI</strong>).</p>
			<p>So far, we have discussed some of the fundamental personality traits and key skills of the solution architect. In the next section, we will highlight a few common mistakes that you should deal with to avoid client dissatisfaction and any critical issues that could affect your project deliverables.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Taking a look at the common pitfalls for architects</h1>
			<p>Too often, mistakes <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>are learned about the hard way. In this section, we are going to highlight some traps that can affect the outcome of the solution architect:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Avoid over-architecting the solution; for instance, by adding unnecessary layers and components to the solution, which can instead be replaced with simple classes. Over-architecting will increase the development activities and complicate the troubleshooting in the case of errors, which will decrease the achievements that your clients are looking for. Try to simplify your architecture and make it more aligned with the business requirements.</li>
				<li>Consider writing custom code instead of using ready-made and open-source frameworks or libraries. For instance, let's assume you need to build a responsive web solution; here, you have two options.<p>The first option is to reinvent the wheel and roll your own responsive framework. This option is costly since you need to develop the entire <strong class="bold">CSS</strong> and <strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong> from scratch. The second option is to use a popular open-source framework, such as <strong class="bold">Bootstrap</strong>, to build <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>the responsive UI, which is a less costly option.</p><p><em class="italic">Which option should you choose?</em> Of course, in such a situation the best option is to use a reliable open-source framework to shorten the development time, to avoid errors that you will face if you develop your custom framework, and to make use of the powerful capabilities that are provided by the open-source framework. You need to learn when you should develop your own code and when to use an open-source framework by deciding which one is the best option for your solution.</p></li>
				<li>Jumping into <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>development before planning or setting up the design will put the project deadlines, budgets, and goals at risk. Having a proper plan and design before starting the development is a must. It structures the work of your team members and sets expectations that should be aligned with the requirements. No matter how small or large the project you are working on, you should always follow the SDLC phases and adopt the output of each phase in order to move to the next one until you deliver the product.</li>
				<li>Not structuring the code in a way to make it reusable and extendable will result in you having a lot of repetitive code in many locations across the software, which performs the same task. This will increase the size of the source code and will complicate the maintenance tasks. This is because the code will become difficult to read and you might need to fix the same defect in many places. Try to keep <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>your code <strong class="bold">DRY</strong> (<strong class="bold">Don't Repeat Yourself</strong>), create components, make your software modular, and apply <strong class="bold">Object-Oriented Programming</strong> (<strong class="bold">OOP</strong>) when <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>required by creating abstract classes and interfaces.</li>
				<li>Developing the product without paying attention to security will deliver a software solution that is open to security vulnerabilities. Security attacks can damage the system and its associated database, which can cause downtime and your client could lose money. Securing your software solution is no longer an afterthought but a foremost one. Paying attention to security during the design and development of the software helps you avoid malware and prevent hacking attempts.</li>
				<li>Avoid relying on traditional development methodologies to build software rather than applying Agile software development methodology. Agile methodology is widely used by software development companies so that they can manage their projects effectively. It is a modern practice that adds value to your team and to the solution you are developing.<p>Agile is an evolutionary process that promotes a high level of collaboration between team members from different departments by bringing them all together to deliver the project. It increases the productivity of the team, allowing for multiple deliverables in a short time. Additionally, it allows clients to closely contribute to each stage by providing their feedback, which prevents any disappointments at the end of the project.</p></li>
				<li>Avoid not <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>paying enough attention to code optimization and performance.</li>
				<li>Avoid not spending <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>enough time on <strong class="bold">User Acceptance Testing</strong> (<strong class="bold">UAT)</strong>. All types of testing are very important in order to deliver high-quality products. UAT is a type of testing performed by the client to decide whether the requirements have been met. This is before moving to a production/live environment.<p>Without a proper UAT phase, the product could be rejected by end users for many reasons, such as bad performance, missing features, and the product being buggy. To avoid this situation, make sure you prepare, in advance, the test cases based on the use cases that were agreed with the client. These test cases will be used in the UAT phase to verify every single functionality.</p></li>
				<li>Avoid not allocating team members with the right skillsets that should be aligned with the project needs. Remember that success isn't possible without the right team members.</li>
				<li>Avoid the a of good planning by having an unrealistic timeline and budget and finding out about this at a late stage of the project. This can create conflicts, especially if you are working on multiple projects that are running in parallel. You must have a realistic plan with clear deadlines and goals; this should be identified during the planning phase of the project. You can apply the Agile methodology to avoid this pitfall.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These various pitfalls <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>can occur regularly and probably in conjunction with each other, which could affect the quality of your deliverables and the reputation you have earned with your clients. We have described a few of the many pitfalls that you might experience. Being aware of these pitfalls will prepare you so that you can overcome them. As a solution architect, you need to constantly solve problems, try new things, and help align a project with the company vision and values. </p>
			<p>In the next section, we will explore the difference between the enterprise architect, the technical architect, and the solution architect.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>The enterprise architect versus the technical architect versus the solution architect</h1>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>three <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>different <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>architecture-related <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>roles in the <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>information technology industry. Each of <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>these roles is equally essential in the software development life cycle and cannot be replaced by any other positions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enterprise architect</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technical architect</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Solution architect</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let's learn more about the difference between these roles:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4: The difference between enterprise architects, technical architects, and solution architects</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Enterprise architects</strong> are responsible for collaborating with key stakeholders to define business <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>goals and establishing the <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>entire enterprise infrastructure (such as software and hardware), which <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>supports the <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>needs of <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>the organization. They <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>mainly focus on implementing and managing complex IT solutions that target critical and strategic business goals at the same time. </p>
			<p>Meanwhile, <strong class="bold">solution architects</strong> have a practical role to play within the organization. They collect the business requirements, then analyze them, and finally, turn them into a new software solution that uses the company's standards and technology stack.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Technical architects</strong> mainly oversee the technical architecture of the solution and the core technology used in the implementation. Their main responsibility is to provide technical leadership to the development team and decide on every technical aspect of the software solution.</p>
			<p>The following diagram depicts the structure of the enterprise architecture stack in an enterprise that provides digital transformation services:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we provided a quick introduction to what solution architecture is. Then, we learned about some essential personality traits and soft skills that are required to become an effective solution architect. Later in this chapter, we highlighted few common pitfalls that should be avoided during the project development life cycle. Finally, you learned about the differences between enterprise architects, technical architects, and solution architects.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will dig deep into the principles of solution architecture, and you will learn about the seven popular UML diagrams that will help you to model your solution architecture.</p>
