    the Unity engine and the custom scripts that developers write in C#. By inheriting
    from MonoBehaviour, a script gains the ability to respond to a wide array of game
    events through specific functions, such as when a game starts, when objects collide,
    or when user input is detected. This enables developers to create complex game
    logic and interactions, from controlling character movements to managing game
    states.

    its predefined methods, which Unity calls at specific points during the game’s
    life cycle. For example, the `Start()` method is called before the first frame
    update, making it an ideal place to initialize variables or set up game elements.
    Similarly, the `Update()` method is called once per frame, making it suitable
    for handling continuous checks or inputs within the game.

    method, which Unity automatically calls when a GameObject or its component becomes
    inactive. Inside this method, a message, `"OnDisable called."`, is logged to the
    console, serving as a simple notification or debugging tool to indicate when the

    aiming to create dynamic and engaging gaming experiences. Transitioning to the

    connections through public variables or getters and setters, developers ensure
    the seamless integration of game components, enhancing both the flow of data and
    the execution of commands within the game environment.

    variables**. In this method, developers declare a public variable in a script,
    allowing other scripts to access and modify its value.

    script to update the player’s health status. The `Player` script could declare
    a public variable of type `Health` and assign the reference to the `Health` script
    in the Unity Editor. This enables the `Player` script to directly access the methods
    and variables of the `Health` script, such as updating the player’s health points
    after taking damage.

    script, applying 10 points of damage. This illustrates how scripts can interact
    and modify each other’s states in Unity.
