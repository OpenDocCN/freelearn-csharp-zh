- en: In the previous chapters, we reviewed general methodology concepts, including
    the notion of full-life cycle methodologies for business solutions. In a nutshell,
    a customer life cycle methodology begins with the solution discovery phase, continues
    with the solution delivery phases, and goes on through to the operation phase
    and any future upgrades of the solution. Microsoft Dynamics Sure Step methodology
    is an excellent example of a customer life cycle methodology and includes guidance
    in all of these areas.

    Dynamics Sure Step方法论是客户生命周期方法的一个优秀例子，并包括所有这些领域的指导。

    *Solution Selling and Driving Due Diligence*, we went deeper into the solution
    discovery phase. We talked about the solution provider embracing solution selling
    in this phase and the benefits they would gain from this systematic approach.
    For the customers, we saw how this phase helps them with their due diligence process,
    and why this phase is not only critical for the selection of a solution that matches
    the requirements and vision of their organization but also sets the stage for
    quality delivery of the envisioned solution.

    begins at the Prospect stage of the Microsoft Solution Selling Process, meaning
    that it does not get into marketing, campaigns, and other activities to generate
    awareness for a solution or to profile a particular market segment for prospective
    customers. Sure Step functions in the opportunity management stages, so it begins

    Diagnostic phase innately supports the solution provider's sales cycle, providing
    guidance and activities that lead the seller through a prescriptive selling cycle.
    You may recall that MSSP, which you were introduced to in [Chapter 2](ch02.html
    "Chapter 2. Solution Selling and Driving Due Diligence"), *Solution Selling and
    Driving Due Diligence*, was created to enable Microsoft's internal and partner
    sales mechanisms. As we discussed, MSSP is based on the solution selling concept,
    a philosophy that helps the solution provider and their buyer to forge a trusting
    relationship between them, while facilitating a working relationship between the
    two parties to craft a common solution vision for the mutual benefit of each other.

    "第二章. 解决方案销售与推动尽职调查")中介绍的MSSP，即**解决方案销售与推动尽职调查**，是为了使微软的内部和合作伙伴销售机制得以实现。正如我们讨论的，MSSP基于解决方案销售概念，这是一种帮助解决方案提供商及其买家之间建立信任关系的哲学，同时促进双方之间建立合作关系，共同制定一个对双方都有益的解决方案愿景。

    This is a key enabler of solution selling in that the seller is able to engage
    the prospective customer in a manner that resonates with them. Instead of approaching
    the customer and leading with product features and functionality and potentially

    and CRM solutions. This has been one of the most widely used set of templates
    by the Sure Step user base. In the upcoming releases, users can expect this area
    to be revamped, beginning with the AX process maps. Among the new Lifecycle Services
    tools being launched is the **Business Process Modeler** (**BPM**) tool. The BPM
    tool is an excellent evolution of process mapping—it is aligned with industry
    best practices, including **American Productivity & Quality Center** (**APQC**),
    giving the users a common framework and taxonomy to relate their own organizational
    functional flows to. As described by APQC, their "**Process Classification Framework**
    (**PCF**) is a taxonomy of business processes that allows organizations to objectively
    track and compare their performance internally and externally with organizations
    from any industry. It also forms the basis for a variety of projects related to
    business processes". APQC also explains why PCF was developed and its organizational
    benefits. "Originally envisioned as a tool to aid in performance improvement projects,
    the framework has evolved into the broad taxonomy that it is today. Organizations
    can use the PCF's common terminology to name, organize, and map their processes."

    fashioned along the lines of the corresponding Microsoft Dynamics product, it
    is not a stretch for the customer organization to take this output and use it
    as the basis for other solution evaluations. In doing so, there is also the potential
    that the customer decides to go down the path of an alternative solution to Microsoft
    Dynamics. Bearing that in mind, it is understandable that a service provider may
    expect fair compensation for their services—the service provider is putting forward
    experienced resources from their organization to enable the customer to envision
    the future state of their organization and document the requirements for a solution
    to meet this vision. In the strict sense of the engagement, the services rendered
    are akin to business consulting, even if there is a bias towards a given solution.

    Dynamics 产品独特设计的，但客户组织将此输出用作其他解决方案评估的基础并不困难。在这种情况下，客户也有可能决定选择替代 Microsoft Dynamics
    的解决方案。考虑到这一点，服务提供商期望获得公平的补偿是可以理解的——服务提供商正在提供他们组织中的经验丰富的资源，以帮助客户展望其组织的未来状态，并记录满足这一愿景的解决方案需求。在严格意义上，提供的服务类似于商业咨询，即使存在对特定解决方案的偏见。
- en: As such, the service provider can legitimately position their services for customer
    compensation. Of course, the service provider may also choose to view the engagement
    as a business investment and provide all or part of the services pro bono; however,

    to meet a given requirement cannot be overemphasized. In practice, this option
    is often not given consideration; instead, you can see the service provider coming
    up with expensive customization designs or add-on solutions as alternatives. But
    the first step should always be to examine the current workflow of the customer
    organization. We need to find answers to questions such as "are they presently
    going through the steps because of limitations in their current systems or perhaps
    because of a creative workaround that was set up sometime in the past and is no
    longer necessary" and "is there any other minor reason that a simple shift in
    a procedure could result in the company using the standard feature of the solution
    to achieve their goals?" If the answer to these questions is yes, it is preferable
    for both parties to consider a workflow change as the alternative, not only from
    the perspective of lower delivery costs for the solution but also from a long-term
    perspective—the more the customer can use standard features of a solution, the
    easier it will be for them to upgrade to future releases of the solution whenever
    they decide to do so. In the long run, this results in a lower **Total Cost of
    Ownership** (**TCO**) number, and hence a higher value for the proposed solution
    for the customer. If the seller is truly practicing the solution selling ideology,
    they will also work towards lowering the TCO for the customer and not towards
    increasing the scope of the solution via customizations. Additionally, the service
    provider should always strive to architect the simplest solution to meet a customer's
    needs, thereby lowering the overall risk profile of the proposed solution. This
    should also be a point of consideration for the seller in moving away from complex
    customizations wherever feasible.

  zh: 关于通过简单改变客户的业务流程或工作流程以满足特定要求的重要性不容忽视。在实践中，这种选择往往没有被考虑；相反，你可以看到服务提供商提出昂贵的定制设计或附加解决方案作为替代方案。但第一步始终应该是检查客户组织的当前工作流程。我们需要找到答案，例如：“他们目前是否因为现有系统的限制或可能是因为过去某个时候设置的创造性解决方案（现在不再必要）而正在执行这些步骤？”以及“是否存在其他任何微小的原因，简单的流程变动可能导致公司使用解决方案的标准功能来实现他们的目标？”如果这些问题的答案是肯定的，那么双方考虑将工作流程变更作为替代方案是更可取的，这不仅从降低解决方案交付成本的角度来看，而且从长期角度来看——客户能够使用解决方案的标准功能越多，他们升级到未来版本就越容易。从长远来看，这会导致**总拥有成本**（**TCO**）的降低，从而为客户提出的解决方案带来更高的价值。如果卖家真正在实践解决方案销售理念，他们也会努力降低客户的TCO，而不是通过定制化来扩大解决方案的范围。此外，服务提供商应始终努力设计最简单的解决方案来满足客户的需求，从而降低所提解决方案的整体风险状况。这也应该是卖家在可能的情况下避免复杂定制的一个考虑点。

    the Degree of Fit of the proposed solution to the customer's requirements. However,
    what value of Degree of Fit the solution should have for it to be acceptable is
    a contextual question. Some organizations may require a minimum of a 75 percent
    Degree of Fit for lower TCO objectives. Others may be fine with a lower value
    for the Degree of Fit due to the specific nature of their business that precludes
    them from using out-of-the-box functionality to meet their needs and could be

  zh: 执行范围评估 DA 服务的第一步是确定整体解决方案的部署方法。在这个练习中，解决方案交付团队和客户一起确定解决方案是否可以以更小、更易于管理的版本发布，或者是否希望在解决方案上线时立即实现所有功能。将解决方案分多个版本发布被称为解决方案交付的**分阶段方法**；在这里，每个版本中只启用选定的解决方案功能，每个版本都是在前一个版本的基础上构建的。分阶段方法的替代方案是在单个版本中交付完整解决方案，这通常被称为解决方案交付的**大爆炸方法**。读者需要注意的一个关键点是：不要将分阶段方法与瀑布式解决方案交付方法的阶段混淆。瀑布式阶段将整体项目或发布分解成更小的部分，而分阶段方法是将整体合作分解成多个项目或发布的技巧。

- en: A phased approach enables the customer organization to start using the solution
    much sooner, facilitating a smoother adoption of the system. As the scope for

    quicker to production, thus enabling users to start working with the system earlier
    than they would have with the big-bang approach.

    deployment of the solution. Others prefer to let the requirements of the solution
    evolve during the development activities, which is a characteristic of the agile
    approach. The Microsoft Dynamics Sure Step methodology supports both approaches

- en: The next step for the sales and solution delivery team in the execution of the
    Scoping Assessment Decision Accelerator service is to work with the customer and
    understand their solution priorities using the solution blueprint as the input.
    To do so, the delivery team will need to identify the inherent constraints as
    well as any imposed constraints for the project. Inherent constraints are often
    imposed by the system; for example, a system will need a certain logical configuration
    order, such as starting with the chart of accounts, and then moving to the general
    ledger of an ERP system. Imposed constraints, on the other hand, are typically
    external constraints; for example, the customer may have specific licensed software
    that is up for renewal, and that the customer does not desire to renew, and would
    prefer that the corresponding module of the new solution be enabled before their
    license for the third-party software expires. Understanding these constraints
    allows the solution delivery team to come up with a schedule that meets the customer's
    objectives for the new solution.

    develop costing spreadsheets and databases to support them in these tasks and
    typically populate the spreadsheets based on their experiences on similar past
    projects. Other organizations use Estimator tools that include base values for
    enabling specific functionality. These base values may have been garnered from
    past history but typically constitute the average value from the experiences of
    several consultants over multiple projects. As such, these Estimator tools provide
    a consistent, repeatable framework for estimating solution delivery efforts. Of

    times, is a Fixed Scope engagement. In this approach, the customer and service
    provider agree to a very strict definition of the requirements in scope at the
    outset, and the service provider is then responsible for delivering all the requirements
    for the agreed fee. This approach is typically more risky for the service provider,
    especially in the larger engagements. The scope of the engagement typically goes
    through some levels of modification during the course of the implementation. This
    typically results in the service providers building a risk quotient into their
    fee structure to ensure that they are covered to some extent in cases of mitigating
    circumstances. It bears mention that Sure Step includes guidance and templates

    be used. That said, there are three critical DA services that should be executed

- en: The first DA service, Requirements and Process Review, is also important if
    the customer does not have a full grasp of the requirements for the new solution
    or the future processes with the new solution. Customers increasingly seem to
    start their business solution selection process with a Request for Proposal. If
    the RFP encompasses a thorough composition of the organization's requirements
    and future processes, the seller can begin with the Fit Gap exercise to determine
    whether the requirements fit well with their solution. However, as noted earlier,
    even if a customer already has an RFP in place, it is possible that another competitor
    or vendor assisted the customer with developing the requirements. In that case,
    you may have to execute the Requirements and Process Review DA service, at least
    to an extent.

  zh: 第一个DA服务，需求与流程审查，如果客户对新解决方案或新解决方案的未来流程没有全面了解，也是非常重要的。客户似乎越来越多地以请求提案（RFP）开始他们的业务解决方案选择过程。如果RFP包含了组织需求及未来流程的详尽组成，卖家可以开始进行适配性差距练习，以确定需求是否与他们的解决方案很好地匹配。然而，正如之前所提到的，即使客户已经有一个RFP，也可能有其他竞争对手或供应商帮助客户制定需求。在这种情况下，你可能需要执行需求与流程审查的DA服务，至少在一定程度上。
- en: Determining the Degree of Fit of the solution is of critical importance, as
    is determining the solution blueprint, the future infrastructure, the approach,
    timeline, and costs to deliver the proposed solution. This is why the Fit Gap
    and Solution Blueprint DA, Architecture Assessment DA, and Scoping Assessment
    DA are deemed critical DA Offering services. If, after executing these offerings,
    the customer is convinced that they have the right solution to meet their needs,
    the sales team may be able to go straight to the Final Licensing and Services
    Agreements activity and skip the Proof of Concept and Business Case DA services.

- en: For smaller deals, questions often arise from sales teams about whether or not
    the Sure Step Decision Accelerator Offering services are still applicable. Irrespective
    of whether the DA Offerings are positioned as paid offerings, they are still applicable
    because they reduce the risk factor for a solution of this importance for the
    customer as well as for the service provider, who ensures that they have documented
    and accounted for all the requirements in their proposal. It is important to remember
    that the duration for each of the DA Offerings is dictated by the sales and customer
    teams. So, for smaller engagements, it still behooves the solution provider to
    at least utilize the templates provided in Sure Step and go through the steps
    in an abridged manner if needed. This will ensure that they are not making any
    erroneous assumptions and they are also clearly communicating to the customer
    their understanding of the requirements and the vision of the solution. Going
    through this process also reduces the risk of underestimating the deal as the
    sales teams may unearth points that they may not have considered during this process.
    Therefore, at the very least, the sales teams should use the Sure Step templates
    to document their assumptions and solution vision and make them known to the customer.
    One option to execute this process is to combine the necessary services, especially
    the three key ones, and execute the offering as a series of steps and produce
    summary documentation within the Statement of Work.

    Step提供的模板，并在必要时以简化的方式完成步骤。这将确保他们不会做出任何错误的假设，并且他们也能清楚地向客户传达他们对需求的理解和解决方案的愿景。通过这个过程还可以降低低估交易的风险，因为销售团队可能会发现他们在这一过程中没有考虑到的点。因此，至少，销售团队应使用Sure

    it is recommended that you use a phased approach, in which the first release is
    a Technical Upgrade to bring the solution to the current product version, and

- en: In this chapter, we focused on the Diagnostic phase of Sure Step. We discussed
    how this phase has been designed for a dual purpose——to assist the seller to position
    the solutions and close the sale while helping the customer conduct their due
    diligence process and select the right solution to meet their needs. We covered
    the usage of the Decision Accelerator Offering services in the Diagnostic phase
    for a new Dynamics customer, the Diagnostic phase for a Dynamics CRM customer
    leveraging the Accelerated POC with CRM Online service, and the Diagnostic phase
    for an existing Dynamics customer. We also discussed industry/vertical solutions
    for manufacturing, public sector, retail and service sector, as well as cross-industry/horizontal
    solutions for customer care and extended CRM.

  zh: 在本章中，我们专注于Sure Step的诊断阶段。我们讨论了这一阶段是如何被设计成双重目的的——既帮助销售者定位解决方案并完成销售，又帮助客户进行尽职调查过程并选择满足他们需求的正确解决方案。我们涵盖了为新Dynamics客户在诊断阶段使用决策加速器服务的情况，为利用CRM在线服务进行加速POC的Dynamics
    CRM客户进行诊断阶段的情况，以及为现有Dynamics客户进行的诊断阶段。我们还讨论了制造业、公共部门、零售和服务行业的行业/垂直解决方案，以及客户关怀和扩展CRM的跨行业/横向解决方案。
- en: The Diagnostic phase is a very important one. If the due diligence activities
    are not executed properly, the implementation process may suffer and the customer's
    satisfaction will be low. If done right, it could lead to effective, on-cost,
    on-time, and high-quality solution delivery. It also sets the stage for a smooth
    solution delivery process.
