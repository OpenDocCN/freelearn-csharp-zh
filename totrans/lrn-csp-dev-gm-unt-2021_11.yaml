    they had to offer beyond the basic features introduced at the beginning of the
    book. In this chapter, we'll take a closer look at new collection types and learn
    about their intermediate-level capabilities. Remember, being a good programmer
    isn't about memorizing code, it's about choosing the right tool for the right
    job.

- en: Each of the new collection types in this chapter has a specific purpose. For
    most scenarios where you need a collection of data, a list or array works just
    fine. However, when you need temporary storage or control over the order of collection
    elements, or more specifically, the order they are accessed, look to stacks and
    queues. When you need to perform operations that depend on every element in a
    collection to be unique, meaning not duplicated, look to HashSets.

- en: At its most basic level, a stack is a collection of elements of the same specified
    type. The length of a stack is variable, meaning it can change depending on how
    many elements it's holding. The important difference between a stack and a list
    or array is how the elements are stored. While lists or arrays store elements
    by index, stacks follow the **last-in-first-out** (**LIFO**) model, meaning the
    last element in the stack is the first accessible element. This is useful when
    you want to access elements in reverse order. You should note that they can store
    `null` and duplicate values. A helpful analogy is a stack of plates—the last plate
    you put on the stack is the first one you can easily get to. Once it's removed,
    the next-to-last plate you stacked is accessible, and so on.

    because the current set is modified after each operation is executed. If you keep
    using the same sets throughout, you will get different results.

    key points from what we've just learned. Topics that don't always have a 1-to-1
    relationship with the actual game prototype we're building need a little extra
    love sometimes.

    any of these other collection types when I could just use lists for everything?
    And that''s a perfectly valid question. The easy answer is that stacks, queues,
    and HashSets offer better performance than lists when applied in the correct circumstances.
    For example, when you need to store items in a specific order, and access them
    in a specific order, a stack would be more efficient than a list.'

- en: The more complicated answer is that using different collection types enforces
    how your code is allowed to interact with them and their elements. This is a mark
    of good code design, as it removes any ambiguity on how you're planning to use
    a collection. With lists everywhere, things get confusing when you don't remember
    what functions you're asking them to perform.

    tool for the job at hand. More importantly, you need to have different tools available

    about three new collection types, and how they can be used in different situations.

- en: Stacks are great if you want to access your collection elements in the reverse
    order that they were added, queues are your ticket if you want to access your
    elements in sequential order, and both are ideal for temporary storage. The important
    difference between these collection types and lists or arrays is how they can
    be accessed with popping and peeking operations. Lastly, you learned about the
    almighty HashSet and its performance-based mathematical set operations. In situations
    where you need to work with unique values and perform additions, comparisons,
    or subtractions on large collections, these are key.

    journey.
