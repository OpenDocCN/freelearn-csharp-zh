			<p>In the previous chapter, we learned about some of the essential traits and skills that are needed to build your potential and become an effective solution architect. We also looked at a quick overview of what solution architecture is. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we'll begin to focus more on solution architecture practices. In particular, we'll take a look at the key principles of solution architecture, and we'll explore popular <strong class="bold">Unified Modeling Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">UML</strong>) diagrams that are recommended for designing medium- to large-scale solutions.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exploring the key principles of solution architecture</li>
				<li>Delving into the most frequently used UML diagrams with concrete examples</li>
				<li>Walking through the process of creating a design architecture with UML</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have enriched your knowledge and understanding of popular UML diagrams, and you will have learned how to use them in your design. Additionally, you will learn about the key principles of solution architecture and how they can influence your design process. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Exploring the key principles of solution architecture</h1>
			<p>Architecture principles <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>outline the fundamental procedures and guidelines that are required to design, build, and deploy a successful software solution. They are meant to influence your architecture approach and improve the quality attributes of the solution.</p>
			<p>There are many principles out there that we can adopt in our methodology of work to prepare the design architecture. We can even define our own principles if we think they will add value to the architecture design or if we think they will efficiently improve the design process. Most importantly, we need to make sure we offer a good balance between theory and practice and that we adopt practical and powerful principles that will drive the business and technical changes in our solution's architectures. </p>
			<p>In general, we should aim for between 10 and 20 guiding principles for our solution architecture practices. Make sure that you do not have too many principles. This is because they become hard to remember and difficult to apply, which will limit our architecture's flexibility. In such cases, it is better to keep them simple and focused.</p>
			<p>There is a standard way and recommended format that you can use to define an architecture principle. Usually, a <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>principle is divided into four main parts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Name</strong>: The name should reflect the core value of the principle. It should be simple and easy to remember.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: The description is a statement that clearly defines and explains the principle.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rationale</strong>: The rationale is a statement that highlights the business benefits of obeying the principle. It can also explain the correlation with other principles.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Implications</strong>: The implications should highlight the technical requirements and business requirements that are needed to adopt this principle.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These elements are meant to support the understanding of each principle and justify its usage in the solution architecture.</p>
			<p>Any principle we adopt should fall into a specific category or domain. According to <strong class="bold">The Open Group Architecture Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">TOGAF</strong>), architecture <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>principles broadly fall into four domains:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Business principles</strong>: These are a <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>set of guidelines that focus on the business aspects of the solution.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data principles</strong>: These define the <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>standard guidelines to manage and structure data. Additionally, they enforce a set of security measures in which to protect the solution assets. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application principles</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>deal with the attributes of an application such as performance, user experience, and how modules or subsystems interact with each other.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technology principles</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>elaborate on the technical guidelines and requirements that are necessary for the success and continuity of the solution.<p class="callout-heading">Tip:</p><p class="callout">TOGAF is a <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>framework and methodology that has been developed to provide a high-level approach to design and also build enterprise information technology architecture. You can learn more about architecture principles, as <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>defined by TOGAF, at <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap20.html&#13;">https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap20.html</a></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here is an illustration <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>that highlights the key principles of solution architecture. You can see that the four domains are consolidating a set of design guidelines in different domains to produce a solution that is flexible, scalable, and reusable: </p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1: The recommended key principles of the .NET solution architecture</p>
			<p>In the upcoming sections, we will explore the preceding principles that you really need to know. We can adopt <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>these principles as is, or we can add, modify, and remove some principles based on our needs. However, always remember that a principle is made to benefit the solution we are suggesting, not to add any obstacles or complications. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Business principles</h2>
			<p>The solution architecture, including <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>all the development <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>deliverables and their quality, is of critical importance. However, we shouldn't only focus on the project plan, schedule, and outcome. Remember that the reason you are building the solution is to solve business problems. Therefore, it is a must for the solution architecture to align with the business goals and objectives. In the following sections, we will discuss three <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>business principles that should be <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>taken into account.</p>
			<h3>Maximizing the benefit to t<a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>he enterprise</h3>
			<p>All architectural and information <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>management decisions must be made in a way that ensures the maximum number of benefits to the entire enterprise. For instance, the solution should bring long-term values to all entities within the enterprise, not solely to one department or minor group. This principle encourages the high-performing collaboration of service above self.</p>
			<h3>Information management is everybody's business</h3>
			<p>All key stakeholders, business experts, and technical teams are responsible for coordinating together as <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>one committee to define the business objectives of the solution and ensuring that they align with the enterprise goals. Essentially, everyone in this committee is responsible for doing their own part in building the solution and managing it.</p>
			<h3>Business continuity</h3>
			<p>In the case of system failure, the <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>solution architecture should ensure the business continuity of the enterprise. Put simply, any kind of system failure, including hardware, software, and data corruption should not affect the continuity of the business activities and operations. For instance, the solution design should suggest a state-of-the-art recovery mechanism, system redundancy, or failover backup plan to smooth the operation of the business functions in the case of disasters. The key stakeholders should define the criticality of the solution to the enterprise operations and decide what type of failover plan should be applied to ensure business continuity.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Data principles</h2>
			<p>Data is an essential part of <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>business processes; it is a <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>valuable asset that empowers enterprise stakeholders to make strategic decisions based on key metrics and performance indicators. There are three data principles that should be taken into account when designing and building a software solution. We will <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>explore <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>each of them next.</p>
			<h3>Data is an asset</h3>
			<p>Although many architects <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>know about this principle already, we still find that data is not considered with a high level of importance in the way it should be. Data is a core business asset of the organization. Therefore, the design of a solution should ensure the proper storing, managing, and retrieving of the data with high-security measures for better protection.</p>
			<h3>Data is shared</h3>
			<p>Accurate data that is stored in a centralized repository is the backbone of the software solution, and timely <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>access to the data is very important to improve the efficiency of the decision-makers who are using the solution. Additionally, business users need data in order to perform their daily duties. Therefore, your solution design should allow timely access to the data based on the access rights of your users.</p>
			<h3>Data security</h3>
			<p>The software solution <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>should ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data. It should protect the data and prohibit unauthorized access or unlawful processing. There are many data policies out there to protect the data; we need to comply with these policies based on our target users. For instance, if we are building a software solution targeting European citizens, then <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>complying with the <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDPR</strong>) is a must.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Application principles</h2>
			<p>The guiding principles of <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>modern applications <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>are evolving. They should be dynamic principles; remember that what was applicable in the past is not relevant in today's architecture. Always look to improve the principles that you adopt and make it a continuous phenomenon. Here are the principles that really matter and that make a <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>difference in the <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>delivery of modern and efficient applications.</p>
			<h3>Ease of use</h3>
			<p>The application <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>should be user-friendly, easy to use, and visually appealing. We should embrace simplicity; that is because the easier an application is to use the higher the chance that it will be adopted by our end users. Always put the users first; they are looking to use applications that can facilitate their work and make it efficient in a short period without having to spend a long time learning about it before they start getting value from it.</p>
			<h3>Optimized application speed</h3>
			<p>We live in the era of <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>digital transformation; users are looking for real-time response applications. Therefore, the speed of the application is an important factor to consider, as it can affect the entire user experience.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Technology principles</h2>
			<p>Our technology principles <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>should always follow <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>the latest technology trends. It is very important to modernize your company's technology platforms and development practices. This will allow you to design modern digital solutions. Let's explore the three principles that should be adopted in any .NET development team. We have listed them next.</p>
			<h3>Working toward a cloud-native future</h3>
			<p>Cloud-native applications <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>have proven to be the future of software. The solution we are trying to build can benefit from the platforms, services, and processes that are hosted in the cloud. For instance, the Azure services are highly scalable, easy to modify, and connected, which allows us to extend the application's capabilities with less coding.</p>
			<h3>Using .NET Core (.NET 5 or later)</h3>
			<p>The latest <a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>release of .NET Core is called <strong class="bold">.NET 5</strong>. It is a <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>free and open source framework that can be used to build any type of application. It is a cross-platform framework that has inherited all the significant advantages of the regular .NET Framework. One of the key improvements of .NET Core is the performance, so consider using this framework when you are building new solutions.</p>
			<h3>Automating repetitive development tasks</h3>
			<p>Preparing the release of <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>your solution can be time-consuming, particularly if you are aiming to release several builds and hotfixes. You can plan out automated jobs to minimize the manual intervention needed within such tasks, make use of DevOps' tools to automate your builds, and test plans, too.</p>
			<p>In this section, we learned about the key principles that should be adopted in your solution architecture. These principles provide guidelines for four primary aspects of the solution: business, data, application, and technology. Applying these principles will give you the ability to deliver a solid solution that is scalable, reusable, and easy to maintain.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will explore six popular UML diagrams that you should use when designing a software solution.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Learning to model software architecture using UML</h1>
			<p>UML is a standard graphical <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>representation that <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>allows us to visualize the specification and design architecture of the software solution; it is a simplified way in which to communicate our architecture to the solution stakeholders. The purpose of the UML is to provide the development team and the business analysts with a unified design modeling notation that empowers them to explain complex business processes with simplified diagrams. Additionally, it enables us to construct and visualize the different software components and how they relate together, which defines the entire design architecture of the solution. </p>
			<p>There are two categories of UML diagrams: <strong class="bold">structural</strong> and <strong class="bold">behavioral</strong>. Structural diagrams <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>emphasize the static view of the system. They are used to visualize the different components and objects of the software. Mainly, they describe what is contained in a system.</p>
			<p>Behavioral diagrams <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>emphasize the dynamic view of the system. They are used to visualize the business specifications by describing the processes and functionalities supported by the software. Primarily, they describe what must happen in a system.</p>
			<p>The following diagram shows the different types of UML diagrams:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer040" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2: A list of UML diagram types</p>
			<p>In the upcoming sections, we <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>will explore the most <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>frequently used diagrams. Although there are many different types of UML diagrams that we can use to model solution architecture or describe system functionalities, we will explore the popular UML diagrams that are frequently used by most architects to document the different aspects of a software solution. They are listed as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Component diagrams</li>
				<li>Class diagrams</li>
				<li>Sequence diagrams</li>
				<li>State diagrams</li>
				<li>Activity diagrams</li>
				<li>Package diagrams</li>
				<li>Use case diagrams</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will learn when to <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>use each diagram, and we <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>will also explore the different notations and symbols of each. Then, we will examine an example of each diagram. Let's start learning about these diagrams next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Component diagrams</h2>
			<p>The UML component diagram is <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>used to graphically represent the <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>different modules and components in the software system, including the relationship and interaction between these modules. A module is a set of classes or interfaces that provides different functionalities but are grouped into one business routine. </p>
			<h3>The benefits of component diagrams</h3>
			<p>Component diagrams <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>can help you by doing the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Visualizing the overall physical structure of the software system</li>
				<li>Describing the system's components and how they are related</li>
				<li>Grouping the object-oriented classes based on a common service objective</li>
				<li>Modeling the .NET source code or the database of the system</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The notations and symbols of a component diagram</h3>
			<p>Here are the <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>different <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>shapes and symbols used to draw a component diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer041" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3: The notations and symbols of a component diagram</p>
			<h3>The component diagram of a shopping system</h3>
			<p>Let's assume that we want to <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>build a simple online shopping solution. We will use a component diagram to describe the different components in this system. </p>
			<p>First, we need to identify these components by grouping the functional requirements according to their purpose. In this example, we have three components:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The orders</li>
				<li>The customer accounts</li>
				<li>The products inventory</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we need to identify and visualize the relationships between these components. To make an order, the customer should provide the necessary input to finalize the order. That's why we need to use the interface symbol to relate the order to the customer; the customer should then select one or more products from the inventory. This will ensure that an order is fully associated with the products. So, we will use the dependency symbol to relate the order to the products. Here is an example of a component diagram describing the three components along with their interactions:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer042" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.04_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4: A UML component diagram for online shopping"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4: A UML component diagram for online shopping</p>
			<p>Note that you can use <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>the component diagram to illustrate the physical files in your source code. This is very helpful when doing forward or reverse engineering to identify the set of source code files. Additionally, you can use the component diagram to model a physical database.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Class diagrams</h2>
			<p>The UML class diagram is used to <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>describe the structure of the <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>object-oriented system by graphically representing the classes with their attributes and operations, including the relationships between these classes.</p>
			<h3>The benefits of class diagrams</h3>
			<p>Class diagrams are <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>very popular among software engineers. They are very powerful and can be beneficial when you want to describe the object-oriented classes within the software system. We can use UML class diagrams to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Describe each class in the system with its structural features (attributes) along with its behavioral futures (operations).</li>
				<li>Draw the relationships between classes, such as <strong class="bold">abstraction</strong> and <strong class="bold">association</strong>.</li>
				<li>Visualize the data models of the system.</li>
				<li>Create a detailed model of the software from a business perspective, which is very helpful for non-technical stakeholders in order to understand the general overview of the system.</li>
				<li>Generate <strong class="bold">C#</strong> source code from the class diagrams.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The notations and symbols of a class diagram</h3>
			<p>Class diagrams are <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>simple and easy <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>to read. Here is an example class diagram to help you understand the different notations:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer043" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.05_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5: An example class diagram"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5: An example class diagram</p>
			<p>As you can see, the <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>standard class notation is composed of three <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>sections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The upper section contains the name of the class.</li>
				<li>The middle section contains the class attributes/members with their types.</li>
				<li>The bottom section contains the class methods displayed in a list format.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are different visibility symbols that are used to indicate the access level of information contained in a class:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer044" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.06_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6: C# access modifiers and their symbols in UML"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6: C# access modifiers and their symbols in UML</p>
			<p>We can use <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>cardinality notations to define the type of relationship between <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>two classes. For example, one customer can have one or more orders (that is, one to many relationships), while another order can have one customer (that is, one to one). The following table shows the different symbols of cardinality:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer045" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.07_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 4.7: Cardinality types"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7: Cardinality types</p>
			<p>There are different <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>types of relationships between classes. The following <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>table shows the symbols of these relationships:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer046" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.08_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 4.8: The relationship types between classes"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.8: The relationship types between classes</p>
			<h3>The class diagram of an online shopping system</h3>
			<p>In <em class="italic">The component diagram of an online shopping system</em> section, we visualized the component <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>diagram for an online shopping system. In this section, we will illustrate the class diagram of this system:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer047" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.09_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 4.9: A class diagram of an online shopping system"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9: A class diagram of an online shopping system</p>
			<p>As you can see, each box represents a class in the header. We should provide the class name and then list all the properties and operations of the class. The interaction between the classes is visualized through the lines. We call them relationships.</p>
			<p>The class diagram can be used during the entire life cycle of the software, starting with visualizing the high-level conceptual idea of the software, then when creating a detailed understanding of the specifications, and, finally, during the implementation of the software. The class diagram is an essential modeling technique that is used to visualize all the object-oriented <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>objects in your system, so make sure you master it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Sequence diagrams</h2>
			<p>A sequence diagram is used to <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>document a business or logical process. It illustrates the flow of events and messages exchanged between objects <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>during the execution of a process. It is considered an interactive diagram because it can describe a use case or an operation supported by the software.</p>
			<p>This interactive operation can happen between a user and the software you are building, between your software and other systems (such as middleware integrations), or between the sub-modules within the same software. For example, we can use the sequence diagram to explain the authentication mechanism in our system or to illustrate the booking process of a hotel reservation system.</p>
			<h3>The benefits of sequence diagrams</h3>
			<p>Sequence diagrams are <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>very helpful when it comes to describing a complex operation or a use case. You simply highlight the objects involved, the order of the steps in the operation, and the messages exchanged from the beginning of the process until completion. You can use sequence diagrams if you want to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Explain a complex use case with several steps.</li>
				<li>Model the interaction between objects and components during an operation.</li>
				<li>Illustrate an integrated procedure between your system and another third-party system.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The notations and symbols of a sequence diagram </h3>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>table lists <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>the basic notations and symbols that you must know in order to create a sequence diagram:</p>
			<div>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.10: The notations and symbols of a sequence diagram</p>
			<p>In the next section, we'll create a sequence diagram.</p>
			<h3>The sequence diagram of a shopping cart</h3>
			<p>In the following example, we <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>have illustrated a simple sequence diagram of an example use case for an online shopping process. The diagram includes these lifelines:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The customer who wants to shop from the online system.</li>
				<li>The shopping cart interface, which holds the items that a user wants to buy.</li>
				<li>The order module, which processes the user request and confirms the payment.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The process is described using these sequence messages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Users can add a product to the shopping cart.</li>
				<li>Users can remove a product from the shopping cart.</li>
				<li>Users can adjust the number of items.</li>
				<li>Users can see the total price of the selected items.</li>
				<li>Users can confirm the order.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following diagram contains a loop fragment that allows the user to add more products or items to the shopping cart before confirming the final order:</p>
			<div>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.11: A sequence diagram of the shopping cart process</p>
			<p>In the next section, we'll learn <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>about state diagrams.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>State diagrams</h2>
			<p>A state diagram (or a state machine diagram) is typically <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>convenient when you want to describe how your <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>system behaves and responds. It is a combination of states, transitions, events, and activities. It is used to model the process of a particular function and shows all of the transitions from one state to another. It can also describe a single object and illustrate how that object behaves in response to a series of events in your system. The state of an entity is defined by the values of its attributes, which are controlled by a particular event at a specific time.</p>
			<p>State diagrams are very useful when you wish to model the behavior of an interface, class, or collaboration, and the business processes triggered by specific events. It also helps you improve processes by eliminating unnecessary steps and identifying missing steps that should be added to the process to make it more efficient.</p>
			<h3>The benefits of state diagrams</h3>
			<p>State diagrams are <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>used to describe how an event can change the behavior of a process. We can use state diagrams to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Visualize the dynamic view of a system.</li>
				<li>Model the flow of states in a business process scenario.</li>
				<li>Explain an event-driven process using the state of objects when they move from one step to another.</li>
				<li>Illustrate interactive functionalities in the system.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The notations and symbols of a state diagram </h3>
			<p>The following table <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>lists the basic notations and symbols that you <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>must know in order to create a state diagram:</p>
			<div>

			<p>In the next section, we will use these symbols to draw a state diagram to describe a two-factor authentication process.</p>
			<h3>The state diagram of a two-factor authentication process</h3>

			<p>The preceding diagram shows the first event that occurs as a result of the user providing their login credentials. Then, the system validates the credentials and sends the authentication token back to the user if the credentials are valid; otherwise, the user is requested to enter the valid credentials again. After that, the user should submit the token for verification by the system, which will decide to complete the login process if the token is valid; otherwise, the user is requested to re-enter the token to continue.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Activity diagrams</h2>
			<p>One of the important <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>diagrams in UML is the activity diagram. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>similar to the state diagram in terms of illustrating the dynamic view of the system. An activity diagram is a flowchart that describes the flow of control from one activity to another activity among the objects in a system. It is mostly used to model business processes. The activities described in an activity diagram can be sequential and concurrent.</p>
			<h3>The benefits of activity diagrams</h3>
			<p>An activity diagram is a <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>useful flowchart that describes the activities performed by a process in our system. Activity diagrams can help us to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Explain the steps of a use case scenario by describing all of the activities.</li>
				<li>Learn the logic of a particular algorithm.</li>
				<li>Brainstorm and model business processes and workflows. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The notations and symbols of an activity diagram </h3>
			<p>Before you <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>begin creating <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>an activity diagram, you must understand its notations and symbols. The following table lists the main symbols of an activity diagram:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.14: The notations and symbols of an activity diagram</p>
			<p>In the next section, we'll take a look at an example of an activity diagram.</p>
			<h3>The activity diagram of an ATM system</h3>
			<p>In the following example, we <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>have described a basic <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>process for an ATM system using an activity diagram:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.15: An activity diagram for an ATM system</p>
			<p>As you can see, the <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>preceding diagram describes the process of an <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>ATM transaction. It starts by inserting the card and then providing the PIN code. Initially, the server will verify the PIN code. If it is valid, then the server will advise the ATM to allow the customer to proceed, enter the withdrawal amount, and complete the <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>transaction; otherwise, the <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>card will be ejected.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Package diagrams</h2>
			<p>The main purpose of <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>using a package diagram is to describe the <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>high-level logical architecture of our system by visualizing the various layers along with their dependencies in which a layer represents a group of classes. The physical components in the system are grouped into layers based on their roles and the tasks they perform in the system. It is possible to create nested layers within a single layer to describe the advanced details of a major component.</p>
			<p>After defining the main layers in your system, we need to visualize the dependencies or relationships between the layers. This will describe the interactions that are occurring between layers.</p>
			<h3>The benefits of package diagrams</h3>
			<p>By unifying the <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>major components into layers, a package diagram can make our architecture easy to understand. We can use the package diagram to help us perform the following tasks:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Explain the high-level logical architecture and structure of the system.</li>
				<li>Visualize the major components or functional units of the design and their interdependencies.</li>
				<li>Identify the possibilities of integrating your system with a third-party system.</li>
				<li>Discover gaps in the architecture that could prevent your system from evolving.</li>
				<li>Communicate the effort that is required in the case of a major change that might affect several layers.</li>
				<li>Align with the development team on the intended architecture. This diagram provides you with the ability to compare your architecture with what is being implemented during the development.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The notations and symbols of a package diagram</h3>

			<p>In the following section, we'll examine the package diagram of an ASP.NET web solution.</p>
			<h3>The package diagram of an ASP.NET web solution</h3>
			<p>In the following diagram, we <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>have used a <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>package diagram to describe the high-level architecture of a typical ASP.NET solution without mentioning any details about the classes and assets within each package:</p>
			<div>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.17: A package diagram for a typical ASP.NET solution</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>preceding diagram, we have represented the packages <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>within the multitier architecture of an ASP.NET solution. The <strong class="bold">Presentation Layer</strong> includes the user interface of the solution, and the <strong class="bold">Services Layer</strong> represents a middleware service that provides high-level communication services to web and mobile apps. The <strong class="bold">Business Layer</strong> holds all the business logic and entities. As for the <strong class="bold">Data Layer</strong>, this includes methods in which to access data stored in the database.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Use case diagrams</h2>
			<p>One of the most exciting <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>moments in software engineering is the <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>point at which the product you are designing and developing meets the customer's needs. There is nothing better than having clear use cases to reach this target. Use cases are essential for describing the product from the client's perspective. There are two types of use cases: <strong class="bold">textual</strong> and <strong class="bold">visual</strong>.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B17366_01_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Principles of the Software Development Life Cycle</em>, we <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>learned about textual use cases and how to prepare them. In this section, we are going to cover the <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>visual representations of use cases. </p>
			<p>A use case diagram is used to visualize the user's requirements; more specifically, it is used to visualize the system behavior and the interaction between the users and the system. </p>
			<h3>The benefits of use case diagrams</h3>
			<p>A use case diagram is a <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>simple and effective technique that can be used to visualize the user's interaction with the system. It doesn't show all the detailed user requirements but only the interaction of the use case. Use case diagrams can help you by doing the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Illustrating the users' interaction with the software</li>
				<li>Visualizing the functional needs and the scope of the system</li>
				<li>Showing the high-level steps of a use case</li>
				<li>Aligning the user's requirements with the implementation and supporting the generation of the test cases</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The notations and symbols of a use case diagram </h3>
			<p>The notations of a <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>use case <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>diagram are simple and straightforward. The following table lists the main symbols of a use case diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer056" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.18: The notations and symbols of a use case diagram</p>
			<h3>A use case diagram for the interaction between the customer and the ATM</h3>
			<p>In the following diagram, we <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>created a use case diagram to describe the main functionalities supported by the ATM system, including the interaction with the customer:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer057" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.19: A use case diagram for an ATM system</p>
			<p>In the preceding diagram, the <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>actor is the customer who is using the ATM system and trying to authenticate to complete a transaction. The colored ellipses represent the functionalities supported by the system, and the lines represent the association and interaction between the blocks.</p>
			<p>In this section, we learned about the most frequently used UML diagrams that are essential to document many aspects of the solution such as the solution design, the structure of the object-oriented system, and the business and logical processes. We also learned about how our system behaves and responds to user interactions, the flow of control from one activity to another activity among the objects in the system, the high-level logical layers of your system with their dependencies, and the requirements from the client's perspective. </p>
			<p>In the next section, we will learn how to create a solution architecture using UML.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Designing architecture with UML</h1>
			<p>So far, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>learned that a UML diagram is a single <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>simplified representation of the software. We will need to build various UML diagrams in order to understand the complete aspects of the system and to communicate our architecture design to stakeholders and different types of users. Grouping these UML diagrams into logical subsets will create a particular view of the system. The architecture design is represented in a collection of five views. These views are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use case view</strong>: The <strong class="bold">use case view</strong> represents the focal point for all of the other views because it includes the user requirements, including all of the system functionalities. Without this view, you cannot build the other views.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Design view</strong>: The <strong class="bold">design view</strong> is intended to illustrate how the functionality defined in the <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>use case view is designed inside <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>the system in terms of classes and their relationships. This view is mainly described by the UML class diagram.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Implementation view</strong>: The <strong class="bold">implementation view</strong> describes the core components of the system and the interaction between them. It is mainly represented by the UML component diagram.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Process view</strong>: The <strong class="bold">process view</strong> describes the flow supported by the system. It does this by converging the performance, scalability, and throughput of the system. It is mainly represented by the UML class diagram and is similar to the <strong class="bold">design view</strong>, but focuses on the active classes involved in the processes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Deployment view</strong>: The <strong class="bold">deployment view</strong> describes the deployment of the system by focusing on the system topology, distribution, delivery, and installation. It is represented by the UML deployment diagram.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following diagram illustrates the five views along with the use case view in the center, which is connected to all of the other views:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.20: System architecture views</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>following table <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>summarizes the architecture views, along with the related UML diagrams, to help in the understanding of the different aspects of the system:</p>
			<div>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.21: System architecture views along with their related UML diagrams</p>
			<p>The solution architect is <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>responsible for creating the <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>initial version of these views with their related diagrams and handling the updates that construct the solution architecture. The entire solution architecture is used to influence and guide the development activities throughout the project life cycle.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we explored the key principles that outline the fundamental procedures and guidelines required to design, build, and deploy a software solution. Additionally, we learned about the essential UML diagrams with real examples to illustrate the different elements in each diagram, along with their benefits, and when to use each of them. Later in this chapter, we explored the process that is involved when constructing a solution architecture with UML.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will dig deep into the core architecture patterns. We will focus on the microservices architecture, and we will learn how to choose the right pattern for a specific solution.</p>
