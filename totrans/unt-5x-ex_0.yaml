- en: Video games are a cultural phenomenon that has captivated, entertained, and
    moved billions of people worldwide over the past fifty years. As an industry and
    movement, video games are an exciting place to be, both for the developer and
    the artist. In these roles your vision, ideas, and work can influence wide audiences,
    shaping and changing generation after generation in an unprecedented way. In more
    recent times, there's been a general movement towards democratizing game development,
    making the development process simpler, smoother and more accessible to a wider
    audience, including developers perhaps working from home on a very limited budget.
    Instrumental in this movement is the Unity engine, which forms the main subject
    of this book. The Unity engine is a computer program that works with your existing
    asset pipeline (such as 3D modeling software) and is intended for compiling video
    games that work seamlessly across multiple platforms and devices, including Windows,
    Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and Windows Phone. Using Unity, developers import ready-made
    assets (such as music, textures, and 3D models), and assemble them into a coherent
    whole, forming a game world that works by a unified logic. Unity is an amazing
    program. The latest version is free for most people to download and use, and it
    works well with many other programs, including free software such as GIMP and
    Blender. This book focuses on the Unity engine and how it can be used in a practical
    context for making playable and fun games. No prior knowledge of Unity is expected,
    although some knowledge of programming and scripting (such as JavaScript, ActionScript,
    C, C++, Java, or C#) would be beneficial. Let's now take a look at what this book
    covers, on a chapter-by-chapter basis.

    by looking at concrete examples that result in real-world playable games. Specifically,
    it focuses on the implementation of four distinct projects divided across eight
    chapters, two chapters per project. Let''s take a look at what these projects
    are:'

    Coin Collection Game – Part 1*, begins our journey into Unity by creating a first-person
    collection game. This is a great starting point if you''re totally new to Unity
    and are ready to create your first game.'

    chapter and brings a closure to our project, leading neatly to the next chapter.'

- en: 'This book contains almost everything you need to follow along. Each chapter
    considers practical, real-world projects for learning Unity, and includes companion
    files which can be downloaded and used. The only thing you need, apart from this
    book and your concentration, is a copy of the latest version of Unity. At the
    time of writing, this is Unity 5.3.1\. This software is available for free as
    a personal edition, and can be downloaded from the Unity website, here: [https://unity3d.com/](https://unity3d.com/).
    In addition to Unity, if you want to create props, character models, and other
    3D assets, you''ll also need 3D modeling and animation software, such as 3DS Max,
    Maya, or Blender; you''ll also need image editing software, such as Photoshop
    or GIMP. Blender can be downloaded and used for free here: [http://www.blender.org/](http://www.blender.org/).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is ideally suited to readers with no prior experience of Unity or
    game development and who are considering game development as a hobby or a career.
    You will typically have some basic knowledge of programming or scripting, perhaps
    in contexts outside game development, in languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript,
    ActionScript, Python, or another object-oriented language. In addition, you should
    have at least some basic idea of core game development concepts; for example,
    I'll assume you know what a 3D model is, what a texture is, what an audio file
    is, and what an executable file is. I take these concepts to be foundational.
    They will be touched upon on this book briefly, but not elaborated on or explained
    in depth. Here, we'll focus on Unity as software, as a tool for building real-world
    games. Each chapter reads as an in-depth tutorial, assembling a functioning product
    that you can expand upon and play.
