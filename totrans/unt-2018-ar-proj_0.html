<p class="mce-root">Welcome to <em>Unity 2018 Augmented Reality Projects</em>. This book is designed for programmers looking to step out of their comfort zones and take the leap into learning about <strong>Augmented Reality</strong> (<strong>AR</strong>) and how to create projects within Unity with it. We will focus on Android, iOS, and Windows devices and dive deep into understanding the fundamentals of getting started with this amazing and ever-growing technology.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">To get the most out of this book</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To get the most out of this book, you should have some knowledge of the Unity Editor, UI, and build processes. In addition to this, it is highly advised that you have some skill with C# that is above the beginners' level, as this book does not go into how to write C# code. Lastly, it is suggested that you should have, at the very least, taken a look at other programming languages, such as Swift, Objective-C, C, C++, and Java, and are able to get the gist of what is happening with the code that you will encounter in this book at a glance.</p>
<p>The only requirements are basic knowledge of the Unity Game Engine and C#, as they are the primary focuses of this book.</p>
