    disappear (only to be revived or reinvented 15 years later), and big publishers

    Microsoft, and Nintendo keep fighting for their share of the console pie. Exclusively
    handheld consoles are on the back foot, quick being replaced by phones and tablets.
    The mobile industry itself is all but dominated by Google''s Play Store and Apple''s
    App Store and while the mobile market keeps on growing, it has become much, much
    harder for small developers to break through and make a profit. User acquisition
    is extremely challenging (read: expensive) and lack of support from the platform
    holder can sink your profitability. Premium (paid-for) mobile games are a minority,
    and most financially successful products are what we consider freemium or free
    to play. In this crowded market, games are becoming more and more expensive to
    make, market, and operate. What worked in 2010 works no more; the best bet for
    small groups of indie devs is now with Steam, though that market has also been
    flooded with the introduction of the now-defunct Steam Greenlight. According to
    the data exposed by [`http://steamspy.com/`](http://steamspy.com/), there were
    379 games published on Steam in 2012; by 2016, that number grew to 4,207\. Developers
    now face a market that''s increasingly hit-driven, and unless you sit on a billion-dollar
    brand such as FIFA or Call of Duty, playing it safe is no longer an option. If
    you do not adapt and innovate quick enough, you''re sure to face commercial failure.
    As the stakes go higher, teams either balloon out of proportion or grow ever leaner.'

    Greenlight的引入而变得拥挤。根据[`http://steamspy.com/`](http://steamspy.com/)公开的数据，2012年Steam上发布了379款游戏；到2016年，这个数字增长到4,207款。开发者现在面临的是一个越来越以热门产品为导向的市场，除非你拥有像FIFA或使命召唤这样的十亿美元品牌，否则保守的做法不再是选择。如果你不能快速适应和创新，你肯定会面临商业失败。随着赌注的提高，团队要么不成比例地膨胀，要么变得越来越精简。

    outside of your core responsibilities that you'd like to improve, and often it's

    work and tries to sneak things past the quality assurance team. I am simply asking
    you to be very proactive and constantly seek opportunities to improve things.
    The difference between good and great is that extra attention that often wasn't
    planned for and isn't necessarily part of the original specification. When things

    without a designated designer is a very risky one. With the freedom of distributed
    design (colloquially called design by committee) often comes a lack of ownership
    and accountability. Making good design decision becomes increasingly difficult
    as the game is being pulled in different directions and lacks a cohesive vision.
    In such teams, even the most pressing gameplay issues can go unaddressed. Everyone
    loves to chip in with their ideas, but nobody feels compelled to work on design

    are an assembly of independent cells. Each cell is a small team consisting of
    a producer, a few artists and coders, at least one tester, a generalist game designer
    and potentially a monetization/live operations-oriented person. People rotate
    in and out of their cells slowly as games are kicked off or killed (canceled).
    Each team can also count on support from a stable of people who work for the whole
    company, taking care of player analytics, finance, social media, operations, customer
    support, marketing, user acquisition, and more. The goal of Supercell's structure

- en: Since this process allows for no iteration, its use in games development is
    highly limited. It can, however, be applied on a small scale, be it on a part
    of game's content (asset production) or a single game feature with already proven
    mechanics and rock-solid specification. Applying waterfall on the whole product
    (with unproven mechanics and systems) would most likely result in a broken game
    that ticks all the boxes but is not fun to play at all.

- en: Creating a highly polished and fine-tuned work of art is not easy, which is
    why games benefit greatly from extensive iteration. These iterative cycles are
    at the core of the Agile methodology of software development. The Agile Manifesto
    ([`http://agilemanifesto.org`](http://agilemanifesto.org/)), which popularized
    the movement, has led to the development of several frameworks; Scrum is one of
    the most popular in the games industry.

  zh: 敏捷（Scrum）传统上最适合10-15人的团队；对于更大的团队，有修改后的版本，如大规模敏捷（Large-Scale Scrum）和Scrum of
    Scrums。
- en: Scrum itself usually relies on sprints (development cycles) that last a few
    weeks (usually between one and three), as well as short daily standup meetings
    (where relevant progress is being shared). Longer development cycles can be used
    but anything spanning more than four weeks hampers the iterative process and becomes
    very hard to plan. Flexibility is a core tenet of Scrum, and it has to be preserved
    by adhering to short (but still meaningful) sprint cycles.

  zh: Scrum 本身通常依赖于持续几周（通常在1到3周之间）的冲刺（开发周期），以及短期的每日站立会议（在这些会议中，相关进度正在被分享）。虽然可以使用较长的开发周期，但任何超过四周的周期都会阻碍迭代过程，变得非常难以规划。灵活性是Scrum的核心原则，必须通过遵守短（但仍然有意义）的冲刺周期来保持。
- en: In Scrum, a product owner (usually the producer) represents the interests of
    an end user and ensures that all development tasks are divided into a set of comprehensive
    tickets.

  zh: 在Scrum中，产品负责人（通常是制作人）代表最终用户的利益，并确保所有开发任务都分为一组综合票据。
- en: Tickets are virtual reminders of the work you have to do. Most teams use online
    ticket and bug tracking systems such as Jira, which offer easy to use dashboards
    and manage everything, from feature and content creation tasks to bugs and issues
    that come out of testing. Work done in each sprint cycle has to be properly tracked
    as tickets so it can be planned and tested.

- en: A task to create a resource trading feature would probably take the shape of
    a user story (a task that's described from the point of view of the end user),
    starting with As a player, I can easily trade resources with my guildmates...
    and would be followed by a detailed set of functionalities and acceptance criteria,
    and possibly paired with a user interface mockup or a link to a relevant design
    document. These tasks are placed in the product backlog and wait for the end of
    the current development cycle. The backlog itself is a database of all tasks and
    bugs. It's usually handled by tracking software such as Jira and requires regular
    oversight from the production staff (including the designer).

  zh: 创建资源交易功能的任务可能采取用户故事（从最终用户的角度描述的任务）的形式，开始于“作为一个玩家，我可以轻松地与我的公会成员交易资源...”，然后会跟随详细的功能集和验收标准，并可能配对用户界面原型或相关设计文档的链接。这些任务被放置在产品待办事项中，等待当前开发周期的结束。待办事项本身是所有任务和错误的数据库。它通常由Jira等跟踪软件处理，并需要生产人员（包括设计师）的定期监督。
- en: On top of using software dashboards, many teams opt for a physical sprint board
    often placed on an actual office wall or a large whiteboard. The sprint board
    is where all relevant tasks end up, often in the form of sticky notes. Bugs rarely
    live on these boards as they are too small to track with such scrutiny. Moreover,
    bugs rarely follow the workflow of new feature and improvement tickets.

  zh: 除了使用软件仪表板外，许多团队选择使用物理冲刺板，通常放置在真正的办公墙上或大型的白板上。冲刺板是所有相关任务最终到达的地方，通常以贴纸的形式出现。错误很少出现在这些板上，因为它们太小，无法用如此严格的审查来跟踪。此外，错误很少遵循新功能改进票据的工作流程。
- en: 'A physical sprint board is a great visual indicator and serves as the epicenter
    of daily standup meetings, where people working on each task share their progress

    boards are divided into four columns: to do, in progress, testing, and done.'

- en: The sprints themselves can consist of multiple phases. For example, in a game
    that has already been released, a three-week sprint might have two weeks of development
    (after which all features are locked into place) and a week fully dedicated to
    bug fixing, testing, and a store submission of the improved version of the game.
    Each sprint formally ends with a retrospective and starts with a planning meeting.
    During sprint planning, any upcoming tasks are pulled from the backlog, estimated
    by their respective disciplines, and slotted into the newsprint.

  zh: 冲刺本身可以由多个阶段组成。例如，在一个已经发布的游戏中，为期三周的冲刺可能有两周的开发（在此之后，所有功能都锁定到位）和一周完全致力于修复错误、测试以及改进版本游戏的商店提交。每个冲刺正式以回顾会结束，并以规划会议开始。在冲刺规划期间，任何即将到来的任务都会从待办事项中提取出来，由各自的学科进行估算，并安排在新闻纸上。
- en: Game designers working in Agile teams will greatly benefit from their iterative
    nature and increased flexibility, but only if they stay diligent! Once the development
    cycle begins, it is unlikely you'll be able to sneak in extra feature work. Any
    improvements and ideas you'd like to put into the game will have to be turned
    into concise and actionable tickets and brought to everyone's attention during
    sprint planning or backlog grooming (a regular analysis of all open tickets).
    Design documents and spreadsheets will rarely be seen by your teammates unless
    you include them in the tickets themselves.

    costs and increasing the chances of finishing the product on spec and on time.
    Unfortunately, big design pivots, unforeseen technical issues, licensing problems,
    and financial pressures are commonplace in our industry. Experienced producers
    always push for a buffer of an additional 15-25% development time on each milestone,
    and quite often that still isn't enough.

    It''s a common practice to start the project with the aim of spending the first
    several months on creating a so-called Vertical Slice. Vertical Slices are essentially
    demo versions of the main game hoping to showcase its potential, prove the artistic
    vision, and validate basic gameplay mechanics. Think of them as vertical slices
    of a cake: it may cover a very small area of the final product but contains all

    hits. To allow for a high cancellation rate (especially in the early stages of
    the development) is to enable your team to take more risks and be creative. It's
    also important to give the teams the power to kill their product, rather than
    to have that decision flow from senior executives—the former is empowering and
    inspiring, the latter antagonizes and demotivates. If the decision has been made
    well into production, a postmortem presentation should follow. The aim of the

    improving existing games, or coming up with new ideas and prototypes. If new games
    are the focus, the lineup of game concepts and prototypes is voted on by the wider
    company. Ideas that are popular and deemed viable are then expanded upon and taken
    into preproduction, or put in the backlog awaiting a more suitable time. The key

- en: 'Market sizing: This validation phase usually includes market research (looking
    into industry trends and competition) as well as testing our idea for a brand
    and potential user acquisition costs. To do the latter, we will often create a
    set of test advertising campaigns using a few potential art styles and brands
    for our game. The game will only pass if there''s space for the product in the
    market and potential user acquisition costs are acceptable. It''s possible to
    delay market sizing and begin the work on the internal prototype, but ultimately,
    all games need to make sure they can acquire an audience if needed.'

  zh: 市场评估：这个验证阶段通常包括市场研究（研究行业趋势和竞争）以及测试我们为品牌和潜在用户获取成本的想法。为此，我们通常会创建一系列测试广告活动，使用几种潜在的艺术风格和品牌为我们的游戏。只有当产品在市场上有所空间且潜在用户获取成本可接受时，游戏才能通过。可以推迟市场评估并开始内部原型的制作，但最终，所有游戏都需要确保在需要时能够吸引观众。

    to develop and playtest the game. The difference here is that Alpha builds can
    be used to gather external validation. This only happens if the team itself decides
    to seek real-world insight into certain aspects (such as experimental controls
    or multiplayer code). In such cases, a test version of the game will be released
    in a small territory, often with a placeholder name and under the umbrella of
    a brand new publishing name. The only way to test unknown quantities is to release
    the game to a real market and see how it fares. As everything is subject to extensive
    changes and most of the game will still be missing, these early versions of the
    game do not allow for any in-app purchases and are not ready to provide real insight
    into important stats such as user retention.'

- en: It's possible that a game project you'll be working on will have a publisher
    other than your studio. The relation between the publisher and the studio can

- en: Whatever the relation to the developer, the publisher will not only release
    the product under its own name and market it, they are also very likely to cover
    all of the costs of development. Deals and royalty structures vary greatly, but
    in most cases, publishers are the ones who keep the cash flowing between all involved
    parties and are the ones who are set to gain (or lose) the most. Publishing can
    get very complex; sometimes more than one studio will work on a single game, other
    times an external owner of an intellectual property (IP) will be involved (the
    IP itself can be a brand, a book, video game, or movie universe).

  zh: 无论与开发者的关系如何，出版商不仅会以自己的名义发布产品并对其进行营销，他们也很可能承担所有开发成本。交易和版税结构差异很大，但在大多数情况下，出版商是那些在所有相关方之间保持现金流并有望获得（或损失）最多的一方。出版业务可能非常复杂；有时不止一个工作室会参与制作同一款游戏，有时知识产权（IP）的外部所有者也会参与（IP本身可以是品牌、书籍、视频游戏或电影宇宙）。
- en: When a publisher is engaged in the project, the detailed milestone structure
    mentioned previously will be of paramount importance as it will carry financial
    outcomes for the developer. Publishers will have to approve the GDD and provide
    feedback on each and every milestone; this can, of course, limit the flexibility
    of the developer, but it will also help ensure the project stays on track and
    has a chance of being released. Sometimes, publishers also take care of initial
    ideation and seed the game pitch to the developer.
