- en: Mobile applications have revolutionized the way we communicate and interact
    with each other, and their development is now beginning to reach a certain level
    of maturity. To support the development of mobile apps, there are now many tools
    and environments available.

- en: Xamarin is a toolset that has seen increasing success in recent years and is
    gaining more and more interest, particularly from development shops that have
    a significant investment in .NET and C# resources. Xamarin wraps each platform's
    native APIs with a C# wrapper, allowing the developer to interact with the environment
    in essentially the same way as any native developer would. As Xamarin apps are
    developed in C#, a whole new possibility of sharing code across platforms comes
    into play with all the associated benefits and challenges.

- en: As companies look to adopt Xamarin, new Xamarin developers will be required;
    where do they come from? In many cases, there will be existing seasoned mobile
    developers who are already familiar with Android and iOS development.

- en: 'That''s where this book comes in; the idea being to provide a quick path for
    developers already familiar with Android and/or iOS development so they can get
    up to speed with Xamarin development. To that end, this book does not focus on
    the basics of developing Android and iOS apps; rather, we focus on teaching experienced
    Android and iOS developers how to develop apps using Mono, C#, and the Xamarin
    suite of tools. Specifically, we focus on the following topics:'

    I was no fan of Objective-C, but when did C# become the cross-platform tool of
    choice? I always had a lot of respect for what the Mono team accomplished, but
    I generally had the view that Microsoft would eventually prohibit C# and .NET
    from being terribly successful on any platform that they did not own. Being a
    Star Wars fan, and somewhat of a geek, I was reminded of a conversation from Episode
    III. If you recall a certain scene between Anakin and Palpatine, where Anakin
    realizes Palpatine knew the dark side of the force; just replace the dark side
    of the force with Xamarin and you get Palpatine turning to you saying: "Xamarin
    is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural." That''s pretty
    much the feeling I had; was I selling out to learn a cross-platform set of technologies
    that would eventually completely tie me to Windows?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two years later, I feel fairly comfortable answering that question as no! Obviously,
    we work in a dynamic industry and things can change in an instant, but the technology
    world is in a different place than it was 10 years ago, and cross-platform C#
    and .NET seem to play in Microsoft's favor now. So, the strange feeling has been
    diminished with success, and seeing how the relationship between Microsoft and
    Xamarin has only gone from strength to strength, I am encouraged.
  prefs: []

- en: If you are coming from an Objective-C or Java background, you will likely have
    the same feelings from time to time, but if you give the tools a chance I think
    you will be amazed.
