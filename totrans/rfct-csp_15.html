<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Most developers have worked in environments where they are unable to pay down technical debt, not due to the technical difficulty of the task, but because of organizational priorities, fears, urgent deadlines, and a lack of clear understanding of the full impact of technical debt on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">their software.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">In this chapter, we’ll explore some of these factors that can prevent you and your team from resolving technical debt and introduce some ways of helping the organization understand and value the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">refactoring process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">We’re going to cover the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">main topics:</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-319"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Overcoming barriers to refactoring</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">When I speak with developers in the technical community, almost everyone has stories of being told that they were not allowed to spend time refactoring </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">their code.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Sometimes this mandate </span><a id="_idIndexMarker876"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">came from upper management and sometimes from product management or someone involved in the agile process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">However, just as often, the directive would come from engineering leadership such as a team lead or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">engineering manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">The reasons for this can vary by the organization and project you’re working on, but some common reasons include </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">There’s an urgent deadline and the team must focus on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">meeting it</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Refactoring the code isn’t perceived to provide any </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">business value</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">The change would be to a risky area of the application with a lot of technical debt and there’s a risk of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">introducing bugs</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Developers are told “Don’t worry about the quality of the code; this is just a prototype and won’t go into production” (it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">usually will)</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">The team is assured “Don’t worry about the quality of the code; we’re going to completely rewrite this application” (you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">usually won’t)</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Let’s talk about some</span><a id="_idIndexMarker877"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1"> of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">these objections.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-320"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">Urgent deadlines</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">The “we’re on a deadline” objection is a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker878"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1"> very common one for many teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.2">Sometimes, teams are truly on a critical deadline that can’t be missed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.3">During these times, it can often be “all hands on deck,” with people working in high-stress environments and typically working late hours as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.4">When this is the case, spending time to address technical debt can be disruptive to the team and its chances of meeting </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">the deadline.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">In other words, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">sometimes, this objection is a legitimate one that makes sense for the business during a specific and limited period </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">of time</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">However, these high-urgency time periods cause technical debt to accumulate at a very high rate since developers aren’t given the time to do things the right way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">While a team may be able to achieve amazing things in a short period of time, these things are rarely accomplished in a way that results in maintainable code that will stand the test </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">of time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Additionally, many organizations flow from urgent deadline to urgent deadline, causing long stretches of time where the team accumulates technical debt at a staggering rate while not being able to pay </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">it down.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Sometimes deadlines cannot be altered or avoided, such as deadlines for the end of a fiscal year or a trade show or other conference. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">It can also be strategically beneficial to accumulate technical debt in the short term in return for meeting key business objectives that need to happen before a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">specific date.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">However, it is your responsibility as a software engineer or engineering leader to clearly, succinctly, and regularly communicate technical debt and its impact to management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">Once management adequately understands the obstacle, you must then work with them on long-term remediation steps and scheduling of the work needed for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">that effort.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">We’ll talk more about this remediation process later in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">this chapter.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-321"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">“Don’t touch high-risk code”</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">The objection that certain portions of code are too brittle to touch more than needed, so we shouldn’t improve them, is a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker879"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> laughable one when you think about it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">After all, if code has decayed to the point where you’re afraid to even try to improve it, the need for refactoring is likely one that has been postponed for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">some time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">While this code is dangerous to touch, not refactoring it could lead to disastrous results when the team is finally forced to make a change to it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">Let’s examine the argument against refactoring </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">this code.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">The core concern in this case is often a combination of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">following fears:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Touching this code is likely to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">introduce bugs</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">We don’t understand how this code </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">should</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1"> work</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">There are no tests that would catch defects that might </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">be introduced</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">I find that this objection often occurs after key people leave a team and nobody else has any knowledge of a complex area that those individuals maintained. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">The code in question usually has little to no documentation and very few unit tests, if any are present </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">at all.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">These concerns don’t mean you can’t successfully improve or replace the code in question. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">In fact, some of the strategies we talked about in </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Part 2 </span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">of this book around testing code can significantly help with the fears behind </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">this objection.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">First, you can write unit tests around the code you’re changing before you make any changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">Some of the advanced testing tools we explored in </span><a href="B21324_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor189"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Chapter 9</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1"> such as Snapper and Scientist .NET can help </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">with this.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Deploying software in phased rollouts or with the option of rolling back can also help alleviate some fears, as we’ll see in </span><a href="B21324_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor354"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Chapter 17</span></em></span></a><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">, Agile Refactoring</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1"> when we talk about things such as feature flags and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">blue/green deployments.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">“This code is going away, don’t spend time on it”</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">The objection that specific code is temporary and you shouldn’t worry about its quality typically occurs either at the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">beginning</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1"> of software projects, during prototyping phases, or at the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">end</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1"> of software projects, when you’ve determined whether you must replace or retire the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">entire</span></span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker880"/></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1"> application.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">This often occurs when a team wants to test out a concept by building a quick “throwaway” prototype that can explore a concept or prove that a course of action </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">is viable.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Unfortunately, many “throwaway” prototypes survive to become the foundation of a future application, despite being built for speed in proving a concept and having been designed intentionally to not worry about performance, security, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">or reliability.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">A good prototype can get people so excited about the project that the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">may occur:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">They forget they’re not dealing with “real” software and that the prototype was intended to be a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">temporary “throwaway”</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">They view the functionality provided in the prototype as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">already complete</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">The project gets an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">urgent deadline</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">While there are certainly valid arguments that promoting a throwaway prototype to a real application is a symptom of mismanagement, let’s talk about productive things that members of the development team can do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">about this.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">First, understand that your “throwaway” prototypes have a good chance of being viewed as working pieces of software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">Some teams use rough styling or sketch-style user interfaces, such as the one in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Figure 15</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">.1</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">, to help others remember the application is just </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">a prototype:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Second, you can treat all code as production code deserving of refactoring, tests, and documentation, reducing your prototyping speed accordingly and somewhat defeating the idea of putting together a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">quick prototype.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Third, in the event that a throwaway prototype is promoted to an operational piece of software, the first pieces of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker881"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">work should be around reworking the prototype as needed to serve as the basis for the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">application’s future.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">End-of-life applications</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">The other time that code is viewed as non-permanent is when the application you’re developing is either at the end of its lifespan and about to be retired, or when people decide that the current level of technical debt requires a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">complete rewrite.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">In the case when applications truly are end-of-life and will not be maintained for much longer, the technical debt may not be a critical problem – assuming the application actually does go offline in the near future. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">In this case, the team should know roughly when the application will go offline and this date should be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">confirmed regularly.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">Tip</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">It is important to check in regularly with management on the end-of-life status of the application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">If the deactivation date is postponed or the decision to retire the application entirely seems less sure, you can change your posture to be more aggressive in your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">refactoring efforts.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">If you have an application that has so much technical debt that you believe it cannot be solved without a rewrite, be very careful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">I have seen many teams assume that their application will be retired and replaced by a successor, only to see the rewrite get delayed farther and farther down the road or even </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">canceled entirely.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">If you are depending on a rewrite to end your technical debt, I strongly recommend you have an estimated date for when that rewrite will start and when the old project will be retired. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">While software estimation can be challenging (as numerous books on the topic demonstrate), it is irresponsible to not improve your existing codebase without a believable timeline for</span><a id="_idIndexMarker882"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1"> the replacement </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">coming online.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">I have seen dozens of software projects over the last 20 years as a software engineer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">Over that time, I have only seen two projects get completely rewritten. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.3">One of these projects was due to a technical necessity since its technology would no longer function past a certain date and the other involved extraordinary efforts by a lead engineer who was frustrated by maintaining the old version of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">the application.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">You and your team will be better off if you assume that a complete rewrite will not happen and instead focus on paying down technical debt piece </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">by piece.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">We’ll talk more about strategies for gradually renewing and replacing applications in </span><a href="B21324_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor354"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">Chapter 17</span></em></span></a><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">, </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">Agile Refactoring</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">“Just do the minimum required”</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">Occasionally, you’ll hear something to the effect of “Why are you spending all this time refactoring or testing? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">Just do the work required to complete </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">the task.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">These statements can arise from a few </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">different causes:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">The project being </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">behind schedule</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">A lack of trust in the development team due to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">past delays</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">A lack of understanding of the importance </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">of refactoring</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">Whenever I encounter this objection, I think of a camping analogy I’ve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">heard before.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">When you go camping, you are expected to leave the campsite as good as you found it or slightly better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">At the campsite, you are expected to not leave your trash strewn about, even though it is faster to do so than to spend time cleaning up after yourself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.3">This is sometimes called the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">Boy </span></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">Scout Rule</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">Secondly, if you go camping and you find your campsite to be a mess, it is entirely rational to spend </span><a id="_idIndexMarker883"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">some time cleaning up the campsite instead of setting up your tent on top of a pile </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">of garbage!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">Applying this analogy to development, when you go to make a change, you may need to modify some areas of your code that are not up to current standards, not tested, or in need of cleanup in general. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">It is not unreasonable for changes to a file to include fixes to other unrelated pieces </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">of work.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">Let’s say you are working on a small set of changes that affect a number of places throughout your application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">You discover that one of those places has a significant amount of technical debt and likely needs several days of cleanup work to meet current standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.3">In this case, the appropriate thing to do would be to implement the small change in that area and talk about the additional refactorings needed during your next stand-up meeting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.4">Often, the team will create a new separate work item for that larger </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">refactoring effort.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">Here, the organization typically would focus on the second item because its overall risk score of 3.15 is higher than the 2.7 risk score of the first item, meaning it represents a larger threat to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">the organization.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">These conversations can be stressful and represent a critical turning point in software projects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.2">In these high-stakes</span><a id="_idIndexMarker899"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1"> conversations, your goal is to communicate the following things succinctly </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">and respectfully:</span></span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">Note that your goal here </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">isn’t</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1"> to get them to agree to what you are proposing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.2">Your goal is to get them to understand the issue and work with you on determining when and how it should </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">be resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">When your focus is on</span><a id="_idIndexMarker900"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1"> getting your way at all costs, this can result in a loss of trust, growing hostilities between development and management, and a feeling that developers cannot think in terms of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">business needs.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">Instead, if you view your partners in management as having legitimate insights and value to add to the organization, the conversation can become something different – a partnership where engineering and management work together for both the long-term and short-term needs of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">the business.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-334"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">Setting up the conversation</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">Before you can even have a conversation about the problem, you need to be able to effectively communicate the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker901"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">problem and the scope of its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">potential solutions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">This will take some consideration and planning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.2">You don’t need to have a detailed project plan in place for this, but you do need to think through the scope of the project, the pieces that will need to change, and the people who will need to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">be involved.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">You’ll also need to consider your team’s current projects and what the people you’re looking to involve are currently working on, or slated to be working </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">on soon.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">Remember that for your organization to say “yes” to your refactoring effort, they’ll need to say “no” to something else for the duration of your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">refactoring effort.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">Once you have a sufficient understanding of the scope of the problem and its solution, you should bring it to management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">This can be done either as part of a regular check-in meeting between engineering leadership and management or as its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">own meeting.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">How you approach the meeting invite will depend on the individual </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">you’re approaching.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">Some leaders may be receptive to you stopping by their office or sending them a direct message and saying something to the effect of “I have some concerns about the project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.2">Do you have 30 minutes sometime to talk about this in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">more detail?”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">On the other hand, other leaders will want to have the conversation as soon as you broach the topic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.2">For this reason, I recommend you prepare for the conversation and find a time when their calendar </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">appears clear.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-335"><a id="_idTextAnchor334"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">Anticipating questions and objections</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">As you present your concerns and options to management, you should keep in mind the types of questions or objections they might raise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.2">Be prepared to drill into the technical details of the current</span><a id="_idIndexMarker902"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1"> problem as well as your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">proposed solutions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">It’s also typical for management to want details on project timelines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.2">This can include not only how long you expect the refactoring effort to take, but also </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">how long the project can wait to </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">be started</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">Remember that most organizations have major projects tentatively scheduled for at least the next quarter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.2">Taking on a refactoring effort typically requires rearranging current and planned work in other areas. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.3">As an example, look at </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">Figure 15</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">.3</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1"> for a sample breakdown of major initiatives by quarter for the web, services, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">integration teams:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">While the integration team may want to spend time in Q2 working on a piece of technical debt, doing so would risk the services team’s planned work on connecting to a new vendor and potentially delay the integration team’s own planned paid services work, both slated to begin </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">in Q3.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">Be honest about the urgency of the issues your team is facing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.2">Sometimes the answer is that it can wait, but the longer it is delayed the greater the penalty the team faces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.3">At other times, refactoring efforts are needed to resolve urgent and already pressing issues the team is encountering with the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">current system.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">Additionally, keep in mind the background of the person you’re talking to and the people they talk to. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.2">If you’re talking to a very security-oriented person and you haven’t thought through the security ramifications of your change, that conversation is likely not going to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">go well.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">You don’t need to have an answer for every question you are asked, and it is acceptable to say “I don’t know; let me look into that and get back </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">to you.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">The bottom line is that changes to project schedules are serious matters and if you appear to have not taken the time to think about the most obvious concerns, it will not inspire confidence </span><a id="_idIndexMarker903"/><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1">among management.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-336"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">Different approaches for different leaders</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">I’ve met a lot of different people in management and it’s amazing how different two skilled leaders can be from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1">one another.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">Some leaders are extremely </span><a id="_idIndexMarker904"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">analytical and incredibly data-driven, wanting to pore over reports and spreadsheets. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.2">Others are people-oriented and driven not as much by raw numbers as they are by </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">specific stories</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1"> of how something affects </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">specific individuals.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">For leaders focused on the overall data, I usually present key metrics and highlight interesting findings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.2">I often provide all relevant data to them for further analysis, either preemptively or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">upon request.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">An example metric might be that we spent 15 hours over the last 3 sprints dealing with this problem, or that 15% of the bugs from the last quarter could be traced back to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">this area.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">As far as sharing specific stories goes, I usually come prepared with two or three examples of how a problem impacts developers, end users, or other relevant stakeholders. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.2">This might be something such as “Last sprint, Priya tried to work on a new feature we thought would only take a few hours, but because of how this is architected, it actually took her 3 days,” or “Garret is a very competent developer, but he tried to modify this area of code and it wound up causing this critical production bug due to the code’s lack </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">of maintainability.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">An approach that works well with one individual may have very little impact on a different person. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.2">As a result, I find it best to have a few interesting metrics and a few relevant scenarios whenever I have these critical conversations on major </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">refactoring efforts.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-337"><a id="_idTextAnchor336"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">The importance of communication</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">One thing I hope you’ve picked up on in this chapter is that while you want to resolve technical debt, your goal is the short-term and long-term success of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">the organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">This means that any conversation about technical debt should be a two-way conversation where both parties listen to each other and can have their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">voices heard.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">Sometimes, the legitimate </span><a id="_idIndexMarker905"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">short-term needs of a business are to ship something as fast as possible or to meet a deadline with an external partner </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">or agency.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1">As an engineering leader, your goal is to ensure management understands the impact, urgency, and risk that technical debt represents and the importance of both small and large refactoring efforts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.2">However, your focus is typically on the code, while management’s focus is centered on strategic initiatives or even simply keeping the business afloat and the lights on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.3">Both roles and their perspectives are critically important to a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">healthy organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">At the end of the day, what you’re really after is open and honest communication between engineering and management where management can appreciate the risk and impact of technical debt and engineering can understand the pressures facing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">the organization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">This communication starts with trust and respecting the contributions that management brings to the table in terms of steering the overall organization toward its goals and balancing priorities and needs that often compete with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">one another.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-338"><a id="_idTextAnchor337"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1">Case study – Cloudy Skies Airlines</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">As we close the chapter, let’s look at our case study from Cloudy </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1">Skies Airlines.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">Brian, a lead developer, has been investigating a growing number of problems with the reservation and payment </span><a id="_idIndexMarker906"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">processing part of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">the application.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">These issues, initially thought to be isolated, seem to occur during peak usage times when many customers are trying to book flights or modify their existing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">flight reservations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1">After investigating, Brian and his team discover that the problems are related to the current design and architecture of the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.2">While the system could handle the old number of users, it is simply not able to adequately scale to handle peak workloads given its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">current inefficiencies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">Ordinarily, such a system could be scaled out to have multiple servers running in parallel with a load balancer distributing traffic between them (see </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">Figure 15</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">.4</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">):</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">However, the system</span><a id="_idIndexMarker907"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1"> was not designed to support multiple copies of the application running at once without </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">significant rework.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1">While the team is able to make some short-term performance and stability improvements to resolve the current issues, they understand that as the business grows, these problems will just resurface – particularly in peak </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">travel seasons.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">After careful consideration, the team comes up with a plan that would allow the system to run multiple copies in parallel but would require a significant amount </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">of rework.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">One of the engineers also suggests potentially moving from a model where the server does all the work and returns a successful response to the user to a model where the request is quickly validated and then put in a queue for processing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.2">This approach would handle spikes in incoming requests but would require changes to how request processing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">currently works.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">Armed with these ideas and knowledge of the scope of the current problem and possible fixes, Brian schedules a meeting with Maddie, the Chief </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">Technology Officer.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.1">During the meeting, Brian lays out the performance problem, the recent steps the team has taken to restore service, and the likelihood that it will occur again as the business grows and peak </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.1">seasons approach.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">Once Brian is sure Maddie understands the basics of the problem, he gives an overview of the two possible remediation plans, as well as his personal recommendation to stick with the relatively simpler change of working to allow the application server to support multiple copies </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1">in parallel.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1">Maddie asks several technical questions about scalability, particularly around why the current system is unable to have multiple copies running at once. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.2">After Brian explains the problems that would cause, Maddie understands the reasoning and the need for remediation and the conversation shifts </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1">toward</span></span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker908"/></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1"> scheduling.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">We also talked about communicating technical debt to management, particularly the idea of technical debt being viewed as a risk to the organization’s systems and productivity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.2">We also introduced the idea of using a risk register to track technical debt over time and improve the visibility of technical debt </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">to non-developers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1">We closed with a discussion about prioritizing technical debt, getting permission from management for larger refactoring projects, and the importance of trust, communication, and establishing a partnership with management in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">remediation effort.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1">In the next chapter, we’ll explore the value of code standards in terms of minimizing technical debt over time and how to choose an existing standard or build </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1">your own.</span></span></p>
