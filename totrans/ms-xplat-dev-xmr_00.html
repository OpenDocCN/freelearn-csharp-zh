The emergence of the Xamarin development platform created a new development niche, serving products to a variety of platforms at the same time while letting users adapt their existing .NET development skills to these new platforms and produce applications for a wider range of devices and operating systems. Thanks to Xamarin, developers are now enjoying a new era where development efforts don't target only a single application platform, but span multiple devices including smart phones, tablets, personal computers, and even wearable devices, creating highly efficient native applications.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Developing with Xamarin">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Developing with Xamarin</em>, provides an insightful look at the Xamarin framework and architecture on target platforms.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to build the sample project and make use of the code samples in this book, you will need a Xamarin.iOS and/or Xamarin.Android subscription, depending on the platform you want to target. Most of the diagnostic tools used are distributed as part of the development SDKs for the target platforms. As a development IDE, you will need Visual Studio 2013 (or higher) or Xamarin Studio if you are using or configuring a Windows based development environment, but only Xamarin Studio otherwise. For testing and diagnostics, real mobile devices or SDK-provided emulators can be used.</p></div>
