- en: In this chapter, we'll first consider the existing controls that **Windows Presentation
    Foundation** (**WPF**) offers us and look at how we can use them to create the
    layouts that we require. We'll investigate the many ways that we can modify these
    controls to avoid the need to create new controls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll examine the various levels of functionality that are built into the existing
    controls and then discover how to best declare our own controls when required.
    We'll take an in-depth look at the various options that we have and determine
    when it's best to use each one. Let's jump straight in and take a look at the
    various layout controls.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a wide range of controls included in .NET Framework. They cover most
    common scenarios and it is rare that we will need to create our own controls in
    a typical form-based application. All of the UI controls tend to have their functionality
    built up from a large number of common base classes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All controls will share the same core-level base classes that provide the core-level
    functionalities and then a number of derived framework-level classes that provide
    the functionality that is associated with the WPF Framework, such as data binding,
    styling, and templating. Let's take a look at an example.

    also have an inheritance hierarchy, with each successive base class offering some
    additional functionality. Let''s look at the `Button` class as an example. Here
    is the inheritance hierarchy of the `Button` control:'

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: As with every object in .NET Framework, we start with the `Object` class, which
    provides low-level services to all classes. These include object comparison, finalization,
    and the ability to output a customizable `string` representation of each object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next is the `DispatcherObject` class, which provides each object with thread
    affinity and associates them with a `Dispatcher` object. The `Dispatcher` class
    manages a prioritized queue of work items for individual threads. Only the thread
    that the associated `Dispatcher` object was created on can access each `DispatcherObject`
    directly and this enables derived classes to enforce thread safety.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the `DispatcherObject` class, we have the `DependencyObject` class, which
    enables all derived classes to use the WPF property system and declare Dependency
    Properties. The `GetValue` and `SetValue` methods that we call to access and set
    their values are also provided by the `DependencyObject` class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next up is the `Visual` class, which has the primary role of providing rendering
    support. All elements that are displayed in the UI will extend the `Visual` class.
    In addition to rendering each object, it also calculates their bounding box and
    provides support for hit testing, clipping, and transformations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Extending the `Visual` class is the `UIElement` class, which provides a number
    of core services to all of its derived classes. These include the event and user
    input systems and the ability to determine the element's layout appearance and
    rendering behavior.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following on from that is the `FrameworkElement` class, which provides the first
    framework-level members, building upon the foundation of the core-level classes
    that it extends. It is the `FrameworkElement` class that enables data binding
    through the `DataContext` property and styling through the `Style` property.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also provides events that relate to an object's lifetime, an upgrade of the
    core-level layout system to a full layout system and improved support for animations,
    among other things. This is typically the lowest-level class that we might want
    to extend if we were creating our own basic elements, as it enables derived classes
    to partake in the majority of the WPF UI capabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Control` class extends the `FrameworkElement` class and is the base class
    for most of the WPF UI elements. It provides appearance templating through the
    use of its `ControlTemplate` functionality and a host of appearance-related properties.
    These include coloring properties, such as `Background`, `Foreground`, and `BorderBrush`,
    along with alignment and typeface properties.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Extending the `Control` class is the `ContentControl` class, which enables controls
    to have one object of any CLR type as its content. This means that we can either
    set data objects or UI elements as the content, although we may need to provide
    a `DataTemplate` for the data objects if they are of a custom type.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final class in the long line of parent classes that the `Button` class extends
    is the `ButtonBase` class. In fact, this is the base class for all buttons in
    WPF and it adds useful functionality for buttons. This includes automatically
    converting certain keyboard events to mouse events, so that users can interact
    with the buttons without using a mouse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Button` class itself adds little to its inherited members with only three
    related `bool` properties; two that specify whether a button is the default button
    and one that specifies whether the button is a cancel button. We'll see an example
    of this shortly. It has an additional two protected overridden methods that get
    called when the button is clicked or when an automation peer is created for it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While WPF enables us to modify existing controls to such a degree that we rarely
    need to create our own, it is important to be aware of this inheritance hierarchy
    so that we can extend the appropriate and most lightweight base class that fulfills
    our requirements when we need to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if we wanted to create our own custom button, it would typically
    make more sense to extend the `ButtonBase` class, rather than the `Button` class,
    and if we wanted to create a totally unique control, we could extend the `FrameworkElement`
    class. Now that we have a good understanding of the make-up of the available controls,
    let's see how they are displayed by the WPF layout system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Laying it on the line
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In WPF, the layout system is responsible for attaining the sizes of each element
    to be displayed, positioning them on screen, and then drawing them. As controls
    can be contained within other controls, the layout system works recursively, with
    each child control's overall position being determined by the position of its
    parent panel control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The layout system first measures each child in each panel in what is known as
    a measure pass. During this pass, each panel calls the `Measure` method of each
    child element and they specify how much space they would ideally like to have;
    this determines the `UIElement.DesiredSize` property value. Note that this is
    not necessarily how much space they will be given.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the measure pass comes the arrange pass, when each panel calls the `Arrange`
    method of each child element. During this pass, the panels generate the bounding
    boxes of each of their child elements, dependent upon their `DesiredSize` values.
    The layout system will adjust these sizes to add any required margins or additional
    adjustments that may be needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It returns a value to the input parameter of the panels' `ArrangeOverride` method
    and each panel performs its own specific layout behavior before returning the
    possibly adjusted value. The layout system performs any remaining required adjustments
    before returning execution to the panel and completing the layout process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need to be careful when developing our applications to ensure that we do
    not unnecessarily trigger additional passes of the layout system, as this can
    lead to poor performance. This can occur when adding or removing items in a collection,
    applying transforms on the elements, or by calling the `UIElement.UpdateLayout`
    method, which forces a new layout pass.
  prefs: []

- en: Containing controls
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The existing controls can mostly be split into two main categories: those that
    provide layout support for other controls and those that make up the visible UI,
    and are arranged in it by the first category of controls. The first category of
    controls are of course panels and they provide a variety of ways to arrange their
    child controls in the UI.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some provide resizing capabilities, while others don't, and some are more efficient
    than others, so it's important to use the right panel for the job at hand. Additionally,
    different panels offer different layout behaviors, so it is good to know what
    the available panels are and what they each offer us in terms of layout.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All panels extend the abstract `Panel` class, and that extends the `FrameworkElement`
    class so it has all of the members and functionality of that class. However, it
    doesn't extend the `Control` class and so it cannot inherit its properties. It
    therefore adds its own `Background` property to enable users to color the gaps
    between the panel's various items.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Panel` class also provides a `Children` property that represents the items
    in each panel, although we do not typically interact with this property unless
    creating a custom panel. Instead, we can populate this collection by simply declaring
    our child elements directly within the panel element in XAML.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are able to do this because the `Panel` class specifies the `Children` property
    in a `ContentPropertyAttribute` attribute in its class definition. While the `Content`
    property of a `ContentControl` normally enables us to add a single item of content,
    we are able to add multiple items into panels because their `Children` property,
    which is set as the content, is a collection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another `Panel` class property that we might need to use is the `IsItemsHost`
    property, which specifies whether a panel is to be used as a container for the
    items of an `ItemsControl` element, or not. The default value is `false`, so it
    makes no sense to explicitly set this property to `false`. In fact, it is only
    ever required in a very particular situation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'That situation is when we are replacing the default panel of an `ItemsControl`,
    or one of its derived classes, such as a `ListBox`, in a `ControlTemplate`. By
    setting this property to `true` on a panel element in a `ControlTemplate`, we
    are telling WPF to place the generated collection elements in the panel. Let''s
    see a quick example of this:'

    the `ItemsControl` element with a horizontal `StackPanel`. Note that this is a
    permanent replacement and no one can make further changes to this without providing
    a new `ControlTemplate`. There is however a far easier way to achieve the same
    result and we saw an example of this in [Chapter 4](2eb41601-2339-4ac5-96bc-b87aa99eb157.xhtml),

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In this alternative example, we simply provide a new `ItemsPanelTemplate` for
    the `ItemsControl` through its `ItemsPanel` property. Using this code, the internal
    panel can still be easily changed without the need to provide a new `ControlTemplate`
    and so when we don't want other users to be able to swap out the inner panel,
    we use the first method, otherwise, we use this method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Panel` class also declares a `ZIndex` Attached Property, which can be used
    by child elements to specify a layered order within the panel. Child elements
    with higher values will appear above, or in front of, elements with lower values,
    although this property is ignored in panels that do not overlap their children.
    We'll see an example of this in the next section, so let's now focus on the panels
    that derive from the `Panel` class and what they offer us.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Canvas` class enables us to explicitly position child elements using combinations
    of the `Canvas.Top`, `Canvas.Left`, `Canvas.Bottom`, and `Canvas.Right` Attached
    Properties. This is vaguely similar to the old Windows Forms system of control
    placement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Instead, we tend to use them more for displaying shapes, constructing graphs,
    showing animations, or drawing applications. Take the following example:'

    bottom ones are from two other canvas instances. They are all contained within
    a parent canvas element with a black background. The three inner canvases are
    spaced to give the effect that they each have a border. They have been declared
    in the order of top-left, top-right, bottom, and the last element to be declared
    is, the middle circle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The left circle is being drawn in the top-left canvas and we can see where it
    is overlapping the canvas' apparent bottom border, which shows that it is not
    being clipped by its parent canvas. However, it is being clipped by the lower
    canvas element and this demonstrates that UI elements that are declared later
    will be displayed over the top of earlier declared elements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nevertheless, the second canvas to be declared is clipping the middle circle,
    which was the last declared element. This demonstrates that setting the `Panel.ZIndex`
    property on an element to any positive number will position that element above
    all others that have not explicitly set this property. The default value for this
    property is zero, so an element that has this property set to `1` will be rendered
    on top of all elements that have not explicitly set a value for it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next element to be declared is the bottom rectangle and the right circle
    is declared within it. Now, as this element is declared after the top canvases,
    you might expect that the right circle would overlap the upper-right canvas. While
    this would normally be the case, this won't happen with our example for two reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first, as we've just found out, is because the upper-right panel has a higher
    `ZIndex` property value than the lower panel and the second reason is because
    we have set the `UIElement.ClipToBounds` property to `true`, which is used by
    the `Canvas` panel to determine whether it should clip the visual content of any
    children that may lie outside the bounds of the panel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is commonly used with animations, to enable a visual to be hidden out of
    the panel bounds and then slid into view in reaction to some event. We can tell
    that the right circle has been clipped by its parent panel because we can see
    its apparent top border, which is outside its bounds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last element to be declared is the middle circle and we can see that, apart
    from the overlapping canvas element with the higher `ZIndex` property value, it
    overlaps all of the other elements. Note that the `Canvas` panel does not perform
    any kind of resizing on its children, so it is not typically used for generating
    form type UI.

    of the panel. The remaining space is normally filled by the last child that does
    not explicitly set one of the `Dock` property. However, if that is not the behavior
    that we want, then we can set the `LastChildFill` property to `false`.
  prefs: []

    dimensions are specified, either explicitly using the `Width` and `Height` properties,

    typical UI controls. It is the most versatile and enables us to perform a number
    of tricks to end up with the layout that we require. It offers a flexible row-
    and column-based layout system that we can use to build UIs with a fluid layout.
    Fluid layouts are able to react and change size when users resize their application
    windows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    depending on the space available, which makes it one of the most performance-intensive
    panels. Therefore, if we don't need the functionality that it provides, we should
    use a more performant panel, such as a `Canvas` or `StackPanel`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The children of a `Grid` panel can each set their `Margin` property to be laid
    out using absolute coordinates, in a similar fashion to the `Canvas` panel. However,
    this should be avoided wherever possible, because that will break the fluidity
    of our UI. Instead, we typically define our desired layout using the grid's `RowDefinitions`
    and `ColumnDefinitions` collections and the `Grid.Row` and `Grid.Column` Attached
    Properties.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While we can again hard code exact widths and heights for our rows and columns,
    we usually try to avoid doing so for the same reason. Instead, we generally take
    advantage of the grid's sizing behavior and declare our rows and columns, predominantly
    using one of two values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    second is the default `*` star-sized value, which takes all of the remaining space.

    the most important data, which is/are set to `*`.

    `Grid` panel with three columns and two rows. Note that a single star-sizing is
    used as the default width and height values for the `ColumnDefinition` and `RowDefinition`
    elements respectively; we do not need to explicitly set them and can simply declare
    empty elements. Also note that star-sizing will only work when the `Grid` panel
    has some size set on it, as we have done here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, in our example, the second and third columns and the first row will
    use star-sizing and take all of the remaining space. The first column also uses
    star-sizing, however, it specifies a multiplier value of `2.5`. As such, it will
    be provided with two and a half times the amount of space that the other two columns
    will each have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    columns to the correct position. While the `TextBlock` element is declared in
    the first column, it does not only reside in that column, because it has also
    specified the `Grid.ColumnSpan` Attached Property, which allows it to spread out
    across multiple columns. The `Grid.RowSpan` Attached Property does the same for
    rows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to specify which cell they should be rendered in. However, the default value for
    these properties is zero and so, when we want to declare an element within the
    first column or row of the panel, we can omit the setting of these properties,
    as has been done for the `TextBlock` in our example.

    to `true`, which enables users to invoke it by pressing the *Enter* key on their
    keyboards. It is also responsible for the blue border on the button and we can
    use this property to style the default button differently in our own templates. The Cancel button
    sits next to it in the third column and sets the `IsCancel` property to `true`,
    which enables the users to select it by pressing the *Esc* key on their keyboards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that we could have set the lower `RowDefinition.Height` property to `26`
    instead of setting that on each button explicitly and the end result would have
    been the same, as the `Auto` value would be calculated from their height anyway.
    Also, note that the `Margin` property has been set on a few elements here for
    spacing purposes only, rather than for absolute positioning purposes.

    elements of the inner `Grid` panels.

    and the definition elements that specify the `SharedSizeGroup` property are outside
    that template then it will not work. It will, however, work in the opposite direction.

    the `ContentControl` class specifies the `Content` property in a `ContentPropertyAttribute`
    attribute in its class definition and this enables us to set the content by simply
    declaring the child element directly within the control in the XAML. This attribute
    is used by the XAML processor when it processes XAML child elements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    property to specify a particular format for it. Otherwise, we can use the `ContentTemplate`
    property to specify a `DataTemplate` to use while rendering the content. Alternatively,
    the `ContentTemplateSelector` property is of type `DataTemplateSelector` and also
    enables us to select a `DataTemplate`, but based upon some custom condition that
    we may have. All derived classes have access to these properties in order to shape
    the output of their content.

    having to specify a custom template. Let's move on to the next section now, where

    It is actually used internally within `ContentControl` objects to present their
    content.
  prefs: []

    time that we should declare these elements is within a `ControlTemplate` of a

    declare them where we want the actual content to appear.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the `ContentControl` class and also enable us to select a `DataTemplate` based
    upon a custom condition. Like the `Content` property, both of these properties
    will also be implicitly data bound to the properties of the same names in the
    templated parent if the `TargetType` property of the `ControlTemplate` has been
    set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    although there are a few controls where the names of the relevant properties do
    not match up. In these cases, we can use the `ContentSource` property as a shortcut
    to data bind the `Content`, `ContentTemplate`, and `ContentTemplateSelector` properties.
  prefs: []

    a property named `Header` on the `ContentControl` object to implicitly data bind

    the `ContentTemplate` and `ContentTemplateSelector` properties.

    If the `ContentTemplate` or `ContentTemplateSelector` property is set, then the
    data object specified by the `Content` property will have the resulting data template

    the scope of the `ContentPresenter` element, it will be applied.
  prefs: []

    is returned from a type converter, then it will be set as the `Text` property
    of a `TextBlock` control and that will be displayed. Likewise, all other objects

    we'll now take a closer look at this control. In the simplest terms, an `ItemsControl` class
    contains a variable number of `ContentPresenter` elements and enables us to display
    a collection of items. It is the base class for most common collection controls,
    such as the `ListBox`, `ComboBox`, and `TreeView` controls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each of these derived classes adds a specific look and set of capabilities,
    such as a border and the notion of a selected item. If we do not require these
    additional features and simply want to display a number of items, then we should
    just use the `ItemsControl`, because it is more efficient than its derived classes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    bind a collection that implements the `IEnumerable` interface from our View Model
    to the `ItemsControl.ItemsSource` property. However, there is also an `Items`
    property that will reflect the items in the data bound collection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To clarify this further, either property can be used to populate the collection
    of items to display. However, only one can be used at a time, so if you have data
    bound a collection to the `ItemsSource` property, then you cannot add items using
    the `Items` property. In this case, the `Items` collection will become read-only.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    interface, then we will need to add them using the `Items` property. Note that
    the `Items` property is implicitly used when items are declared as the content
    of an `ItemsControl` element in XAML. However, when using MVVM, we generally use
    the `ItemsSource` property.
  prefs: []

    implicitly be wrapped in a `ContentPresenter` container element. The type of container
    element will depend upon the type of collection control used. For example, a `ComboBox`

    that we provide are targeted to the correct type of container control. For example,
    if we were using a `ListBox`, then we would need to provide a style targeting
    the `ListBoxItem` type, as in the following example.

    in what is known as an adorner layer. Adorner elements in this layer will always
    be rendered on top of the normal WPF controls, regardless of their `Panel.ZIndex`
    property setting. Each adorner is bound to an element of type `UIElement` and
    independently rendered in a position that is relative to the adorned element.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of the adorner is to provide certain visual cues to the application
    user. For example, we could use an adorner to display a visual representation
    of UI elements that are being dragged in a drag and drop operation. Alternatively,
    we could use an adorner to add handles to a UI control to enable users to resize
    the element.
  prefs: []

    the parent of the adorner, rather than the adorned element. In order to create
    a custom adorner, we need to declare a class that extends the `Adorner` class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When creating a custom adorner, we need to be aware that we are responsible
    for writing the code to render its visuals. However, there are a few different
    ways to construct our adorner graphics; we can use the `OnRender` or `OnRenderSizeChanged`
    methods and a drawing context to draw basic lines and shapes, or we can use the
    `ArrangeOverride` method to arrange .NET controls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Adorners receive events like other .NET controls, although if we don't need
    to handle them, we can arrange for them to be passed straight through to the adorned
    element. In these cases, we can set the `IsHitTestVisible` property to `false`
    and this will enable pass-through hit-testing of the adorned element. Let's look
    at an example of a resizing adorner that lets us resize shapes on a canvas.

    as this is the only place that it will be used. Inside the class, we declare the
    `VisualCollection` object that will contain the visuals that we want to render
    and then the visuals themselves, in the shape of `Thumb` controls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've chosen `Thumb` elements because they have built-in functionality that
    we want to take advantage of. They provide a `DragDelta` event that we will use
    to register the users' mouse movements when they drag each `Thumb`. These controls
    are normally used internally in the `Slider` and `ScrollBar` controls to enable
    users to alter values, so they're perfect for our purposes here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We initialize these objects in the constructor, specifying a custom cursor and
    a different `DragDelta` event handler for each `Thumb` control. In these separate
    event handlers, we use the `HorizontalChange` or `VerticalChange` properties of
    the `DragDeltaEventArgs` object to specify the distance and direction of the mouse
    movement that triggered the event.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We use these values to move and/or resize the adorned element by the appropriate
    amount and direction. Note that we use the `Math.Max` method and the value `6`
    in our example to ensure that the adorned element cannot be resized smaller than
    the size of each `Thumb` element and the `Stroke` size of each adorned element.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the four `DragDelta` event handlers, we find two different ways to render
    our adorner visuals. In the first method, we use the `DrawingContext` object that
    is passed into the `OnRender` method by the base class to manually draw shapes.
    This is somewhat similar to the way that we used to draw in the `Control.Paint`
    event handler methods when using `Windows.Forms`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this overridden method, we draw a rectangle that surrounds our element and
    is four pixels bigger than it in both dimensions. Note that we define a transparent
    background for the drawing brush, as we only want to see the rectangle border.
    Remember that adorner graphics are rendered on top of the adorned element, but
    we do not want to cover it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the `ArrangeOverride` method, we use .NET Framework to render our `Visual`
    elements using their `Arrange` methods, as we would in a custom panel. Note that
    we could just as easily render our rectangle border in this method using a `Rectangle`
    element; the `OnRender` method was used in this example merely as a demonstration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this method, we simply arrange each `Visual` element at the relevant position
    and size in turn. Calculating the appropriate positions can be achieved simply
    by dividing the width or height of each adorned element in half and subtracting
    half of the width or height of each thumb element.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we get to the protected overridden `VisualChildrenCount` property and
    `GetVisualChild` method. The `Adorner` class extends the `FrameworkElement` class
    and that will normally return either zero or one from the `VisualChildrenCount`
    property, as each instance is normally represented by either no visual, or a single
    rendered visual.

    albeit most commonly, just temporarily. All of them extend the `TriggerBase` base
    class and therefore inherit its `EnterActions` and `ExitActions` properties. These
    two properties enable us to specify one or more `TriggerAction` objects to apply
    when the trigger becomes active and/or inactive respectively.

    define one or more property setters that should occur when a certain condition
    is met, the `EventTrigger` class does not. Instead, it provides an `Actions` property
    that enables us to set one or more `TriggerAction` objects to be applied when
    the trigger becomes active.

    the `TextBlock` element will be data bound to another View Model property named
    `ErrorList`, which could output a description of the validation errors.

    layout the address controls and notice that the `SharedSizeGroup` property is
    set on the `ColumnDefinition` element that defines the label column. This will
    enable the column sizes within this control to be shared with externally declared

    `Address` property of the control, rather than setting the `DataContext` property.
    As the control's internal controls are data bound using `RelativeSource` bindings,
    which specify their own binding source, they do not require any `DataContext`
    to be set. In fact, doing so in this example would stop it from working.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using WPF, we can generally create the UI that we want using the many techniques
    already discussed in this book. However, in the cases where we require a totally
    unique control with both a custom drawn appearance and custom functionality, then
    we may need to declare a custom control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developing custom controls is very different than creating `UserControl` elements
    and it can take some time to master this. To start with, we will need to add a
    new project of type WPF Custom Control Library to declare them in. Also, instead
    of having a XAML page and a code behind file, we only have the code file. At this
    point, you may be wondering where we define what our control should look like.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, when defining a custom control, we declare our XAML in a separate file
    named `Generic.xaml`, which is added by Visual Studio when we add our controls
    project. To clarify, the XAML for all of the custom controls that we declare in
    this project will go into this file. This does not relate to controls that extend
    the `UserControl` class and we should not declare those in this project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This `Generic.xaml` file gets added into a folder named `Themes` in the root
    directory of our WPF Custom Control Library project, as this is where the Framework
    will look for the default styles of our custom controls. As such, we must declare
    the UI design of our control in a `ControlTemplate` and set it to the `Template`
    property in a style that targets the type of our control in this file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The style must be applied to all instances of our control and so the style is
    defined with the `TargetType` set, but without the `x:Key` directive. If you remember,
    this will ensure that it is implicitly applied to all instances of our control
    that don't have an alternative template explicitly applied.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A further difference is that we cannot directly reference any of the controls
    that are defined within the style in the `Generic.xaml` file. If you recall, when
    we provided a new template for the built-in controls, we were under no obligation
    to provide the same controls that were originally used. Therefore, if we tried
    to access a control from our original template that had been replaced, it would
    cause an error.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, we generally need to access them by overriding the `FrameworkElement.OnApplyTemplate`
    method, which is raised once a template has been applied to an instance of our
    control. In this method, we should expect that our required control(s) will be
    missing and ensure that no errors occur if that is the case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    can be used to monitor CPU activity, RAM usage, audio loudness, or any other regularly
    changing value. We'll first need to create a new project of type WPF Custom Control
    Library and rename the `CustomControl1.cs` class that Visual Studio adds for us
    to `Meter.cs`.

    associated CLR property wrappers and callback handlers. Of particular note is
    the class's static constructor and the use of the `DefaultStyleKeyProperty.OverrideMetadata`
    method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is also added by Visual Studio when adding the class and is required to
    override the type-specific metadata of the `DefaultStyleKey` Dependency Property
    when we derive a custom class from the `FrameworkElement` class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Specifically, this key is used by the Framework to find the default theme style
    for our control and so, by passing the type of our class into the `OverrideMetadata`
    method, we are telling the Framework to look for a default style for this type
    in our `Themes` folder.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you remember, the theme styles are the last place that the Framework will
    look for the style of a specific type and declaring styles just about anywhere
    else in the application will override the default styles defined here.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first Dependency Property is the main `Value` property of the control and
    this is used to determine the size of the visible meter bar. This property defines
    a default value of `0.0` and attaches the `CoerceValue` and `OnValueChanged` callback
    handlers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the `CoerceValue` handling method, we ensure that the output value always
    remains between `0.0` and `1.0`, as that is the scale that we will be using. In
    the `OnValueChanged` handler, we update the value of the other Dependency Property,
    `ClipRect`, dependent upon the input value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To do this, we first cast the `dependencyObject` input parameter to our `Meter`
    type and then pass that instance to the `SetClipRect` method. In this method,
    we calculate the relative size of the meter bar and define the `Rect` element
    for the `ClipRect` Dependency Property accordingly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we see the CLR property wrapper for the `Value` Dependency Property and
    then the declaration of the `ClipRect` Dependency Property. Note that we declare
    it using a `DependencyPropertyKey` element, thus making it a read-only property,
    because it is only for internal use and has no value in being exposed publicly.
    The actual `ClipRect` Dependency Property comes from this key element.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After this, we see the CLR property wrapper for the `ClipRect` Dependency Property
    and then we come to the aforementioned `OnApplyTemplate` method. In our case,
    the purpose of overriding this method is because often, data bound values will
    be set before the control's template has been applied and so we would not be able
    to correctly set the size of the meter bar from those values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, when the template has been applied and the control has been arranged
    and sized, we call the `SetClipRect` method in order to set the `Rect` element
    for the `ClipRect` Dependency Property to the appropriate value. Before this point
    in time, the `Height` and `Weight` properties of the `meter` instance will be
    `double.NaN` (where *NaN* is short for *Not a Number*) and cannot be used to size
    the `Rect` element correctly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When this method is called, we can rest assured that the `Height` and `Weight`
    properties of the `meter` instance will have valid values. Note that had we needed
    to access any elements from our template, we could have called the `FrameworkTemplate.FindName`
    method from this method, on the `ControlTemplate` object that is specified by
    our control's `Template` property.

  type: TYPE_PRE

    Visual Studio adds an almost empty default style that sets a basic `ControlTemplate`
    and targets the type of the class into the `Generic.xaml` file. We just need to
    define our custom XAML within this template.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We start by declaring the `ScaleColors` gradient brush resource within the template.
    Note that the default value for the `Offset` property of a `GradientStop` element
    is `0` and so we can omit the setting of this property if that is the value that
    we want it set to. Therefore, when we see a declared `GradientStop`, like the
    one with the `Color` property set to `LightGreen`, we know its `Offset` property
    is set to `0`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our meter control is basically made up of a `Border` element that surrounds
    a `Rectangle` element. We use `TemplateBinding` elements to data bind the `Background`,
    `BorderBrush`, and `BorderThickness` properties of the `Border` element and set
    its `SnapsToDevicePixels` property to `True` to avoid aliasing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This enables users of the control to specify the border and background colors
    of the internal `Border` element of the meter control from outside the control.
    We could just as easily have exposed an additional brush property to replace the
    `ScaleColors` resource and enable users to define their own meter scale brush.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that we couldn't use a `TemplateBinding` to data bind the `Value` property
    in the `ToolTip` element. This is not because we don't have access to it through
    the template, but because we need to use the `Binding.StringFormat` property and
    the `P` format specifier to transform our `double` property value to a percentage
    value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you remember, a `TemplateBinding` is a lightweight binding and does not offer
    this functionality. While it is beneficial to use it when we can, this example
    highlights the fact that we cannot use it in every circumstance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we come to the all-important `Rectangle` element that is responsible
    for displaying the actual meter bar of our control. The `ScaleColors` brush resource
    is used here to paint the background of the rectangle. We set the `SnapsToDevicePixels`
    property to `true` on this element to ensure that the level that it displays is
    accurate and well-defined.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The magic in this control is formed by the use of the `UIElement.Clip` property.
    Essentially, this enables us to provide any type of `Geometry` element to alter
    the shape and size of the visible portion of a UI element. The geometry shape
    that we assign here will specify the visible portion of the control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our case, we declare a `RectangleGeometry` class, whose size and location
    are specified by its `Rect` property. We therefore data bind our `ClipRect` Dependency
    Property to this `Rect` property, so that the sizes calculated from the incoming
    data values are represented by this `RectangleGeometry` instance, and therefore
    the visible part of the `Rectangle` element.

    meter bar and spoil the effect.
