<p>Azure DevOps is a Microsoft <strong>Software as a S</strong><strong>ervice</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>) platform that enables you to deliver continuous value to your customers. By creating an account there, you will be able to easily<span> </span>plan your project, store <span>your code </span>safely, test it, publish the solution to a staging environment, and then publish the solution to the actual production infrastructure.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Of course, <span>Azure DevOps</span> is a complete framework and the ecosystem that it provides for<br/>
software development is currently available. The automation of all the steps involved in software production ensures the continuous enhancement and improvement of an existing solution in order to adapt it to market needs. </p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><span>You can start the process moving in your Azure portal. If you don't know how to create an Azure portal account, then please check <a href="14b5c5da-4042-439e-9e5a-2e19ba4c4930.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture</em>. </span>The steps to create an Azure DevOps account are quite simple:</p>
<ol>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Select <span class="packt_screen">Create a resource</span> and then <span class="packt_screen">DevOps Project</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/0bb2e952-9c3d-4ec9-a014-b2ac7f3b9dc4.png" style="width:56.42em;height:49.25em;"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>As soon as you start the wizard for creating the project, you can choose how you want to deliver your system from several different platforms. This is one of the greatest advantages of Azure DevOps as you are not limited to Microsoft tools and products, but you can from all common platforms, tools, and products available on the market:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/88a26d74-f288-44f3-b0a9-d3d0a371f961.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="3">
<li>The options available will depend on the platform chosen in the first step. In some cases, you can choose from several deployment options, as you can see in the following screenshot, which appears if you select the <span class="packt_screen">.NET</span> platform:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/76e11a43-9b8e-4a88-8895-6950366f7ac7.png"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Once the setup is complete, you will be able to manage the project using the project portal according to the information you provided. It is worth mentioning that this wizard will create an Azure DevOps Service if you do not have one. The Azure DevOps organization is where you can organize all of you<br/>
Azure DevOps projects. <span>The whole process takes less than 20 minutes</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d23628fd-50d5-415b-8e82-7e5cda97f824.png" style="width:38.17em;height:37.17em;"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>After that, you will be able to start planning your project. The following screenshot shows the page that appears once the Azure DevOps project creation is complete. I<span>n the remainder of this book, w</span>e will come back to this page several times to introduce and describe various useful features that ensure a faster and efficacious deployment:</li>

<p>DevOps is a <strong>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment</strong> (<strong>CI/CD</strong>) methodology, that is, a set of best practices on how to apply continuous improvements to a software application and how to deliver them to the production environment. Azure DevOps is a powerful tool whose range of applications encompasses all the steps involved in both the initial development of an application and in its subsequent <span>CI/CD process.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Azure DevOps contains tools for collecting requirements and for organizing the whole development process. They can be accessed by clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Boards</span> menu in the Azure DevOps page and will be described in more detail in the next two sections:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/aeaf61e6-9ec3-4739-836b-373b4b95bf2d.png" style="width:7.67em;height:17.17em;"/></p>
<p>All other functionalities available in Azure DevOps are briefly reviewed in the following subsections. They will be discussed in detail in <a href="c707cf13-3616-4788-8f39-687bd1cb7c7b.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, <em>Testing Your Code with Unit Test Cases and TDD</em>, to <a href="e61b3c5d-3abd-4442-9c9c-e12fd3acedcc.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>, <em>Automation for Software Testing</em>.</p>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Repos</span> menu item gives you access to a Git repository in order to place the project code:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a9b2f212-5f28-4b8d-8df0-08bce2ef787b.png" style="width:7.67em;height:16.83em;"/></p>
<p>You can connect to this repository from inside Visual Studio in a very simple way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Visual Studio and ensure you are logged in to Visual Studio with the same Microsoft account used to define your DevOps project (or used to add you as a team member).</li>
<li>Prepare a Visual Studio solution containing the Visual Studio projects you need in your application (further projects can be added during development) i<span>f your DevOps project repository is empty</span>.</li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Select the <span class="packt_screen">Team Explorer</span> tab and then click the connection button:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c0fca1ee-8026-4583-9dcc-8f1579360299.png" style="width:22.00em;height:18.50em;"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Connect...</span> link of <span class="packt_screen">Azure DevOps</span>, you will be driven to connect with one of your Azure DevOps projects.</li>
<li>Click the Team Explorer <span class="packt_screen">Home</span> button. Now, you will see commands for performing Git operations and for interaction with other Azure DevOps areas:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/53bda670-8b1f-4794-b35c-451cbbad6a7a.png" style="width:19.42em;height:12.25em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="6">
<li>Commit the solution you just created by clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Changes</span> button i<span>f the Azure DevOps repository is empty</span> and then following the subsequent instructions. </li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Sync</span> button to synchronize your local repository with the remote Azure DevOps repository. If the remote repository is empty and you just created a solution, this action will initialize the remote Azure DevOps repository with this solution; otherwise, this action will download the remote repository on your local machine.</li>
<li>Once all team members have initialized both their local machine repositories and the Azure DevOps repository with the preceding steps, it is enough to open Visual Studio. The solution created in your local repository will appear in the bottom area of the <span class="packt_screen">Team Explorer</span> window.</li>
<li>Click the window to open the solution on your local machine. Then, synchronize with the remote repository to ensure the code you are modifying is up to date.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Team Explorer</span> menu enables you to execute most Git commands, to launch remote builds (<span class="packt_screen">Builds</span> button) and to interact with other Azure DevOps areas (see, for instance, the <span class="packt_screen">Work Items</span> button).</p>

<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Artifacts</span> menu handles the software packages used by the project. There, you may define feeds for basically all types of packages such as NuGet, Node.js, and Python. Once in the <span class="packt_screen">Artifacts</span> area, you may create several feeds by clicking the <span class="packt_screen">+ New Feed</span> link, where each feed can handle several kinds of packages:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/18d082aa-6eee-4b29-b31a-60f26dfc9696.png" style="width:26.33em;height:20.25em;"/></p>
<p>If you select the option to connect to packages from public sources, as a default, the feed connects to <kbd>npmjs</kbd>, <kbd>nuget.org</kbd>, and <kbd>pypi.org</kbd>. However, you can go to the upstream sources tab in the <span class="packt_screen">Feed settings</span> section through the menu in the upper-right corner and remove/add package sources:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9e8a421b-0634-4b20-99e4-679ef66afeae.png"/></p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Connect to feed</span> link of each feed shows a window that, for each package type, <span>explains</span> how to do the following things:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Upload private packages to the feed. This way each team can use its private package's code base.</li>
<li>Connect to the feed to use its packages from Visual Studio. You should add all the project feeds to your Visual Studio feeds in order to also use the private team packages uploaded in the feed; otherwise, your local build will file.</li>
<li>Manage credentials to access the feed:</li>
</ol>

            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Test Plans</span> section allows you to define the test plans you want to use and their settings. It can be accessed through the <span class="packt_screen">Test Plans</span> menu item:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6857dc53-f333-4cb4-8ab5-24251e039eba.png" style="width:8.33em;height:14.00em;"/></p>
<p>Here, you may define, execute, and track test plans made of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual acceptance tests</li>
<li>Automatic unit tests</li>
<li>Load tests</li>
</ul>
<p>Automatic unit tests must be defined in test projects contained in the Visual Studio solution and based on a framework such as NUnit, xUnit, and MSTest (Visual Studio has project templates for all of them). <span class="packt_screen">Test Plans</span> gives you the opportunity to execute these tests on Azure and to define the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A number of configuration settings</li>
<li>When to execute them</li>
<li>How to track them and where to report their results in the overall project documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>For manual tests, you may define complete instructions for the operator, the environment in which to execute them (for example, an operating system), and where to report their results in the project documentation. You can also define how to execute load tests, how to measure results, and where to report them.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Pipelines are automatic action plans that specify all steps from the code build until the software deployment is in production. They can be defined in the pipelines area, which is accessible through the <span class="packt_screen">Pipelines</span> menu item:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8d574ea9-3e7c-424a-9c24-ff9e19182ba8.png" style="width:9.83em;height:13.58em;"/></p>
<p>There, you can define a complete pipeline of tasks to execute alongside their triggering events, which encompasses steps such as code building, launching test plans, and what to do after the tests are passed.</p>
<p>Typically, after the tests are passed, the application is automatically deployed in a staging area where it can be beta-tested. You can also define the criteria for the automatic deployment in production. Such criteria include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of days the application was beta-tested</li>
<li>Number of bugs found during beta-testing and/or removed by the last code change</li>
<li>Manual approval by one or more managers/team members</li>
</ul>
<p>The criteria decision will depend on the way the company wants to manage the product that is being developed. You, as a software architect, have to understand that when it comes to moving code to production, the safer, the better.</p>

<p>Azure DevOps enables you to document system requirements using <em>work items</em>. Work items are stored in your project <span>as a piece of information that can be assigned to a person. They are classified into various</span> types and may contain a measure of the development effort required, a status, and the development stage (iteration) they belong to.</p>
<p>In fact, DevOps methodology, as an Agile methodology, is made of several iterations and the whole development process is organized as a set of sprints. The <span>work items available depends</span> on the <em>Working Item Process</em> you select while creating the Azure DevOps project. The following subsections contain a description of the most common work item types.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Epics work items</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Imagine you are developing a system made of various subsystems. Probably, you are not going to conclude the whole system in a single iteration. Therefore, we need an <span>umbrella spanning several iterations to encapsulate all features of each subsystem.</span> Each <span class="packt_screen">Epics</span> work item represents one of these umbrellas that can contain several features to be implemented in various development iterations. </p>
<p><span>In the <span class="packt_screen">Epics</span> work item, y</span>ou can define the state and acceptance criteria as well as the start date and target date. Besides, you can also provide a priority and an effort estimate. All of this detailed information helps the stakeholders to follow the development process. This is really useful as a macro view of the project.</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Epics</span> are not available a<span>s a default</span>. They must be enabled in the project's <span class="packt_screen">Team Settings</span> page, which can be reached by clicking the project settings link in the <span>bottom</span><span>-</span><span>left corner of the project page and then selecting </span><span><span class="packt_screen">Team Settings</span>:</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Features work items</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>All of the information that you provide in an <span class="packt_screen">Epics</span> work item can also be placed in a <span class="packt_screen">Features</span> work item. So, the difference between these two types of work items is not related to the kind of information they contain, but to their roles and the focus; your team will get to conclude them. <span><span class="packt_screen">Epics</span> may span several iterations and are hierarchically above <span class="packt_screen">Features</span>, that is, each <span class="packt_screen">Epics</span></span> work items <span>is linked to several children <span class="packt_screen">Features</span>, while each <span class="packt_screen">Features</span> work items must be implement</span><span>ed in a single iteration and is part of a single <span class="packt_screen">Epics</span></span> work items<span>.</span></p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that all work items have sections for team discussions. There, you will be able to find a team member in the discussion area <span>by typing the <kbd>@</kbd> </span><span>character (like in several forum/social applications)</span>. Inside each work item, you can link and attach various information. You may also check the history of the current work item in a specific section.</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Features</span> work items are the places to start recording user requirements. For instance, you can write a <span class="packt_screen">Features</span> work item called <strong>Access Control</strong> to define the complete functionally needed to implement the system access control.</p>

<p>After selecting the <em>Working Item Process</em>, you will know which of these two work items is available<span>. There are minor differences between them, but their purpose is substantially the same. They contain detailed requirements for the <span class="packt_screen">Features</span>, described by the <span class="packt_screen">Features</span> work items they are connected to. More specifically, each Product Backlog/User Story work item specifies the requirements of a single functionality that is a part of the behavior described in its father <span class="packt_screen">Features</span> work items. For instance, in a <span class="packt_screen">Features</span> of system access control, the maintenance of the users and the login interface should be two different User Stories/Product Backlog items. These requirements will guide the creation of other children work items:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tasks</strong>: They are <span>important </span>work items that describe the job that needs to be done to meet the requirements stated in the father <span>Product Backlog items/User Story work item</span>. <span>Task work items can contain</span> time estimates that help team capacity management and overall scheduling.</li>
<li><strong>Test cases</strong>: These items describe how to test the functionality described by the requirements. </li>
</ul>
<p>The number of tasks and test cases you will create for each <span>Product Backlog/User Story work item</span> will vary according to the development and testing scenario you use.</p>

Considering the scenario described in <a href="14b5c5da-4042-439e-9e5a-2e19ba4c4930.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture</em>, we decided to define three <span class="packt_screen">Epics</span> work items, as follows:</p>

<li>As soon as you create a <span class="packt_screen">Feature</span> work item, you will be able to connect it to several Product Backlog work items that detail its specifications. The following screenshot shows the details of a Product Backlog work item:</li>

<li>After that, Task <span>and Test Case </span>work items can be created for each Product Backlog work item. The user interface provided by Azure DevOps is really efficacious because it enables you to track the chain of functionalities and the relations among them:</li>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="5">
<li>As soon as you complete the input for the Product Backlog and Tasks work items, you will be able to plan <span>the project sprints</span> together with your team. The plan view enables you to drag and drop Product Backlog work items to each planned <span class="packt_screen">Sprint</span>:</li>
</ol>

<p>This is how these work items are created. Once you understand this mechanism, you will be able to create and plan any software project. It is worth mentioning that the tool itself will not solve problems related to team management. However, the tool is a great way to incentive the team to update the project status, so you can keep a clear vision of how the project is evolving.</p>
