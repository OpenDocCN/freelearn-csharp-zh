<p>In this chapter, we are going to learn about tools used to perform development tasks for <span>.NET Core 2.0</span>&#160;on Windows and Linux operating systems. Also, we will learn how to set up Linux and virtualization using VirtualBox and Hyper-V. This chapter will cover how to install .NET Core 2.0 and tools for Windows and Linux (Ubuntu). We will learn about the&#160;<strong>virtual machine</strong> (<strong>VM</strong>) setup for Ubuntu and create your first simple .NET Core 2.0 running application code. We will configure the VM to manage your first application. The purpose of this chapter is to get a general idea of the required tools and how to install .NET core 2.0 SDK for Windows and Linux, and give you basic F# understanding.</p>
<p>This chapter will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading the required tools for Windows and Linux</li>
<li>Installing .NET Core 2.0 and tools (Windows)</li>
<li>Setting up an Ubuntu<span>&#160;Linux</span> VM</li>

<p>Microsoft offers the Visual Studio <strong>integrated development environment</strong>&#160;(<strong>IDE</strong>) for developers to develop computer programs for Microsoft Windows, as well as websites, web applications, web services, and mobile applications. Microsoft gives us the choice to pick from four Visual Studio adaptations—Community, Professional, Enterprise, and Code. You can download one of these, depending on your individual prerequisite. How these versions differ from each other is explained next.</p>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads">https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads</a> in the browser of your choice. You will see four choices. Select the Visual Studio product based on your requirements.</p>
<p>All versions of Visual Studio 2017 are available for Windows and Macintosh operating systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Studio Community</strong>:&#160;This is a free, open source version of Visual Studio with limited features. This is for the individual developer.&#160;</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio Professional</strong>:&#160;This version has professional developer tools, services, and subscription benefits for small teams (five members).</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio Enterprise</strong>:&#160;This version supports all Visual Studio features and is meant for end-to-end solution development to meet the demanding quality and scaling needs of teams of all sizes. It is great for enterprise organizations. Some of the key features that come with this version are testing tools, architectural layer diagrams, live dependency validation, architecture validation, code clone detection, IntelliTrace, .NET memory dump analysis, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>:<span>&#160;This is a free, open source version and cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)</span> editor <span>that can be extended with plugins to meet your needs. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, extension support, intellige</span>nt&#160;code&#160;comple<span><span>tion, snippets, and&#160;code&#160;refactoring.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">Make a note that Visual Studio is an IDE, while Visual Studio Code is an editor, just like Notepad is an editor. So Visual Studio Code is much more lightweight, fast, and fluid with great support for debugging and has embedded Git control. It is a cross-platform editor and supports Windows, Linux, and Macintosh. Debugging support is good and has rich IntelliSense and refactoring. Like most editors, it is keyboard-centric. It is a file and folders-based editor and doesn't need to know the project context, unlike an IDE. There is no <span class="packt_screen">File</span> | <span class="packt_screen">New Project</span> support in Visual Studio Code as you would be used to in Visual Studio IDE. Instead, Visual Studio Code offers a terminal, through which we can run dotnet command lines to create new projects.</div>
<p>So, for development in Windows, we can use either of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2017 IDE</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code editor</li>
</ul>
<p>If we choose Visual Studio 2017, all we need to do is download Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 from <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads">https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads</a>. It comes bundled with the .NET Core 2.0 SDK and its templates and so we will be ready for development immediately after installing it. Also with Visual Studio 2017, F# tools automatically get installed once we create an F# project or open an F# project for the very first time. So, the F# development setup is taken care of as well. We will see the installation of Visual Studio 2017 in the <em>Installing .NET Core 2.0 and tools (Windows)</em> section of this chapter.</p>
<p>If we choose Visual Studio Code for development, we need to download Visual Studio Code from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a> and the .NET Core 2.0.0 SDK from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd">https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd</a> . We will look at the installation of Visual Studio Code in the&#160;<em>Installing .NET Core 2.0 and tools (Windows)</em> section o<span>f this chapter.</span></p>

<p>As mentioned in the preceding section, Microsoft Visual Studio Code is a cross-platform editor, and it supports Linux operating systems. So, we are going to use Visual Studio Code to create all the example applications on Linux in this book.</p>
<p>Let's start downloading the tools required to stop our development of .NET Core 2.0 applications on the Linux operating system:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Download Visual Studio Code from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>.&#160;We are going to install the Ubuntu 32-bit version, so we will download the Visual Studio Code 32-bit version. Select the&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Linux x86 .deb</span> stable package for download, as shown in the following image:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="395" width="426" src="assets/bd3b09a2-0088-4160-9a8a-3f0f0d44778d.png"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">If you have a Linux machine handy, you can skip the next download step. If you wish to try development on the Linux platform and have a Windows machine to work with, then the next two steps are for you.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Download VirtualBox from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>. It is Oracle's open source general-purpose full virtualizer. At the time of writing this chapter, the latest version of VirtualBox is 5.1. The version 5.1.26 was released on July 27, 2017. Using this, we will set up a Linux (Ubuntu) virtual machine on the Windows host machine.&#160;Click on <span class="packt_screen">Download VirtualBox</span> <kbd>5.1.</kbd>&#160;It will open a page that has options on <span class="packt_screen">VirtualBox binaries</span>. We can select an option based on the machine on which we are installing it. We are installing it on a Windows machine, so we will click on <span class="packt_screen">Windows hosts</span>. In a similar way, we can select different platforms. On clicking <span class="packt_screen">Windows hosts</span>, it will download the VirtualBox executable <kbd>VirtualBox-5.1.26-117224-Win.exe</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="359" width="703" src="assets/61e988ca-8ed5-44f4-8dc2-d788287dbbb1.png"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">VirtualBox needs the Ubuntu <strong>International Standards Organization</strong> (<strong>ISO</strong>) image to create the Ubuntu VM, so next we need to download the ISO image of Ubuntu.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Download the ISO image of Ubuntu by navigating to <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com">https://www.ubuntu.com</a>. By default, the virtual machine software uses 32-bit Linux, so we will select 32-bit.&#160;<span>Hover over the <span class="packt_screen">Downloads</span> menu and click on the highlighted <span class="packt_screen">Desktop</span> link:</span><span><br/></span></li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="289" width="858" src="assets/06faca8a-c433-4ec0-8eef-95fda0c6567c.png"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">It will take us to the downloads page for the desktop. Click <span class="packt_screen">Download</span> on Ubuntu for the desktop. It will start the download of&#160;Ubuntu 17.04 ISO. An ISO image of approximately 1.5 GB will be downloaded.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Download&#160;.NET Core 2.0 SDK from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/linux">https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/linux</a>:&#160;</li>
</ol>
<div style="color: black;font-size: 1em" class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="544" width="183" src="assets/b1447c9e-07fc-4ddc-bc33-a195c281f2c2.png"/></div>
<p><span>With this, we are done with the downloads for our setup in Linux. In the next section, we will learn how to install and set up these tools.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span><strong>Ubuntu 17.04</strong>: As of writing this chapter, this is the latest version, and its code name is&#160;</span><strong>Zesty Zapus</strong>, r<span>eleased on April 13, 2017. Ubuntu releases carry a version number in the form of <kbd>XX.YY</kbd>, with <kbd>XX</kbd> representing the year and <kbd>YY</kbd> representing the month of the official release. For example, the latest version released in April 2017 is represented by 17 (year) and 04 (month). Ubuntu code names use an adjective animal combination, that is an adjective word followed by the name of an animal, typically one that's unique. At the time of writing, Ubuntu 17.10 is due to be released in October 2017; examples covered here used the Ubuntu 17.04 version.</span></div>

<p>Now that we are done with the downloads, it's time to install. As seen in the last section on Windows, we have two options for development in Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on your choice, you can follow the appropriate installation steps.</p>

<p>Double-click on the executable file downloaded for Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 in the earlier section. This will start the installation. C# comes by default in every Visual Studio installation, so there is nothing to do for C#. Visual Studio 2017 also comes with F# support in all its editions: Community, Professional, and Enterprise. F# is an optional component though. The installer includes it as a selectable workload, or you can select it manually in the <span class="packt_screen">Individual components</span> tab, under the <span class="packt_screen">Development activities</span> category. Select <span class="packt_screen">F# language support</span>:</p>

<p>Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 comes with the .NET Core SDK. Select <span class="packt_screen">.NET Core cross-platform development</span> under <span class="packt_screen">Workloads</span> during the Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 installation:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/0559c9f4-6be3-4749-b440-9e8decac83a9.jpg"/></div>
<p>For other versions of Visual Studio, download the .NET Core 2.0 SDK from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core">https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core</a>, or update Visual Studio to 2017 15.3 and select <span class="packt_screen">.NET Core cross-platform development</span> under <span class="packt_screen">Workloads</span>.</p>

<p>Install Visual Studio Code by double-clicking the Visual Studio Code setup executable from its download location. It's a simple installation for Windows.&#160;<span>Once Visual Studio Code is installed, launch it. The following screenshot shows the user interface layout of Visual Studio Code. It follows the conventional editor style and displays files and folders you have access to on the left side and the code content in the editor on the right side. It can be&#160;roughly divided into seven sections, as shown&#160;in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="419" width="778" src="assets/fe03fcab-ec66-4669-a23e-6cc4927d1e13.png"/></div>
<p>Let's discuss them:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Menu bar</strong>: The standard menu bar for doing various operations in the editor, such as opening a file/folder, editing, viewing and installing extensions, changing themes, debugging, running and configuring tasks, and getting help.</li>
<li><strong>Activity bar</strong>: Groups the most commonly performed activities on the leftmost side of the editor. It lets the user switch between the views. It is customizable and lets the user choose the views to be displayed in the bar, by right-clicking on the bar and selecting/unselecting the views. The bar itself can be hidden in the same way. By default, it has five views, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="320" width="276" src="assets/37501094-9eb2-412c-af94-1c9871a30aa0.png"/></div>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>EXPLORER</strong>: This view lets your browse, open, and manage all the files and folders in your project. You can create, delete, and rename files and folders, as well as move files and folders from here. You can also open the files/folders in Terminal (Command Prompt in Windows) from here by right-clicking and selecting&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Open in Command Prompt</span>. You can find the file/folder location as well from here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SEARCH</strong><span>: This view lets you search and replace globally across your open folder.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SOURCE CONTROL</strong>: This lets you work with Git source control by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DEBUG</strong>: This view displays the breakpoints, variables, and call stack for debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EXTENSIONS</strong>: This is used to install and manage extensions in Visual Studio Code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Side bar</strong>: This contains the view selected from the activity bar.</li>
<li><strong>Command Palette</strong>: As stated earlier, Visual Studio Code is keyboard-centric, so anyone who loves using a keyboard is going to have a great time working on Visual Studio Code. The&#160;<em>Ctrl&#160;</em>+&#160;<em>Shift&#160;</em>+&#160;<em>P</em> key combination brings up what is called a Command Palette. We can access all the functionality of Visual Studio Code from here. To make effective use of Visual Studio Code, it is highly recommended that the reader makes himself/herself well versed with the commands from the help menu item links:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="281" width="483" src="assets/ad6810b3-2259-47e5-a467-02876b7ef96a.png"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Editor</strong>: The editor is where the content of the file is displayed and the user can edit it. Visual Studio Code provides a feature called Split Editor (open to the side in Linux). Go to the&#160;<span class="packt_screen">View</span> menu in the menu bar and select <span class="packt_screen">Split Editor</span> (alternatively you can type the command <em>Ctrl</em> +<em>\</em>). This will create a new editor region, where you can edit a group of files. These regions are called editor groups. The open editors can also be seen in the Explorer view in the sidebar. Visual Studio Code allows up to three editor groups, designated as <span class="packt_screen">LEFT</span>, <span class="packt_screen">CENTER</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">RIGHT<strong>,</strong></span> as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="437" width="806" src="assets/7664a48d-5c8d-4cd1-8f9e-25a63919783f.png"/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Panels</strong>: Displays the <span class="packt_screen">TERMINAL</span>, <span class="packt_screen">OUTPUT</span>, <span class="packt_screen">PROBLEMS</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">DEBUG CONSOLE</span> panes below the editor. To see it in action, go to the&#160;<span class="packt_screen">View</span> menu and click any of the menu items from <span class="packt_screen">PROBLEMS</span>, <span class="packt_screen">OUTPUT</span>, <span class="packt_screen">DEBUG CONSOLE,</span>&#160;and <span>TERMINAL</span>. Alternatively, you can also press their corresponding commands. We will see more on panels when we write our first application.</li>
<li><strong>Status Bar</strong>: Displays information about&#160;the opened project and files being edited, such as errors, warnings, current line and column number, encoding, and file type.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Now we are familiar with&#160;Visual Studio Code, its layout, and basic functionality.</span></p>
<div class="packt_tip">Go to the&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Help</span> menu and explore in detail the features that Visual Studio Code offers. The <span class="packt_screen">Interactive Playground</span> highlights a number of features in Visual Studio Code and also lets you interactively try them out. The&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Help</span> menu also has <span class="packt_screen">Documentation</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Introductory Videos</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Tips and Tricks</span>,&#160;which are very handy.</div>
<p>Remember, Visual Studio Code is an editor and therefore we need to add support for the language we want to work with through extensions. Visual Studio Code is very rich in extensions. For our example and for the purpose of learning .NET Core 2.0, we will install extensions for C# and F#, as we will be working with them.</p>
<p>Let's start with C#, as after a fresh install we do not have support for C# and hence there would be no IntelliSense to work with on the editor. To install C#, let's switch to <span class="packt_screen"><span class="packt_screen">Extension</span>&#160;View</span> and search for <kbd>C#</kbd>. We will choose <span class="packt_screen">C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)<strong>,</strong></span> as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="332" width="441" src="assets/828306d3-72fc-4b35-a66a-a1d348ce5dc0.png"/></div>
<p>Click <span class="packt_screen">Install</span> and then click on&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Reload</span> and Visual Studio Code will start supporting C# along with its IntelliSense.</p>
<p><span>Similarly, search <kbd>F#</kbd> and <span class="packt_screen">Install</span> it. We will be using the&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Ionide-fsharp</span> extension, as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="516" width="438" src="assets/72c491b3-1f54-4104-81b9-3c974e688265.png"/></div>
<p>With Visual Studio Code, we need to install <span class="packt_screen">.NET Core SDK - 2.0.0</span> <span class="packt_screen">(x64)</span> also, as Visual Studio Code doesn't install it. Double-click on the executable of .NET Core 2.0 SDK to install it, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="342" width="892" src="assets/07de42a5-167b-471f-a8d5-7e750de63b49.png"/></div>
<p>And with this, we are done with the installation of our prerequisites for development on the Windows platform. Next, we will set up a Linux (Ubuntu) VM and perform the installation of prerequisites there. If you are using a Windows platform and do not wish to set up a Linux VM, the next section can be skipped.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The Visual Studio Code user interface was developed on the Electron framework, which is an open source framework used to build cross-platform desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The editor is powered by Microsoft's Monaco Editor and gets its intelligence from OmniSharp/Roslyn and TypeScript. As all of these are open source, you can search them and see the source code in GitHub.</div>

<p>In this section, we will see how to set up <span>Linux (</span>Ubuntu) on a virtual machine, so that a Windows user can also develop and test their .NET Core 2.0 applications in Linux. To do so, let’s start with the VirtualBox setup. Oracle provides an open source VirtualBox executable, which we downloaded in the previous section. The following are the steps we need to follow to set up VirtualBox:</p>
<ol>
<li>Double-click on the VirtualBox executable. It will open a wizard. Before installation, click on <span class="packt_screen">Disk usage</span> and check <span class="packt_screen">Disk Space Requirement</span>. It is recommended that the virtual machine for Ubuntu Linux is set up with at least 2 GB RAM and 25 GB free hard drive space. So, instead of choosing the default drive (the&#160;<kbd>C</kbd> drive in our case, where Windows is installed), select another drive if it exists (for example, the&#160;<kbd>D</kbd> drive) so that you can easily allocate more space, and it also prevents any impact on the host operating system.</li>
<li><span>The VirtualBox setup needs approximately 241 MB of disk space to install. It's recommended to create a new folder (for example, <kbd>VirtualBox</kbd>) to easily identify and track the VM.</span>&#160;</li>
</ol>

<p>For Windows machines, we can use Hyper-V to create a Linux virtual machine. Let's start with the basic settings and important configuration changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, enable <span class="packt_screen">Hyper-V Management Tools</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Hyper-V Platform</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Windows Features</span>:&#160;</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>Change the default virtual directory. By default, Hyper-V uses the same drive as that on which the OS is installed but this is not a good practice. We should change the default drive the drive on which the operating system is not installed, such as the&#160;<kbd>D</kbd> drive in our case. &#160;It's a good practice to keep Windows and system files <span>separate&#160;</span><span>from other files. To make configuration changes, open <span class="packt_screen">Hyper-V Manager</span> and then&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Hyper-V Settings</span></span>.<span><span>&#160;Instead of the default selection, change it to some other drive (<kbd>D</kbd> in our case). Create a new folder named <kbd>Virtual Machine</kbd> on this new drive location:</span></span></li>

<ol start="3">
<li>Create a virtual switch. A virtual switch is used to join computers and to create networks. We can create three types for virtual switches:
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">External</span>: An accessible network where the virtual machines are hosted on the same physical computer and all external servers from which the host machine can connect.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Internal</span>:&#160;<span>Creates a virtual switch that can be used only by the virtual machines that run on the same physical computer, and&#160;</span>between virtual machines and the physical computer. An internal virtual switch doesn't provide connectivity to a physical network connection.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Private</span>: Creates a virtual switch that can be used only by the virtual machines that run on the same physical computer.</li>

<p>Let's create our very first .NET Core 2.0 application. We will create it using Visual Studio Code as well as Visual Studio 2017 in Windows, and with Visual Studio Code in Ubuntu.</p>
<p>The .NET Core 2.0 SDK installs the templates for creating the class library, console, web, MVC, razor, web API, and so on, for applications based on .NET Core 2.0. As our first application, we will create a simple MVC application on .NET Core 2.0, and get familiar with the application code and the .NET Core 2.0 command-line integration.</p>
<p>Let's start by creating this application in Windows using Visual Studio 2017, and then we will create the same application from Visual Studio Code, first in Windows and then in Linux.</p>

<p>For this, we need to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Visual Studio 2017.</li>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">File</span> | <span class="packt_screen">New</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Project</span>. In the <span class="packt_screen">New Project</span> dialog, you should see the&#160;<span class="packt_screen">.NET Core</span> template inside <kbd>Visual C#</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c81643bf-0a80-41e3-b8c7-afb300454989.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">.NET Core</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">ASP.NET Core Web Application</span>.</li>
<li>Name the project&#160;<kbd>HelloDotNetCore2</kbd> and click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>It will show a <span class="packt_screen">New ASP.NET Core Web Application</span> dialog. Ensure <span class="packt_screen">.NET Core</span> and <span class="packt_screen">ASP.NET Core 2.0</span> are selected in the two dropdowns displayed in this dialog, as we are discussing .NET Core 2.0 here. The first dropdown signifies the target framework of the application and the second dropdown is the version of ASP.NET Core that we are using. You have the option to choose <span class="packt_screen">.NET Framework</span> as the target framework in the first dropdown, but then the resulting application would not be cross-platform. If the application has to be cross-platform, it should target .NET Core. The second dropdown has the different versions of ASP.NET Core that have been released so far, such as 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0. We will keep it as <span class="packt_screen">ASP.NET Core 2.0</span>. You will also notice that with ASP.NET Core 2.0, the number of templates has increased from the previous version. Apart from <span class="packt_screen">Empty</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Web API</span>, and&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Web Application</span>, which were present in ASP.NET 1.1, we also have templates for <span class="packt_screen">Web Application (Model-View-Controller)</span>, &#160;<span class="packt_screen">Angular</span>, <span class="packt_screen">React.js</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">React.js and Redux</span>. We will choose <span><span class="packt_screen">Web Application (Model-View-Controller)</span></span> as our template. There is support for a Docker container but let's keep it unchecked for the time being. We will discuss Docker in detail in a later chapter. Also, keep the <span class="packt_screen">Authentication</span> as <span class="packt_screen">No Authentication</span>. We will explore authentication options in detail in a later chapter. Click <span class="packt_screen">OK:</span></li>

<ol start="6">
<li>And <em>voila</em>! Visual Studio creates the&#160;<kbd>HelloDotNetCore2</kbd> project for us and restores the required packages to build in the background. You can check this by inspecting the <span class="packt_screen">Package Manager Console</span> output. Your very first ASP.NET Core 2.0 is ready to be run:</li>

<p class="mce-root">Visual Studio is the IDE and is aware of projects and templates. As stated earlier, Visual Studio Code is a file and folder-based editor and hence it is not aware of projects and templates. So to create the same application through Visual Studio Code, we will make use of the .NET command line. Let's get going!</p>
<p>Open Visual Studio Code, go to <span class="packt_screen">View</span>, and click on <span class="packt_screen">TERMINAL</span>. It will open Command Prompt/the PowerShell terminal in the bottom section of Visual Studio Code. If you see the PowerShell terminal, type <kbd>cmd</kbd> so that it turns into Command Prompt. This is an optional step if you are comfortable with PowerShell.</p>
<p>Let's try and explore the commands available to create a new project, so let's type <kbd>dotnet --help</kbd>&#160;. This is the help command for dotnet and will let us know about the options that we have available for creating a .NET Core 2.0 MVC application as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/39ef1123-d7fc-4dfd-a637-78be2ce4bdc0.png"/></div>
<p>The SDK lists all the possible commands and options that can be used with explanations. So keep in mind, any time you need any help with .NET commands, SDK is there to help us. Just ask for help by typing&#160;<kbd>dotnet --help</kbd> in the terminal.</p>
<p>From the command list, it looks like the command of interest to us is the&#160;<kbd>new</kbd>&#160;command, as its description reads that this command initializes .NET projects.</p>
<p>So, let's ask SDK how to use the new command by typing <kbd>dotnet new --help</kbd>. This will let us know the command that we need to run to create a new MVC application:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/05500d06-5272-4274-9b29-70743e27cf50.png"/></div>
<p>Based on the preceding help text, let's enter the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>dotnet new mvc -lang C# -n HelloDotNETCore2</strong></pre>
<p>This will create a new MVC project named <kbd>HelloDotNetCore2</kbd> in the C# language, in the folder named <kbd>HelloDotNetCore2</kbd> at the location of the terminal. Now let's build and run the application by typing the following commands:</p>
<pre><strong>cd HelloDotNetCore2<br/></strong><strong>dotnet build<br/></strong><strong>dotnet run</strong></pre>
<p>The first command navigates to the newly created folder,&#160;<kbd>HelloDotNetCore2</kbd>. Then, we build the application with the second command and run it through the third command. The <kbd>dotnet build</kbd> command is just to show that we have a build command as well. The <kbd>dotnet run</kbd> command actually builds and runs the application. Now, go to the browser of your choice and navigate to <kbd>http://localhost:5000</kbd> to see the application running in your browser:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1035eb4c-283d-4272-9add-af8161a32f1d.png"/></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can go to the <span class="packt_screen">Explorer</span> view in the activity bar, open the <span><kbd>HelloDotNetCore2</kbd>&#160;folder, and press <em>F5</em>. This will also build the application and launch it in the browser.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Steps for creating the <span>application in Ubuntu through Visual Studio Code</span> are the same as in Windows, but instead of Command Prompt, we have Bash.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>F# is a functional programming language. Functional programming treats programs as mathematical expressions. It focuses on functions and constants that don't change, rather than variables and states. F# is a Microsoft programming language for concise and declarative syntax. Let's&#160;begin with a brief history of how this language came into existence. The first attempt at functional programming was&#160;<strong>Haskell .NET</strong>. F# development began in 2005 and after that, various versions came along.&#160;At the time of writing this chapter, F# 4.1 is the latest version; it was released in March 2017. This comes with Visual Studio 2017 and supports .NET Core.</p>
<p>The F# language can be used for the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>To solve mathematical problems</li>
<li>For graphic design</li>
<li>For financial modeling</li>
<li>For compiler programming</li>
<li>For CPU design</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also used for CRUD applications, web pages GUI games, and other programs.</p>

<p>In the F# language, we have two types of comments for a single line and for multiple lines. This is the same as C#. The following are the two types of comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single-line comment which starts with the&#160;<kbd>//</kbd> symbol.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Example:&#160;<kbd>// returns an integer exit code</kbd></p>
<ul>
<li>A multi-line comment which starts with (<kbd>*</kbd> and ends with <kbd>*</kbd>).</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p>F# has a rich data type system. We can broadly classify them as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integral types</strong>:&#160;<kbd>sbyte</kbd>, <kbd>byte</kbd>, <kbd>int16</kbd>, <kbd>uint16</kbd>, <kbd>int32</kbd>, <kbd>uint32</kbd>, <kbd>int64</kbd>, and&#160;<kbd>bigint</kbd></li>
<li><strong>Floating point types</strong>:&#160;<kbd>float32</kbd>, <kbd>float</kbd>, and&#160;<kbd>decimal</kbd></li>
<li><strong>Text types</strong>:&#160;<kbd>char</kbd>&#160;and&#160;<kbd>string&#160;</kbd></li>
<li><strong>Other types</strong>:&#160;<kbd>bool</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>These types are also referred to as fundamental primitive types&#160;in F#. Apart from these, F# has an exhaustive list of predefined types as well, such as lists, arrays, records, enumerations, tuples, &#160;units, sequences, and so on. It is recommended that a person learning F# goes through the official Microsoft documentation on F# at&#160;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/.</a></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Variable declaration</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>F# uses the <kbd>let</kbd> keyword for the declaration of a variable, for example:</p>
<pre>let square x = x*x</pre>
<p>The compiler automatically detects this as a value type. If we pass a float value, the compiler will be able to understand that without declaring a data type. Variables in F# are&#160;immutable, so once a value is assigned to a variable, it can't be changed. They are compiled as static read-only properties.</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates this:</p>
<pre>let x:int32 = 50<br/>let y:int32 = 30<br/>let z:int32 = x + y</pre>
<p>Variables <kbd>x</kbd>, <kbd>y</kbd>, and <kbd>z</kbd> are all of type&#160;<kbd>int32</kbd> and are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Let's print their values. The syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre>printfn "x: %i" x<br/>printfn "y: %i" y<br/>printfn "z: %i" z</pre>
<p><span>After the preceding code executes, the result is as follows:</span></p>
<pre>x: 50<br/>y: 30<br/>z: 80</pre>
<p>Now, suppose we want to modify the value of <kbd>x</kbd> from <kbd>50</kbd> to <kbd>60</kbd> and check that <kbd>z</kbd> reflects the updated sum; we will write the code as:</p>
<pre>let x = 60<br/>let y = 30<br/>let z = x + y</pre>
<p>On executing this code, we get the following errors, and rightly so because <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>z</kbd> are immutable:</p>
<pre>Duplicate definition of value 'x'<br/><span>Duplicate definition of value 'z'</span></pre>
<p>The correct way of doing it would be to use mutable variables for the declaration, as shown here:</p>
<pre>let mutable x = 60<br/>let y = 30 //It's optional to make y mutable.<br/>let mutable z = x + y<br/>x &lt;- 70<br/>z &lt;-  x + y</pre>
<p>On printing the values again, we will see:</p>
<pre>x: 70<br/>y: 30<br/>z: 100</pre>

<p>F# functions act like variables. We can declare and use them in the same way as we use variables in C#. A function definition starts with the <kbd>let</kbd><span>&#160;</span>keyword,&#160;<span>followed by the function name and parameters, a colon, its type, and the right-side expression, showing what the function does</span>. The syntax is follows:</p>
<pre>Let functionName parameters [ : returnType] = functionbody</pre>
<p>In the preceding syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>functionName</kbd>&#160;is an identifier of the function.</li>
<li><kbd>parameters</kbd>&#160;gives the list of parameters separated by spaces. We can also specify an explicit type for each parameter and if not specified, the compiler tends to presume it from the function body as variables.</li>
<li><kbd>functionbody</kbd>&#160;comprises an expression, or a compound expression, which has number of expressions. The final expression in the function body is the return value.</li>
<li><kbd>returnType</kbd>&#160;is a colon followed by a type and it is optional. If the <kbd>returnType</kbd> is not specified, then the compiler determines it from the final expression in the function body.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a look at the following example for our syntax:&#160;</p>
<pre>let addValue (x : int) = 5 + x</pre>

<p>A function can be called by passing the function name followed, by a space, and then arguments (if any) separated by spaces, as shown here:</p>
<pre>let sum = addValue 3</pre>
<p>We can perform many tasks using F# functions, some of which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can create a new function and link that function with a type as it acts as a variable type:<br/>
<kbd>let square x = x*x</kbd></li>
<li>We can perform some calculations as well, such as:<br/>
<kbd><kbd>let square x = x*x</kbd></kbd></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We can assign a value. Taking the same example:<br/>
<kbd>let square x = x*x</kbd></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We can pass a function as a parameter to another function like this:<br/>
<kbd>let squareValue = List.map square[1;2;3] // using square function</kbd></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We can return a function as a result of another function example:<br/>
<kbd>let squareValue = List.map square[1;2;3]</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>We are now going to see how to write and read in F#. To read and write into the console, we can use the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>To write:&#160;<kbd>System.Console.Write("Welcome!")</kbd></li>
<li>To read:&#160;<kbd><kbd>System.Console.Read()</kbd></kbd></li>
<li>To print:&#160;<kbd>printfn "Hello"</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's compare F# with C#:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <strong>F#</strong></p>

<p>The F# user is free from the obligation of defining types; for example: <kbd>let square x = x* x</kbd></p>
<p>The compiler can identify (<kbd>integer * integer</kbd>) or (<kbd>float * float</kbd>) when we pass a value.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The C# user is bound to provide a type:</p>
<p><kbd>Public int square(int x){ return x = x*x ; }</kbd></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>F# has immutable data, and the value never changes; for example: <kbd>let number = [3;2;1]</kbd></p>
<p><kbd>let moreNumber = 4:: number</kbd></p>
<p>In the preceding example, to add one more number, (<kbd>4</kbd>), we need to create a new list of items using <kbd>number</kbd>, and add the new record,&#160;<kbd>4</kbd> in this case. The same list doesn't get modified for safer asynchronous execution and a simplified understanding of a function.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C# has mutable as well as immutable data. Strings are immutable, the rest are all mutable, for example:</p>
<p><kbd>var number = new List&lt;int&gt; {1,2,3}; number.Add(4);</kbd></p>
<p>In the preceding example, we created a list and added a new item to the same list. The list gets modified.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><br/>
<br/>
F# compiles code in an order. It is favoured for data processing and algorithmic computation. It doesn't work on visibility; it works sequentially.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>F# has precise syntax; it focuses on <em>what not</em> and <em>how</em>; for example:</p>
<p><kbd>let square x = x*x</kbd></p>
<p><kbd>let squared = List.map square[1;2;3]&#160; // using square function</kbd></p>
<p>Right-click <span class="packt_screen">execute</span> | <span class="packt_screen">result</span> <kbd>1;4;9</kbd></p>
<p>F# uses declarative syntax, not imperative syntax as in C#. F# helps us to minimize accidental complexity, meaning complexity that is not a part of the problem, but which we introduced as part of the solution, for example:</p>
<p><kbd>let rec quicksort = function | [] -&gt; [] | x :: xs -&gt;&#160; let smaller = List.filter((&gt;)x) xs let larger = List.filter ((&lt;=)x) xs</kbd></p>
<p>Quicksort smaller <kbd>@ [x] @</kbd> quicksort larger:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><kbd>Let sorted = quicksort [4;5;4;7;9;1;6;1;0;-99;10000;3;2]</kbd></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><kbd>rec</kbd> is used for a recursive function. It is assigned in the sorted result. Run it and you will get a sorted result. It is a very simple sorting function with less complexity than C#, which has a high chance of errors.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>C# code implementation is more about how to implement. It sometimes increases unnecessary complexity as part of the solution to a problem.</p>
<p>Quick sort has a very complex algorithm and a high chance of increasing accidental complexity.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we discussed downloading Visual Studio Code, .NET Core 2.0, an Ubuntu 17.04 ISO image, and the tools required to start .NET Core application creation, as well as how to install them on Windows and Linux machines. We also discussed how to set up a Ubuntu Linux virtual machine and introduced the F# language.&#160;</p>
<p>In the following chapter, you'll be introduced to native libraries in .NET Core, used to extend console capabilities. We will discuss Interop with existing libraries and ncurses.&#160;</p>
