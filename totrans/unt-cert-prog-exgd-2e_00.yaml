- en: '*Unity Certified Programmer: Exam Guide â€“ Second Edition* will take a basic
    object-oriented programmer and introduce them to Unity through a creative project
    that stretches across the entire book, achieving essential exam core objectives
    that can be put toward Unity''s own Official Programmer Exam.'

- en: This book will take you (the programmer) through a discussion of the exam itself,
    breaking down each of its objectives, and what is expected of you to achieve a
    pass. From there, everything we'll discuss relates to supporting you with potential
    questions from the exam. So, we'll start straight away and refer to an overview
    of common design patterns and even more common SOLID principles that all programmers
    need to know. We will go through our game design brief and custom-built framework
    before we even touch Unity.

    a side-scrolling shooter game, and at the beginning of every chapter, it will
    be brought to your attention which core objectives we will be covering to support
    you. After some chapters, you will also be tested with a mini mock exam to see
    how you are getting on.

    standalone PC and/or Android device supporting a keyboard and touch screen controls,
    where you will fly a spaceship to fight off oncoming enemies.

    Manipulating Objects*, you will have coded the majority of the game, and the following
    chapters that we'll progress through will introduce you to Unity's tools and components,
    such as the Timeline, which is specifically built for the TV/film industry and
    cutscenes in games. You will cover particle effects, different materials to apply
    to your game objects to make them react to light, fading the sound in and out
    by manipulating an audio mixer with your scripting, pausing the game, storing
    values in your own scriptable objects, and much, much more.

- en: Some familiarity with Unity would be helpful but is not essential. A basic understanding
    of C# or any other object-oriented programming knowledge is required. At the time
    of writing this book, the Unity exam is based on Unity version 2020 LTS. We'll
    go through the procedure of downloading and installing the software in *Chapter
    1*, *Setting Up and Structuring Our Project*. If, for any reason, you are using
    a later version of Unity, that shouldn't matter unless the book mentions where
    things may differ between versions.
