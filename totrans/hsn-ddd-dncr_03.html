<p>Discovering domain terminology is essential, and this terminology becomes a part of the Ubiquitous Language. However, the process of discovery can be rather lengthy and not always successful. When we discuss how the business works and what problems we are going to solve by writing software, too often the conversation comes down to discussing the features that the business is keen to implement. A set of features, of course, can be called <strong>software</strong>, but it does not necessarily form a system. Furthermore, to build a comprehensive solution for a particular problem, more system-level thinking is required.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Thinking in systems is only briefly covered in this book. To know the subject better, please refer to great books on this topic like the classic <em>An Introduction to General System Thinking</em> by Gerald Weinberg and <em>Thinking in Systems</em> by Donella H. Meadows, et al.</div>
<p>But who is going to tell us how the business operates as a system? Whom shall we talk to, and what format should this conversation take? We will uncover issues like these and try to find some answers in this chapter.  </p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is EventStorming?</li>
<li>The practical aspects of EventStorming</li>
<li>How to facilitate a workshop yourself</li>
<li>Deciding what to do after the workshop ends</li>
</ul>

<p>In previous chapters, we learned how important it is to understand the actual problem. We also went deeper into the concept of Ubiquitous Language and explained that it is not only a glossary of terms but also the system's behavior described in words.</p>
<p>It remains unclear how to start the knowledge crunching and how to intensify our communication with domain experts to understand the problem space better and get a proper overview of what are we going to build.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Very often, we see that developers get to know the domain in the form of requirements. We have already been through this topic, and by now you should realize that requirements have their flaws. So, you want to improve your knowledge by talking directly to domain experts and organizing a workshop or meeting with them. Some people come, and you have a conversation for two or three hours; a lot of things get discussed, a lot of new insight comes to the surface, but there is a minimal outcome in the form of any modeling artifact. Sure, you could start drawing UML diagrams, but what business person would understand them? You could take notes to find out that you need a round or two of clarification workshops because there are too many vague and implicit concepts that form the foundation of your future system, and this makes it very hard to understand.</p>
<p class="mce-root">There are a few fundamental issues we need to be solved here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide visibility during the discussion. This should remove assumptions when many people are discussing the same thing with different terms. It also eliminates some of the ambiguity and brings it to the surface for further exploration.</li>
<li>Have a modeling language that people understand. UML is not an option, and the usual boxes and arrows have no real notation, so people can get confused and start spending time trying to clarify the meaning of things.</li>
<li>Involve many people simultaneously. In traditional meetings, only one person can effectively deliver the message, while everyone else needs to shut up and listen. As soon as many people start talking at the same time there is no conversation anymore. But, assuming people with different interests and backgrounds are present in one session, they might show a lack of interest and get bored.</li>
<li>Find a way to express terms, behavior, model processes, and decisions, not features and data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Back in 2013, Alberto Brandolini formulated a method that he called <strong>EventStorming</strong>, where he tried to address these issues. We are going to learn about this method in this chapter.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The basic idea behind EventStorming is that it gives a straightforward modeling notation that is used to visualize the behavior of the system in a way that everyone can understand. This approach creates visibility, increases engagement, and involves people who would otherwise be anxious about any participation in a modeling session at all, or putting anything on a whiteboard if they attend.</p>
<p>Considering behavior as the central aspect of the domain knowledge, the whole EventStorming exercise is about finding out how the business works. In general, we could postulate that each system at any given moment of time is found in a particular state. This state can change when actors that interact with the system do something. Actions of those actors cause the system to change state, so we can see that something has happened and now we need to deal with a new situation.</p>
<p>Let's look at a simple example of someone paying their bill using internet banking:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/116ad4eb-fcd9-4f5c-9e42-6d1241407fda.png" style="width:47.58em;height:6.67em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">The sequence of events for payment processing (simplified)</div>
<p>As you can see here, from the person's point of view, the amount of money in their account decreased, the payment is complete, and the bill is considered paid and can be thrown away. From the recipient's point of view, however, the bill is considered paid when they get the money and can match this payment with an open bill by using an invoice number or some magic payment reference that was mentioned on the bill and the payment.</p>
<p>Each action performed by actors in these systems made some state transitions. The payment order was created and signed. The amount was deducted from the payer's account. The amount was then added to the payee's account. The bill was marked as paid. All these operations became <em>facts of life</em>, and, unless we have a time machine, we cannot reverse them. If the payee discovers that the bill has already been paid, they cannot just reverse everything. They need to send the money back by initiating a new payment.</p>
<p>These facts are known as <strong>domain events</strong>. It is the most basic and also the most important concept that EventStorming deals with. It is why it is called EventStorming. The idea of domain events is not alien to anyone. Facts of life are something that people can quickly grasp. They are something that happened; not something that someone wanted to do; not a feature; not a form or a button. Each domain event represents a fact, a change in the system we are trying to model.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first part of our modeling language is to create the concept of domain events. Each concept in EventStorming is represented as a sticky note of a specific color. The color is essential because, as we go along and bring more thoughts to the model, we need colors to consistently represent the same ideas across the model to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>The original suggestion of Alberto is to use orange sticky notes to represent domain events. The simplest possible model could look like this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/089323e7-7db2-4d30-9a0c-238661c516c1.png" style="width:18.33em;height:10.17em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Start small and go from there</div>
<p>These are two domain events that occurred in sequence—first, a customer paid using a credit or debit card; then their order was confirmed. We can identify this as an e-commerce domain. There is nothing special about sentences written on sticky notes, except one crucial rule—events must have a subject (noun) and a predicate (verb). The verb must be in the past tense, indicating that something has happened and it became a fact.</p>
<p>If we get back to the bill payment example, we could try figuring out what events we would find there:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/cc0915e2-c754-4088-bdfa-365ad09fe429.png" style="width:78.00em;height:21.33em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Events are placed on the timeline</div>
<p>There are a couple of things that you might immediately notice. The first is that domain events follow a timeline. It is quite logical because facts represent subsequent changes in the system and therefore happen in a particular order. For example, the payment is not approved before it is signed. Some things can happen in parallel, such as debiting and crediting accounts at the same time, as soon as the payment order is approved, which might mean that the bank is confident that the payer has enough funds to complete the payment.</p>
<p>The second thing is that we do not have only one system here. Indeed, we are modeling the whole process, but there are at least three parts that we can clearly distinguish—the user-facing internet bank, which creates and signs payment orders; the banking back office, which completes the transaction; and the payee's own payment-to-bill matching system that, by the way, could be completely manual.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As we can see, our simple model already provides quite a lot of value to people involved in the workshop. Not only did we try to identify what happens during the process of a bill being paid, but we put the whole flow on a timeline and were able to roughly identify parts of the process that can happen in different physical systems.</p>
<p>Visualization is one of the most powerful aspects of any modeling technique, and EventStorming is not an exception. As soon as we put something on our model, we can reason about it instead of just pronouncing words and waving hands.</p>
<p>When people see what is considered to be the whole picture, some might start asking <em>what if </em>questions<em>.</em> <em>What if</em> there is not enough money in the account? <em>What if</em> the bill reference number is wrong? <em>What if</em> the payee account is not correct? What if, what if, what if? It then appears that our simple process is not that simple at the end of the day. Remember the availability heuristic, <strong>WYSIATI</strong> (short for <strong>What You See Is All There Is</strong>)? We base our initial understanding on a simplified view of the world. Everything works as it should; there are no exceptions and no edge cases, people behave and don't plan to make mistakes, with or without intentions to do so. It might come as a surprise, but the real world is a bit more complicated. Most of the time the number of edge cases; exceeds what is considered to be a regular flow of events. All these edge cases and potential exceptions become much more visible when things are visualized and brought to light for everyone to observe.</p>
<p>There is one issue here, which can do a disservice to those who are trying their best to create a proper events model. You could imagine that such a workshop happens in a meeting room. Usually, people sit around a table and talk. As we have already suggested, this is not how EventStorming works. We expect people to move around the room and be actively engaged in conversations, which might happen simultaneously at different sides of the room. So, we need some space. But this is not all the space we need. Have a good look at the preceding simple process model. Although we all could agree that we just modeled the happy path and no edge cases and exceptions are covered, the real-life process is way more complicated; this diagram already takes some horizontal space. Now, imagine real-world scenarios being modeled like this. Indeed, a traditional two-three meter whiteboard would do a disservice for you.</p>
<p>Imagine your model like this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2b48a021-c527-4039-9c06-f556fa3c7d99.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">For a reasonably complex system you need a bigger space</div>
<p class="mce-root">Here in the middle is your whiteboard. But the model is not that small. As Alberto says, <em>my problem is bigger!</em> </p>
<p>What happens when there is not enough space left on a whiteboard? People treat the space left as a sacred resource. It becomes precious, and people start saving space. Some events become <strong>not important</strong> and therefore not put on the whiteboard. Some ideas become secondary and not worth looking at. All in all, the modeling discussion suffers to save some whiteboard space.</p>
<p>It is normal, and this is how our brain works. If we see some limit, no matter how silly or artificial it will look in retrospect, we will feel its physical presence and will also set up our activities accordingly. If you have a limited modeling space, prepare to get a limited model. So, beware of this issue and provide as much modeling space as you can for participants of any modeling session and of EventStorming meetings in particular. We will get some more specific advice in the next section.</p>

<p>This section provides practical advice and shares some real-life experience for you as a facilitator of an EventStorming workshop. Remember that you do not need to <strong>sell</strong> DDD in your organization before doing EventStorming. This rather simple but very effective technique can help <span>even </span>if you have no plans to do DDD in your project. It will help you to build an understanding of the domain, for which you plan to create some software. It also creates a better relationship between developers and their potential users, since they will be openly discussing the problems that users have and showing empathy to these problems, while simultaneously seeking solutions.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>For the workshop, you will always need to have two types of people—people with questions and people with answers.</p>
<p>People with questions are developers and architects. Surprisingly, developers rarely attend any sessions that directly involve the potential users of the software they plan to develop. We touched upon this topic when we discussed the separation between problem space and solution space in <a href="948b7834-c47c-4321-a91c-2ba58068c52e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Why Domain-Driven Design?</em>. So again, having developers at these workshops is essential. Another group of people that some might expect to be those with answers, but who, in reality, have more questions are business analysts or requirements analysts, or whatever are they are called in your organization. Admittedly, they spend quite a lot of time together with potential users and customers, but usually, during the EventStorming workshop, they get new insights since this exercise is not one-to-one but for a group.</p>
<p>This group needs to study the information about the domain that is already available (general understanding, perhaps requirements or specifications if they have already been made) and prepare questions.</p>
<p>People with answers are usually those who we call <strong>domain experts</strong>.<em><strong> </strong></em>But remember that they do not know all the details, and they also can have an illusion of knowledge. This is why you need as many of them as you can get in the workshop since these people are usually not easy to gather together in one room because of their busy schedule. This indirectly suggests that these people are generally quite high in the organizational hierarchy, but not necessarily. You need to aim at getting the most people from each department. You should search for those who know how things are done instead of those who only know how things should be done, based on some fictitious descriptions and standards.</p>
<p>Both <em>people with questions</em> and <em>people with answers</em> groups would need to prepare for the workshop by formulating their questions better. Thinking about what issues need to be solved and being more specific about these issues, might help during the workshop. The preparation part doesn't only apply for developers. In the end, it is the business who needs their problems to be solved, so it would be helpful for them to be aware of their own needs and to have enough materials to be able to communicate these needs to the group of techies that supposedly will address those needs by writing code.</p>

<p>Very often you can observe people coming to a workshop held in a regular meeting room to find out that there is no whiteboard, the projector does not work, and the presenter has a video output socket that is incompatible with the video equipment in the room. Such things are all very frustrating because they take a lot of time to fix, leaving less time for the actual work. What's even worse, it's not just one person whose time is wasted on this kind of issue. Everyone in this room is effectively blocked from doing anything and has to wait. Sometimes it is best to cancel the meeting in order not to lose any more time.</p>
<p>This is the situation you want to avoid, and EventStorming workshops have some specific requirements that need to be addressed in advance, to avoid such confusion.</p>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Materials</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Well in advance, when you have agreed on a date and time when people with questions will finally meet people with answers, start preparing documents immediately.</p>
<p>The most important material is your future modeling space. Remember, your problem is way bigger than any whiteboard you can find in any meeting room (except maybe the one you designed to hold EventStorming sessions, but I doubt you have one). It means you will have to use walls as the modeling space. Sticky notes do not stay well on walls, except walls made of glass. You will also want to remove your model from the wall afterward in order not to frustrate people who use the room after you.</p>
<p>Therefore, you will need a paper roll. For guerilla-style EventStorming, you might use a simple paper roll from IKEA, the original purpose of which is to provide unlimited painting space for children. But it is too narrow, and the best option is to acquire a plotter paper roll. These rolls are wider (usually about one meter wide), longer, and made from higher quality paper.</p>
<p>The next thing is to have something that you can use to fix the paper to the wall. You might need to inspect the wall's surface in the room where you plan to hold the workshop and try different fixing methods. Ensure that you have little or no obstacles for the paper roll, so the wall should not have paintings, holes, doors, or windows.</p>
<p>Of course, you need a lot of sticky notes. And I mean a lot. You never know how many domain events people are going to write, and the last thing you want to experience is when people start reconsidering events because there are no more sticky notes left. Stickies are cheap, and ideas are expensive, so take care to bring enough stickies to capture all ideas. You will need different sizes and colors; we will go through the color notation later in this chapter:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c7a2d2ac-3ca8-498b-822f-9be2e7169f19.png" style="width:27.33em;height:20.50em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">This is the least you will need</div>
<p>The final part is stationary. It is too often forgotten as something that's obvious, and then you are left with a handful of highly paid, very busy people in the room and only one working pen. It can be very frustrating. So, buy enough permanent markers, preferably black, not very thin and not very thick. Ideally, you need one marker pen per person and some to spare.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Now, the place. EventStorming cannot be done when people are sitting. Quite the opposite—they need to stand and walk freely around the whole space. This is why the traditional meeting room set up with a large table in the center and lots of chairs around it does not work. So, the first thing you will need to ensure is that the walls where you plan to put the paper roll have enough space between them for people to move freely. Ideally, all chairs need to be removed, or at least moved to one place, far from the modeling space.</p>
<p>There should be some place where all the stationery will be placed. Therefore you will need at least a small table somewhere in the corner. Also, it is helpful to have the notation visible, so people use specific colors for specific concepts. Using different colors for one concept is very confusing and should be avoided.</p>
<p>EventStorming sessions are usually very intense and involve a lot of movement, thinking, and talking, and sometimes arguing. It is often fun but can be exhausting. So, as a facilitator, you need to keep the sugar level high and throats soothed. Prepare some snacks, drinks, and fruit—this helps. People also respect this kind of treatment and get a feeling of being invited to a special event.</p>

<p>So, now space is prepared, and you need to call people into the room. When you get them coming to your session, use the tips in this section to keep an eye on the time and make the session more productive. We will also be going through some tips on how to observe and interpret human behavior, and how to make the meeting constructive.</p>

<p>Plan at least two hours for one session. It might <span>not </span>feel enough (and this is usually true), but it is tough for people to be productive for a more extended period in such an environment. A more extended workshop will exhaust discussions and create a feeling of going in circles. That might be the case just because almost everything that can be discussed has already been considered and put on the wall. Therefore, resist the urge to plan more extended workshops, such as whole-day sessions.</p>
<p>The first hour is usually very intense, but after that, you will see the energy levels dropping. Let people rest for ten minutes, have a coffee, and eat the fruit you got for them. Often, participants will keep chatting in small groups about what has been discussed, so their brains will still be processing the information, but in a more relaxed way. After a break, new insights are usually uncovered. Also, you will need to apply different techniques step by step, and a break after the first hour will give you an excellent opportunity to do something different from what you were doing during the first part of the workshop. We will discuss these techniques later in this chapter.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The beginning of an EventStorming session with people who have never done it before can be quite awkward. You, as a facilitator, explain the rules and give people pens and stickies, then put up the first element of the notation:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fa1e7fd2-9e87-4e8c-a7c8-eedb4f277b08.png" style="width:18.58em;height:11.58em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">The first element in the notation</div>
<p>After this is done, there will be this moment of silence and uncertain movements in the crowd. No one knows what to do, and people are usually uncomfortable with doing something they aren't familiar with. It becomes especially obvious if such activity needs to be performed in front of the crowd:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5fa7cca3-df6f-4aba-a1eb-c5ce8decaeee.png" style="width:16.25em;height:19.00em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">The random event in the middle—the icebreaker</div>
<p>This moment requires the facilitator to break the ice. It is not hard to do. When you organize such a session, you already know something about the organization and the domain. That allows you to imagine a domain event, or two, or more. Putting this on the wall is exactly what people need to learn by example. The whole thing is not hard to do, but without an example, people don't feel safe and secure. So, as a facilitator, you will need to put the first sticky note on the wall, or a few of them. Try making it relevant, or you can intentionally make them very silly, expecting people to react with laughter and sarcasm, fixing your error. Of course, the first reaction that you get is people speaking out loud what they think needs to be put on the wall, without taking any action at all and expecting you to write things down. This is how <em>traditional</em> meetings are done—people talk, and someone hopefully is taking notes. Resist this. As soon as you see someone explaining what you need to write on the next sticky or telling you that the stuff on the wall is wrong, just give them a pen and a stack of sticky notes. They will start writing. They will produce. They will discuss. Then, your job will be to observe and to guide, in case people get stuck.</p>
<p>There are at least two techniques that I know of about how to start the workshop by putting the first sticky note on the wall. The first comes from Alberto Brandolini. He says that you can put anything you want anywhere you want, but not at the start. Starting at the <em>beginning</em> is something you want to avoid. It is very natural for us as human beings to seek structure, and in our view, each process starts and ends somewhere. So, logically speaking, we need to start at the beginning. The only issue here is that there is no beginning. First, we always spend a lot of time and energy discussing where the process starts, without producing anything. Second, there will be something before any identified start, guaranteed. Therefore, put the first sticky somewhere in the middle and work from there. Stuff that happens before that event will go to the left, and things that occur after, to the right:</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Now fill all the space in between</div>
<p>Dan North mentioned another technique in his talk at DDD Exchange 2016. On one sticky he writes <strong>Once upon a time</strong> and puts it close to the left side of the paper roll, but not at the edge. On the second sticky, he writes <strong>Happily ever after</strong> and puts it close to the right side of the paper roll, but again, not at the edge. You need these gaps on both sides because, as mentioned earlier, there will be definitely something earlier than <strong>Once upon a time</strong> and later than <strong>Happily ever after</strong>, and you will need space to put it there. As you can see, you need to have exactly zero knowledge about the domain to produce these two stickies, and it works quite efficiently. People get a sense of time, and with something already on the wall with space in between for them to fill, it sparks their imagination.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>As a facilitator, your role is not to rule, but to observe and guide. The fewer rules you will set and enforce, the better your workshop is going to be. After the ice-breaking, some people will start putting stuff on the wall, and other people will start asking questions. At this stage, there are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>People tend to ask the facilitator <span>questions, </span>as they see them as the meeting organizer and therefore as a person who has more information and authority. As a facilitator, direct them and their questions to other people in the room, in particular to those people with answers, whom you have invited.</li>
<li>There will be some confusion about domain events, especially if your audience are not native English speakers and the term <strong>domain event</strong> can be seen as technical (it isn't). As a result, there might be some who keep putting up stickies with features they desire to have (such as payment processing or a shopping cart), or imperative actions (such as process payment or register customer). It is the facilitator's job to prevent this and explain once again that, at this stage, the goal is to describe the flow of domain events, which are the facts of life and cannot be undone, removed, or changed.</li>
<li>Apart from what has been mentioned earlier, there are no real mistakes or errors that people can make, at least at the level of notation. Do not try to de-duplicate events or generalize, do not discourage people from doing stuff by saying they are doing something incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, these three tips help to drive the workshop from the organizational point of view. But since we are dealing with people, there are always some behavioral and personal aspects. Several things usually happen that are essential for the facilitator to observe and sometimes intervene.</p>
<p>First, be prepared for complex discussions. If there are no discussions, then either the domain is too simple, or you got the wrong people, or there is something else that prevents people from speaking up. Disputes are inevitable since every person in the room has their point of view on the domain. Even developers quickly form their opinions after they understand the initial idea, or maybe read the specification. The critical thing here is that developers need to ask questions. There should be no assumptions about what happens and how it happens. It is the facilitator's job to encourage developers to participate since some of them are introverts and don't really like being in an open discussion. But since our goal is to give developers a better understanding of the domain, they need to participate.</p>
<p>Try to pay attention to edge cases. People always prefer to model the happy path, when no exceptions and errors occur. We always need to keep in mind that one event is a consequence of some other event under certain conditions. Yes, there could be some straight flows, but they aren't commonplace, especially if we are talking about business. For example, <em>payment processed</em> can logically lead to <em>order paid</em>, then <em>order shipped</em>, and then <em>order delivered</em>. But what if the payment has failed? What if the payment amount does not cover the full order total (partial payment)? What if goods aren't available in stock, although we think that they are? What if the parcel is lost in transit? All these things can and will happen. For developers, they might seem complicated, and usually, they don't know how to deal with these situations other than throwing an exception. But the business often has procedures in place to fix most of these situations, and these fixes can and should be modeled.</p>
<p>Second, discussions about edge cases <span>will </span>almost certainly create some ambiguity and uncertainty because not all exceptions are covered by business processes, or the people that you have available for the workshop don't deal with such situations. If there are several domain experts in the room, they might disagree and argue with each other. For your short workshop, such circumstances are counterproductive. Therefore, if you observe that some heated discussion is taking place, or at some point, there are too many puzzled faces and no one can bring clarity to something, you can identify a hotspot. At this point, you need to introduce one more element to the notation. Hotspots are usually marked by bright sticky notes; for example, Alberto proposes bright pink. So, you might have something like this on the wall:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/90b8a5c4-b889-40d9-b80a-974d26dc815b.png" style="width:25.17em;height:13.33em;"/></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Bright colors help to bring attention</div>
<p>Identifying and characterizing hotspots allows you to postpone decisions and cut off arguments, effectively letting the group to move forward and not get stuck. You might find your wall full of hotspots by the end of the workshop, and this is entirely normal. It indicates that people that you have invited either need to come to some agreement about handling some situations, or you need to speak to someone else and collect missing information. Hotspots deserve close attention, but it should be after the workshop has finished. Try to cut off unproductive discussions and going in circles by putting up a pink sticky and asking people to move on.</p>
<p>The third thing to keep in mind is that, when you have a few domain experts who specialize in different parts of a larger domain, you will observe them grouping together by functional specialization area, forming islands or clouds of events that barely connect to other islands produced by other groups. It is very interesting to observe and essential to catch since you might be witnessing the first draft of your context map. We will discuss context maps later in the book. Do not discourage people from doing this, and go with the flow. Pay attention to how these islands interconnect. Usually, a minimal number of events belong to more than one group of domain events.</p>
<p>Then finally, there is a chance that your business works with organizations and systems that are out of your control. Such entities can be called <strong>external systems</strong> and need to be put on the model. There are domain events that can go to such systems, and you might <span>also </span>receive some events from external systems. That introduces the new element in your notation, and in Alberto's color scheme external systems are visualized using large pastel pink sticky notes:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/584e5b87-0aeb-45b9-9bab-8864c470e7f7.png" style="width:36.33em;height:19.50em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Payment provider is an external system</div>
<p>Remember about the unlimited modeling space and ensure that people do not try to save space because there is not much space left. Reorganize events to make more space or, preferably, put more paper on the wall. Remember that paper is cheap and knowledge is precious. You don't want to lose understanding because someone is saving space on paper.</p>
<p>When people run out of ideas, and there will be some awkward moments of silence. You might need to ignite the fire again by offering to look at the model from a different perspective. There are at least two relatively easy ways to enrich the model by adding something that's missing. First, ask people to traverse the timeline backward. Very often, something that was considered not significant was not put on the wall, but this thing is essential for the next thing to happen. For example, someone might have forgotten that a packing list needs to be produced before the order is shipped. <span>Another technique is to identify where the business creates value. Trivially, try following the money. Very often, developers get into discussing fancy nice-to-haves and forget that the business needs to earn something to pay their salary.</span></p>
<p>Finally, as mentioned before, keep the time in mind and have at least one break per hour. Keep your promise and don't go overboard; don't keep people for longer than they have planned to stay. If you followed my advice and bought some fruit and drinks, some might even want to continue, but it is up to them to decide whether your workshop should take longer than expected.</p>

<p>When time is up, most probably you'll have a long paper roll with a lot of sticky notes in different colors. A lot of time and effort has been spent producing it, and this paper roll is often seen as a precious artifact. However, this is not exactly the case. You might want to keep evidence of what you have discussed and modeled, and especially the list of hotspots. But the main takeaway is the knowledge that developers and other participants just gained and will take to the bank. More domain knowledge and less ignorance are the most important, albeit invisible, artifacts of the EventStorming session.</p>
<p>That does not mean that you will throw away the paper roll. People that do it for the first time might see such action as a sign of disrespect. Keep the roll, take panoramic, pictures and send it to everyone. Yes, most probably you will never open the roll again. It is much more productive to create all these events from scratch should you need to do it again. People already know, and it will be even more beneficial for them to refine the model this way. But, for the sake of safety, keep the roll somewhere safe for a couple of weeks:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a02271a4-04d4-4c3e-b42d-1bdc611cb079.png" style="width:37.00em;height:27.42em;"/></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Keep them, but you'll probably never look at them again</div>
<p>Remember to plan follow-up sessions to discuss hotspots. Usually, smaller groups might need to participate. Sometimes you will need to invite someone else because of the questions you have got. You might not need to repeat what has already been done and concentrate on discussing the issues you have discovered. Indeed, using EventStorming in such discussions is beneficial and will enrich the model.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will also discuss how to perform the design-level EventStorming, which is a bit more technical and can only be done on a smaller functional area of the domain. The outcome of such a session can be taken straight to your issue tracker.</p>

<p>Now let's try to practice and do an imaginary EventStorming session for our sample application domain. It is not easy to imagine how it would go since the most crucial aspect of any EventStorming workshop is the people and how they behave. We definitely cannot reproduce it here in writing, but we can imagine some discussions that can take place and the event flow that is produced.</p>
<p>We will be going through a fictitious EventStorming session, where a classified ads application will be discussed. A facilitator, let's call her Ann, has invited the following people to the workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>John, the company owner. He believes that the system will be the market leader due to its simplicity and unique features.</li>
<li>Mary is the UX (user experience) designer, and she has done some research on existing systems and has talked to some potential users.</li>
<li>Nick and Eve are full-stack developers.</li>
<li>Ian executes the back office, dealing with finances and ensuring that the company is doing well.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is time for the planned session, and people stream into the meeting room, trying to locate chairs, but there are none. There are two small tables in the room—on one they find some fruit and drinks; on the other one lies a bunch of sticky notes of different colors and a lot of marker pens, enough for a crowd double the size. Two walls are decorated with a long sheet of paper, about seven meters in length. There is also a flipchart and a whiteboard. People look a bit puzzled, and now it is time to provide some clarity:</p>
<p><em>"Welcome to our first, but hopefully not last, EventStorming workshop</em>,<em>"</em> says Ann. <em>"</em>W<em>e will be exploring how our company would like the business to run, and by the end of this session, everyone in this room should have a shared understanding of what we want to do</em>.</p>
<p><em>"To do this, we will describe what happens on our side when customers use our services,"</em> continues Ann, <em>"And we will be using sticky notes for that. To start with, we will just put up statements of fact, also known as domain events, on the wall. Imagine how stuff flows through the business, and when something happens, write a couple of words in the past tense on a sticky note and put it on the wall."</em></p>
<p>Ann writes the word <em>legend</em> on the flip chart and puts up an orange sticky note with the words <em>something happened—domain event</em> in the middle. Then she draws a horizontal arrow on top of the paper sheet on the wall and writes <em>time</em> underneath. <em>"</em><em>Since one fact follows another fact, they form sequences, or processes, which don't happen simultaneously, but in order, one after another. Therefore, we try to arrange these events on a timeline,"</em> she explains.</p>
<p>People in the room seem to get it, and Ann gives everyone a pile of sticky notes and a pen. Still, everyone seems reluctant to do anything and instead look at each other and feel a bit uncomfortable and nervous like they are afraid of doing something wrong. Then John says, <em>"Well, the best place to start is the start. What would be the first thing that happened? Maybe when a customer registers with us</em><em>."</em> Such uncertainty triggers a discussion that goes nowhere. There is still not a single sticky note placed on the wall. Noticing this, Ann writes <strong>Classified Ad Published</strong> on a sticky and puts it somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>A single sticky note on the wall sparks a discussion on what the primary element in the system should be called—would this be a <em>classified ad</em>, or just an <em>ad</em>, or something else? People start putting things that seem to happen before an <em>ad</em> is published, such as <strong>Ad created</strong> and <strong>Ad updated</strong>. After a glimpse, Mary expresses skepticism about these terms, since ads aren't updated. There are multiple independent properties of the ad, which change differently. For example, uploading a picture is done separately, then <span>the ad title is </span>updated. Changing the ad category can be restricted, and updating the price could trigger some interesting behaviors, such as informing people who have subscribed to a feed of classified ads for which the price recently decreased.</p>
<p>At the same time, John starts to discuss some advanced features, such as seller and buyer ratings, and eventually, they find out that, on the other part of the wall, there are no buyers or sellers, but <em>users</em>. This term seems to have meaning when talking about authentication and profiles but does not help during the selling and buying process.</p>
<p>At this moment, the wall looks like this:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3d6854f6-0e1f-4eac-96dc-277ca5582f52.png" style="width:56.67em;height:19.75em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">First model</div>
<p>Some work is done, and people need a little break to consume all the goodies that Ann has prepared for them, and to reflect on what has been discussed and discovered.</p>
<p>After the break, they continue.</p>
<p>Eve and John start to discuss the approval process, which was completely missing before. It seems that there is a large percentage of potentially fraudulent and generally malicious classified ads that are placed on competitor's sites, and all of them have some prevention mechanisms. Those who don't bother doing any reviewing at all quickly lose their credibility and trust, and are pushed out of business. But our company has no personnel to keep up with reviewing all ads manually, so the discussion keeps going in circles. Ann notices this and puts a bright pink sticky note on the wall that says <em>malicious ads detection</em>. <em>"We seem to need this, but we aren't sure how,"</em> she says. <em>"Let's just put it here as a reminder and get back to it later when we have discussed the rest."</em> The discussion on this topic then stops and constructively continues towards evolving the process before and after the detection takes place.</p>
<p>At this point, the third element is added to the notation:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/553ec1b6-516f-449a-b42e-57388e334de8.png" style="width:14.58em;height:19.50em;"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Final notation for the Big Picture workshop</div>
<p>Ian wasn't very active in the discussion and was walking around nodding and sometimes making a grimace of dissent. When Ann asked him what is wrong, Ian impatiently replies, <em>"N</em><em>o one has even thought about how are we going to earn any money. Without earning anything we will not survive. We don't have that much investment, and we better get some revenue as soon as we can</em>.<em>"</em> That sends a small shockwave through the team, and people start thinking about how they forgot to bring the money aspect to the picture. Then, John explains the original idea that the essential service is free, but some additional services, such as placing an ad at the top of the search results, showing larger pictures, and so on, will be offered for a small fee. He also explains that the free service is only available for private individuals, and if a company wants to sell something via the website, they need to have an exclusive agreement. Plus, he continues, selling cars and real estate should be an entirely different thing, since it requires advanced integration and some safety measures, and these services will never be free.</p>
<p>This new information sparks discussions, and after a short while everyone agrees that for the first version they need to target the largest audience and the most straightforward possible service. It means that they will only offer free ads with a couple of options, which should create the primary revenue stream.</p>
<p>We're now at the end of the workshop, and the wall is covered in sticky notes. Here is what they produced:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/43147c0d-ea06-41a3-9a13-68a35c848f87.png"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Final big picture model</div>
<p>As we can see, the session uncovered several points that were either unknown or assumed by others but were never made clear. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no such thing as <em>ad updated</em>, but rather a <em>picture uploaded</em> and <em>price decreased</em> and so on, which are more precise and trigger different logic.</li>
<li>There are different contexts where a person is known as a <em>user</em> and at the same time as a <em>seller</em> or <em>buyer</em>. The link between those contexts isn't stable, which might be an indication that these are at least different entities.</li>
<li>The <strong>minimal viable product </strong>(<strong>MVP</strong>) shrank to the bare minimum of free ads with small paid additions. Everything else will come later on.</li>
<li>Features such as seller and buyer ratings and smart suggestions are nice to have but do not bring immediate value to the users.</li>
<li>There will be, however, a strong need for some malicious content detection system, since manual reviewing will work for an insufficient period, if we consider the expectations of the number of ads to be published per day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Developers got a much better understanding of what the business expects the system to do, and how their UX expert wants it to look. They made many adjustments and original ideas, and everyone seems to be on the same page. The ignorance level is much lower than before, and the risk of developers being busy solving the wrong problem is significantly mitigated.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we have learned what EventStorming is, and why every team would benefit from organizing such a workshop with domain experts, that is, to gain domain knowledge and decrease ignorance. We also looked at some practical tips on how an EventStorming session can be arranged and facilitated.</p>
<p>The final part of this chapter is about the model for our sample business. We discussed the business flow, identified many events and some hotspots, gaining a significant amount of insight into what kind of system we are going to build during this book.</p>
<p>We have briefly touched on the behavioral aspect of EventStorming, but there is more to it, which we cannot cover in this book due to the broad nature of this topic. Check out the next section to find references to Alberto Brandolini's work, and study the referenced materials to learn more about people, their biases and behaviors, and why software development is a learning process.</p>
<p><span>In the next chapter, we will look deeper into the modeling process, with more of a focus on artifacts that can help us to start writing code and deliver initial prototypes as soon as possible.</span></p>
<div class="packt_tip">The EventStorming community has a lot of discussions about using the technique in distributed teams or when end users aren't directly available to participate in such sessions. Alberto points out that the body language is extremely important to get an overall feeling of how the session goes and to identify the roles of the participants in the session and in the business. In my view, that is true, but we often deal with situations when such a session is nearly impossible to organize. For distributed systems, I would personally recommend using online real-time tools, like Miro, which I used to create many diagrams for this book. It allows for people to participate in modeling sessions wherever they are located.<br/>
<br/>
For SaaS businesses, the issue might be even harder because there's no single group of users that can be trusted to represent the whole user base. However, even with such a scenario, it is often possible to identify a group of the most engaged customers and invite them to be a part of your team. Not only you get great insights about how they use your system and how they want it to be improved, but also you get great free publicity by the word of mouth. People overall respect openness and greatly appreciate when their voice is heard by developers.</div>
