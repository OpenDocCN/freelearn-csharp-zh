                    <h1 class="header-title">Using Tools to Write Better Code</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As we saw in <a href="82dfe57b-5fe6-4c71-9fa9-b4526a2c6f3e.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Best Practices in Coding C# 8</em>, coding can be considered an art, but writing understandable code is surely more like philosophy. In the aforementioned chapter, we discussed practices that you, as a software architect, need for your developers. In this chapter, we will describe the techniques and tools for code analysis, so you have well-written code for your project.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying well-written code </li>
<li>Understanding the tools that can be used in the process to make things easier</li>
<li>A book use case—implementing code inspection before publishing the application</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the chapter, you will be able to define which tools you are going to incorporate into your software development life cycle to enable code analysis.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Technical requirements</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This chapter requires Visual Studio 2017 or the 2019 free Community Edition or better. You will find the sample code for this chapter at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Software-Architecture-with-CSharp-8/tree/master/ch16">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Software-Architecture-with-CSharp-8/tree/master/ch16</a>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Identifying a well-written code</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>It is not easy to define whether a code is well-written or not. The best practices described in <a href="82dfe57b-5fe6-4c71-9fa9-b4526a2c6f3e.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Best Practices in Coding C# 8</em>, can certainly guide you as a software architect to define a standard for your team. But even with a standard, mistakes will happen and you will probably find them only after the code is in production. The decision to refactor code in production just because it does not follow all the standards you define is not an easy one to take, especially if this code is working properly. Some people conclude that a well-written code is one that works well in production. However, this surely can cause damage to the software's life, since developers can be inspired by that not-standard code. </p>
<p class="mce-root">For this reason, you—as a software architect—need to find ways to anticipate the lack of application of the coding standard you defined. Luckily, nowadays, we have many options for tools that can help us with this task. They are considered the automation of static code analysis; this technique is seen as a great opportunity to improve the software developed and to help the developers.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The reason your developers will evolve with code analysis is that you start to disseminate knowledge between them during code inspections. The tools that we have now have the same purpose. Better than that, with Roslyn they do this task while you are writing the code. Roslyn is the compiler platform for .NET, and it enables you to develop some tools for analyzing code. These analyzers can check style, quality, design, and other issues.</p>
<p>For instance, look at the following code. It does not make any sense, but you can see that there are some mistakes:</p>
<pre>using System;<br/>namespace SampleCodeChapter16<br/>{<br/>    class Program<br/>    {<br/>        static void Main(string[] args)<br/>        {<br/>            try<br/>            {<br/>                int variableUnused = 10;<br/>                int variable = 10;<br/>                if (variable == 10)<br/>                {<br/>                    Console.WriteLine("variable equals 10");<br/>                }<br/>                else<br/>                {<br/>                    switch (variable)<br/>                    {<br/>                        case 0:<br/>                            Console.WriteLine("variable equals 0");<br/>                            break;<br/>                    }<br/>                }<br/>            }<br/>            catch<br/>            {<br/>            }<br/>        }<br/>    }<br/>}</pre>
<p>The idea of this code is to show you the power of some tools to improve the code you are delivering. Let's check each of them in the next topic, including how to set up them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Understanding and applying tools that can evaluate C# code</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The evolution of code analysis in Visual Studio is continuous. This means that Visual Studio 2019 certainly has more tools for this purpose than Visual Studio 2017, and so on. </p>
<p>One of the issues that you (as a software architect) need to deal with is the <em>coding style of the team</em>. This certainly results in a better understanding of the code. For instance, if you go to <em>Visual Studio Menu | Tools | Options</em>, you will find ways to set up how to deal with different code style patterns, and it even indicates a bad coding style as an error in the Code Style option, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/48eb0404-e3c0-4b69-9b57-66271bda3e5b.png"/></p>
<p>For instance, the preceding screenshot suggests that Avoid unused parameters were considered an error. After this change, the result of the compilation of the same code presented at the beginning of the chapter was different, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/3ea8d20a-4244-4630-bd72-3b963c7a8866.png" style="width:31.08em;height:14.00em;"/></p>
<p>You can export your coding style configuration and attach it to your project so it will follow the rules you have defined.</p>
<p>Another good tool that Visual Studio 2019 provides is <strong>Analyze and Code Cleanup</strong>. In this tool, you are able to set up some code standards that can be cleaned from your code using the tool. For instance, in the following screenshot, it was set to remove unnecessary code:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/12335399-998f-491a-8ad6-1a19fb2a9753.png" style="width:29.50em;height:23.83em;"/></p>
<p>The way you run the code cleanup is by selecting it in the Solution Explorer area, as you can see in the following screenshot. This process will run in all the code files you have:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d7becc52-bd75-441d-9830-4ac3e6abe935.png"/></p>
<p>After solving the errors indicated by the Code Style and Code Cleanup tools, the sample code we are working on has some minimal simplifications, as follows:</p>
<pre>using System;<br/>namespace SampleCodeChapter16<br/>{<br/>    class Program<br/>    {<br/>        static void Main()<br/>        {<br/>            try<br/>            {<br/>                int variable = 10;<br/>                if (variable == 10)<br/>                {<br/>                    Console.WriteLine("variable equals 10");<br/>                }<br/>                else<br/>                {<br/>                    switch (variable)<br/>                    {<br/>                        case 0:<br/>                            Console.WriteLine("variable equals 0");<br/>                            break;<br/>                    }<br/>                }<br/>            }<br/>            catch<br/>            {<br/>            }<br/>        }<br/>    }<br/>}</pre>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the preceding code has many improvements that need to be. Beyond that, Visual Studio enables additional tools for the IDE by installing extensions to it. These tools can help you to improve your code quality since some of them were built to do code analysis. This section will list some free options so that you can decide the one that best fits your needs. There are certainly other options and even paid ones. The idea here is not to indicate a specific tool but to give you an idea of their abilities.</p>
<p>To install these extensions, you will need to find the menu on Visual Studio. Here, you have a screenshot of the Extension Manager:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/8599d004-6a0f-4dd5-9df4-8b67cb8f7c9e.png"/></p>
<p>There are many other cool extensions that can improve the productivity and quality of your code and solution. Do a search for them in this manager.</p>
<p>After you select the extension that will be installed, you will need to restart Visual Studio. Most of them are easy to identify after installation since they modify the behavior of the IDE.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Applying extension tools to analyze code</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Although the sample code delivered after the Code Style and Code Cleanup tools is better than the one we presented at the beginning of the chapter, it is clearly far from the best practices discussed in <a href="82dfe57b-5fe6-4c71-9fa9-b4526a2c6f3e.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Best Practices in Coding C# 8</em>. In the next sections, you will be able to check the behavior of three extensions that can help you evolve this code: Microsoft Code Analysis 2019, SonarLint for Visual Studio 2019, and Code Cracker for Visual Studio 2017.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using Microsoft Code Analysis 2019</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This extension is provided by Microsoft DevLabs and is an upgrade for the FxCop rules that we used to automate in the past. Basically, it has more than 100 rules for detecting problems in the code as you type it.</p>
<p>For instance, just by enabling the extension and rebuilding the small sample we are using in this chapter, Code Analysis found a new issue to solve, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/1dbc1824-4293-436f-8684-e25bbdd53f00.png"/></p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that we discussed the usage of empty <kbd>try-catch</kbd> statements as an anti-pattern in <a href="82dfe57b-5fe6-4c71-9fa9-b4526a2c6f3e.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Best Practices in Coding C# 8</em>. So, it would be really good for the health of the code if this kind of problem could be exposed like this.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Applying SonarLint for Visual Studio 2019</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>SonarLint is an open source initiative from the Sonar Source community to detect bugs and quality issues while you code. There is support for C#, VB .NET, C, C++, and JavaScript. The great thing about this extension is that it comes with explanations to resolve detected issues, and that is why we say developers learn how to code well while using these tools. Check out the following screenshot with the analysis made in the sample code:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/4ea4fa63-d881-422b-b74d-3890dd2583f3.png"/></p>
<p>We can check that this extension was able to point other mistakes and, as they promise, there is an explanation for each warning. This is really useful not only for detecting problems but for training developers in good coding practices.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting Code Cracker for Visual Studio 2017 as a helper to write better code</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Code Cracker is another tool with the same idea of analyzing code using Roslyn. It is an initiative of some Microsoft MVPs and it is open source, too. According to Visual Studio Marketplace, more people are using this tool than any other:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/f8461715-bc09-4a45-b7ee-aaf9f85e0edf.png"/></p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that there are new rules detected in this tool that were not found in the other tools. The reason why there are differences between the code analysis from one extension to others is that probably the rules programmed were not the same.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Checking the final code after analysis</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>After the analysis of the three extensions, we have finally solved all the issues presented. We can check the final code, as follows:</p>
<pre>using System;<br/>namespace SampleCodeChapter16<br/>{<br/>    static class Program<br/>    {<br/>        static void Main()<br/>        {<br/>            try<br/>            {<br/>                int variable = 10;<br/>                if (variable == 10)<br/>                {<br/>                    Console.WriteLine("variable equals 10");<br/>                }<br/>                else<br/>                {<br/>                    switch (variable)<br/>                    {<br/>                        case 0:<br/>                            Console.WriteLine("variable equals 0");<br/>                            break;<br/>                        default:<br/>                            Console.WriteLine("Unknown behavior");<br/>                            break;<br/>                    }<br/>                }<br/>            }<br/>            catch (Exception err)<br/>            {<br/>                Console.WriteLine(err);<br/>            }<br/>        }<br/>    }<br/>}</pre>
<p>As you can see, the preceding code is not only easier to understand, it is safer and is enabled to consider different paths of programming since the default for the <kbd>switch-case</kbd> was programmed. This pattern was discussed in <a href="82dfe57b-5fe6-4c71-9fa9-b4526a2c6f3e.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Best Practices in Coding C# 8</em>, too, which concludes that best practices can be easily followed using one (or all) of the extensions mentioned in this chapter.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Use case – evaluating the C# code before publishing the application</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In <a href="bc26065f-b001-4123-9524-3bbfa87bfadd.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Documenting Requirements with Azure DevOps</em>, we created the WWTravelClub repository in the platform. As we saw there, Azure DevOps enables continuous integration, and this can be really useful. In this section, we will discuss more reasons why the DevOps concept and the Azure DevOps platform are so useful. </p>
<p>For now, the only thing we would like to introduce is the possibility of analyzing code after it is committed by the developers but has not yet been published. Nowadays, in a SaaS world for application life cycle tools, this is only possible thanks to some of the SaaS code analysis platforms that we have. The use case will use Sonar Cloud.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Sonar Cloud is free for open source code and can analyze code stored in GitHub, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps. The registration needs a user for these platforms. As soon as you log in, you can follow the steps described in the following article to create the connection between your Azure DevOps and Sonar Cloud: <a href="https://sonarcloud.io/documentation/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-azure-devops/">https://sonarcloud.io/documentation/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-azure-devops/</a>. </p>
<p>By setting up the connection between your project in Azure DevOps and Sonar Cloud, you will have a build pipeline like the one that follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/a8f416cf-5b49-4049-86a7-3d3473ea33c0.png" style="width:31.50em;height:26.08em;"/></p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that C# projects do not have a GUID number, and this is required by Sonar Cloud. You can easily generate one using this link (<a href="https://www.guidgenerator.com/">https://www.guidgenerator.com/</a>), and it will need to be placed as in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d65f12f2-601a-47fb-9fae-b3f63380b166.png"/></p>
<p>As soon as you finish the build, the result of code analysis will be presented in Sonar Cloud, as you can see in the next screenshot. If you want to navigate down to this project, you can visit: <a href="https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=WWWTravelClub">https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=WWWTravelClub</a>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/e05a3661-fb2d-48c8-a8f5-1a239b7557c0.png"/></p>
<p>Also, by this time, the code analyzed is not in the release yet. So this can be really useful for getting the next step of quality before releasing your system. You can use this approach as a reference for automating code analysis during committal.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This chapter presented tools that can be used to apply the best practices of coding described in <a href="82dfe57b-5fe6-4c71-9fa9-b4526a2c6f3e.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Best Practices in Coding C# 8</em>. We looked at the Roslyn compiler, which enables code analysis at the same time the developer is coding, and we looked at the use case—evaluating the C# code before publishing the application, which implements code analysis during the Azure DevOps building process using Sonar Cloud.</p>
<p>As soon as you apply to your projects everything you have learned in this chapter, the code analysis will give you the opportunity to improve the quality of the code you are delivering to your customer. This is a very important role of a software architect.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will be deploying your application with Azure DevOps.</p>
