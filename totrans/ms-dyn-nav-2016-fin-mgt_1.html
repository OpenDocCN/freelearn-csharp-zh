In many organizations, the salesperson or the purchase department are the ones responsible for generating quotes and orders. People from the finance area are the ones in charge of finalizing the sales and purchase processes by issuing the documents that have an accountant reflection: invoices and credit memos.</p><p>In the past, most systems required someone to translate all the transactions to accountancy language, so they needed a financier to do the job. In Dynamics NAV, anyone can issue an invoice, with zero accounting knowledge needed. But a lot of companies keep their old division of labor between departments. This is why we have decided to explain the sales and purchase processes in this book.</p><p>This chapter explains how their workflows are managed in Dynamics NAV.</p><p>In this chapter, you will learn the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What Dynamics NAV is and what it can offer to your company</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to define the master data needed to sell and purchase</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to set up your pricing policies</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What kind of documents you can issue</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The workflows inside the sales and purchase area</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Introducing Microsoft Dynamics NAV"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec7"/>Introducing Microsoft Dynamics NAV</h1></div></div></div><p>Dynamics NAV is an <span class="strong"><strong>Enterprise Resource Planning</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ERP</strong></span>) system aimed at small and medium-sized companies.</p><p>An ERP is a system, a piece of software, that integrates the internal and external management information across an entire organization. The purpose of an ERP system is to facilitate the flow of information between all business functions inside the boundaries of the organizations. An ERP system is meant to handle all the organization areas on a single software system. This way, the output of an area can be used as an input of another area.</p><p>Dynamics NAV 2016 covers the following functional areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Financial Management</strong></span>: This includes accounting, G/L budgets, account schedules, financial reporting, cash management, receivables and payables, fixed assets, VAT reporting, intercompany transactions, cost accounting, consolidation, multicurrency, and intrastat</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sales and Marketing</strong></span>: This area covers customers, order processing, pricing, contacts, and marketing campaigns</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Purchase</strong></span>: The purchase area includes vendors, order processing, approvals, planning, costing, and other such areas</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Warehouse</strong></span>: In the warehouse area, you will find inventory, shipping and receiving, locations, picking, and assembly</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Manufacturing</strong></span>: This area includes product design, capacities, planning, execution, costing, and subcontracting</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Job</strong></span>: Within the job area, you can create projects, phases and tasks, planning, time sheets, work in process, and other such areas</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Resource Planning</strong></span>: This helps you to manage resources, capacity, and so on.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Service</strong></span>: Within this area, you can manage service items, contracts, order processing, planning and dispatching, and service tasks</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Human Resources</strong></span>: This helps you to manage employees, absences, and so on</li></ul></div><p>Some of these areas will be covered in detail in this book.</p><p>Dynamics NAV offers much more than robust financial and business management functionalities. It is also a perfect platform to customize the solution to truly fit your company's needs. If you have studied different ERP solutions, by now you would know that customizations to fit your specific needs will always be necessary. Dynamics NAV has a reputation as being easy to customize, which is a distinct advantage.</p><p>Since you will probably have customizations in your system, you might find some differences with what is explained in this book. Your customizations could imply the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You have more functionality in your implementation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Some steps are automated, so some manual work can be avoided</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Some features behave different from what they explained here</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There are new functional areas in your Dynamics NAV</li></ul></div><p>In addition, Dynamics NAV has around forty different country localizations that are meant to cover country-specific legal requirements or common practices.</p><p>Many people and companies have already developed solutions on top of Dynamics NAV to cover horizontal or industry-specific needs, and they have registered their solution as an add-on, such as the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Solutions for the retail industry or the food and beverages industry</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Electronic Data Interchange</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>EDI</strong></span>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Quality or maintenance management</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Integration with third-party applications such as electronic shops, data warehouse solutions, or CRM systems</li></ul></div><p>These are just a few examples. You can find almost 2,000 registered third-party solutions that cover all kinds of functional areas. If you feel that Dynamics NAV does not cover your needs and you will need too much customization, the best solution will probably be to look for an existing add-on and implement it along with your Dynamics NAV.</p><p>Anyway, with or without an add-on, we said that you will probably need customizations. How many customizations can you expect? This is hard to tell as each case is particular, but we'll try to give you some highlights.</p><p>If your ERP system covers 100 percent of your needs without any customization, you should worry. This means that your procedures are so standard that there is no difference between you and your competence. You are not offering any special service to your customer, so they are only going to measure you by the price they are getting.</p><p>On the other hand, if your Dynamics NAV only covers a low percentage of your needs, it could just mean two things: this is not the product you need, or your organization is too chaotic and you should re-think your processes to standardize them a bit.</p><p>Some people agree that the ideal scenario would be to get about 70-80 percent of your needs covered out of the box, and about 20-30 percent as customizations to cover those needs that make you different from your competitors.</p><div class="section" title="Importance of Financial Management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec7"/>Importance of Financial Management</h2></div></div></div><p>In order to use Dynamics NAV, all organizations have to use the Financial Management area. It is the epicenter of the whole application. Any other area is optional and their usage depends on the organization's needs. The sales and the purchase areas are also used in almost any Dynamics NAV implementation.</p><p>Actually, accountancy is the epicenter, and the general ledger is included inside the Financial Management area. In Dynamics NAV, everything leads to accounting. It makes sense as accountancy is the act of recording, classifying, and summarizing, in terms of money, the transactions and events that take place in the company.</p><p>Every time the warehouse guy ships an item, or the payment department orders a transfer, these actions can be written in terms of money using accounts, credit, and debit amounts.</p><p>An accountant could collect all the company transactions and translate them one by one to the accounting language. But this means manual duplicate work, a lot of chances of getting errors and inconsistencies, and no real-time data.</p><p>On the other hand, Dynamics NAV is capable of interpreting such transactions and translating them to accountancy on the fly. In Dynamics NAV, everything leads to accountancy, so all the company's employees are helping the financial department with their job. The financers can now focus on analyzing the data and taking decisions, and they don't have to bother on entering the data anymore.</p></div><div class="section" title="Posted data cannot be modified (or deleted)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec8"/>Posted data cannot be modified (or deleted)</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the first things you will face when working with Dynamics NAV is the inability to modify what has been posted, whether it's a sales invoice, a shipment document, a general ledger entry, or any other data. Any posted document or entry is unchangeable.</p><p>This might cause frustration, especially if you are used to working with other systems that allow you to modify data. However, this feature is a great advantage since it ensures data integrity. You will never find an unbalanced transaction.</p><p>If you need to correct any data, the Dynamics NAV approach is to post new entries to null the incorrect ones, and then post the good entries again. For instance, if you have posted an invoice, and the prices were wrong, you will have to post a credit memo to null the original invoice and then issue a new invoice with the correct prices:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Document No.</strong></span>
</p>
</td><td>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Amount</strong></span>
</p>
</td><td>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>Invoice 01</p>
</td><td>
<p>1000</p>
</td><td>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>Credit Memo 01</p>
</td><td>
<p>-1000</p>
</td><td>
<p>This nulls the original invoice</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>Invoice 02</p>
</td><td>
<p>800</p>
</td><td>
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see, this method that is used for correcting mistakes always leaves a track of what was wrong and how we solved it. Users get the feeling that they have to perform too many steps to correct the data with the addition that everyone can see that there was a mistake at some point. Our experience tells us that users tend to pay more attention before they post anything in Dynamics NAV, which leads to making fewer mistakes in the first place.</p><p>So another great advantage of using Dynamics NAV as your ERP system is that the whole organization tends to improve their internal procedures, so no mistakes.</p></div><div class="section" title="No Save button"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec9"/>No Save button</h2></div></div></div><p>Dynamics NAV does not have any kind of <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> button anywhere in the application. Data is saved into the database while it is being introduced. When you enter data in one field, right after you leave the field, the data is already saved. There is no undo feature.</p><p>The major advantage is that you can create any card (for instance, <span class="strong"><strong>customer card</strong></span>), any document (for instance, <span class="strong"><strong>sales order</strong></span>), or any other kind of data without knowing all the information that is needed.</p><p>Imagine you need to create a new customer. You have all their fiscal data except their VAT number. You could create the card, fill in all the information except the VAT Registration No. field, and leave the card without losing the rest of the information. When you have figured out the VAT number of your customer, you can come back and fill it in. The not-losing-the-rest-of-the-information part is important.</p><p>Imagine that there actually was a <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> button; you spend a few minutes filling in all the information and, at the end, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>. At that moment, the system carries out some checks and finds out that one field is missing. It throws you a message saying that the customer card cannot be saved. So you basically have two options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">To lose the information introduced, find out the VAT number for the customer, and start all over again.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">To cheat. Fill the field with some wrong value so that the system actually lets you save the data. Of course, you can come back to the card and change the data once you've found out the right one. But nothing will prevent any other user posting a transaction with the customer in the meantime.</li></ul></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Understanding master data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec8"/>Understanding master data</h1></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Master data</strong></span> is all the key information to the operation of a business. Third-party companies, such as customers and vendors, are part of the master data. The items a company manufactures or sells are also part of the master data.</p><p>Many other things can be considered master data, such as the warehouses or locations, the resources, or the employees.</p><p>The first thing you have to do when you start using Dynamics NAV is loading your master data into the system. Later on, you will keep growing your master data by adding new customers, for instance. To do so, you need to know what kind of information you need to provide.</p><div class="section" title="Customers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Customers</h2></div></div></div><p>We will open a customer card to see what kind of information is stored in Dynamics NAV about customers. To open a customer card, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <code class="literal">Departments/Sales &amp; Marketing/Sales/Customers</code>.</li><li class="listitem">You will see a list of customers, find No. <code class="literal">10000 The Cannon Group PLC</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Double-click on it to open its card, or select it and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> icon found on the <span class="strong"><strong>Home</strong></span> tab of the ribbon.</li></ol></div><p>The following screenshot shows the customer card for <span class="strong"><strong>The Cannon Group PLC</strong></span>:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_01.jpg" alt="Customers"/></div><p>
</p><p>Customers are always referred to by their <span class="strong"><strong>No.</strong></span>, which is a code that identifies them. We can also provide the following information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Name, address, and contact: A <span class="strong"><strong>Search Name</strong></span> can also be provided if you refer to your customer by its commercial name rather than by its fiscal name.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Invoicing information: It includes posting groups, price and discount rates, and so on.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You may still not know what a posting group is, since it is the first time these words are mentioned on this book. At this moment, we can only tell you that posting groups are important. But it's not time to go through them yet. We will talk about posting groups in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6.  Financial Management Setup">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Financial Management Setup</em></span>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Payments information: It includes when and how we will receive payments from the customer.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Shipping information: It explains how to ship items to the customer.</li></ul></div><p>Besides the information you see on the card, there is much other information we can introduce about customers. Take a look at the <span class="strong"><strong>Navigate</strong></span> tab found on the ribbon:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_02.jpg" alt="Customers"/></div><p>
</p><p>The other information that can be entered is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Information about bank accounts</strong></span>: This is so that we know where we can request the payments. Multiple bank accounts can be set up for each customer</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Credit card information</strong></span>: This is in case customers pay using this procedure.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Prepayment information</strong></span>: This is in case you require your customers to pay in advance, either totally or partially</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Additional addresses</strong></span>: This is where goods can be shipped (<span class="strong"><strong>Ship-to Addresses</strong></span>).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Contacts</strong></span>: You may relate to different departments or individuals from your customers</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Relations</strong></span>: This is the relation between our items and the customer's items (cross references)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Prices and discounts</strong></span>: This will be discussed in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Pricing</em></span> section</li></ul></div><p>But customers, just as any other master data record, do not only have information that users inform manually. They have a bunch of other information that is filled in automatically by the system as actions are performed:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>History</strong></span>: You can see it on the right side of the card and it holds information such as how many quotes or orders are currently being processed or how many invoices and credit memos have been issued.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Entries</strong></span>: You can access the ledger entries of a customer through the <span class="strong"><strong>Navigate</strong></span> tab. They hold the details of every single monetary transaction done (invoices, credit memos, payments, and so on).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Statistics</strong></span>: You can see them on the right side and they hold monetary information such as the amount in orders or the amount of goods or services that have been shipped but not yet invoiced.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Balance</strong></span>: This is a sum of all invoices issued to the customer minus all payments received from the customer.</li></ul></div><p>Not all the information we have seen on the customer card is mandatory. Actually, the only information that is required if you want to create a transaction is to give it a <span class="strong"><strong>No.</strong></span> (its identification) and to fill in the posting group's fields (<span class="strong"><strong>Gen. Bus. Posting Group</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Customer Posting Group</strong></span>). All other information can be understood as default information and setup that will be used in transactions so that you don't have to write it down every single time. You don't want to write the customer's address in every single order or invoice, do you?</p></div><div class="section" title="Items"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>Items</h2></div></div></div><p>Now, let's take a look at an item card to see what kind of information is stored in Dynamics NAV about items. To open an item card, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <code class="literal">Departments/Sales &amp; Marketing/Inventory &amp; Pricing/Items</code>.</li><li class="listitem">You will see a list of items.

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_03.jpg" alt="Items"/></div><p>
</p><p>As you can see in the screenshot, items first have a <span class="strong"><strong>No.</strong></span>, which is a code that identifies them. For an item, we can enter the following information:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Description</strong></span>: This is the item's description. A <span class="strong"><strong>Search Description</strong></span> can also be provided if you better identify an item using a different name.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Base unit of measure</strong></span>: This is the unit of measure in which most quantities and other information such as <span class="strong"><strong>Unit Price</strong></span> for the item will be expressed. We will see later what other units of measure can be used as well, but the Base is the most important one and should be the smallest measure in which the item can be referred.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Classification</strong></span>: The <span class="strong"><strong>Item Category Code</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Product Group Code</strong></span> fields offer a hierarchical classification to group items. The classification can fill in the invoicing information we will see in the next point.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Invoicing information</strong></span>: This includes posting groups, the costing method used for the item, and so on.

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_04.jpg" alt="Items"/></div><p>
</p><p>As you can see, the other information that can be entered is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Units of measure</strong></span>: This is useful when you can sell your item either in units, boxes, or other units of measure at the same time.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Variants</strong></span>: This is useful when you have multiple items that are actually the same one (thus, they share most of the information) but with some slight differences.

They work exactly the same way. We will just look at customers, but everything we will explain about them can be applied to vendors as well. Then, we will look at items, and finally, we will take a brief look at locations and resources.</p><p>The concepts learned can be used in resources and locations, and also to other master data such as G/L accounts, fixed assets, employees, service items, and so on.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Pricing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec9"/>Pricing</h1></div></div></div><p>Pricing is the combination of prices for items and resources and the discounts that can be applied to individual document lines or to the whole document.</p><p>Prices can be defined for items and resources and can be assigned to customers. Discounts can be defined for items and documents and can also be assigned to customers.</p><p>Both prices and discounts can be defined at different levels and can cover multiple pricing policies. The following diagram illustrates different pricing policies that can be established in Dynamics NAV:</p><p>

That is, the <span class="strong"><strong>One single price for everyone</strong></span> policy. In that case, the sales price can be specified on the item card or on the resource card, in a field called <span class="strong"><strong>Unit Price</strong></span>.</p><p>In a more complex scenario, where prices depend on different conditions, we will have to define the possible combinations and the resulting price.</p><p>We will explain how prices can be configured for items. Prices for resources can be defined in a similar way, although they offer fewer possibilities.</p><p>To define sales prices for an item, follow these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <code class="literal">Departments/Sales &amp; Marketing/Inventory &amp; Pricing/Items</code>.</li><li class="listitem">You will see a list of items.

When the invoice is posted, it will create an item entry to reduce its stock.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Charge (Item)</strong></span>: This is used to adjust the costs of items. In our example, the freight charges will count as sales amount for the items, and therefore it might adjust the benefit of this particular sale. Charges can be used either on the sales and purchase area, on the same document, or in a different document. You have charged you customer for the freight; your carrier will charge you. When you get your vendor's invoice, you will need to use charges to adjust the cost of the sale.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Resource</strong></span>: It can be employees, machinery, or other company resources.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>G/L accounts</strong></span>: Yes, you can also use G/L accounts in documents.

Let's see them:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>General ledger entries</strong></span>: The system has translated the invoice to accounting language. We selected the customer, so it knew what account from group 23 to use. We sold an Item, so the system knew what income account to use, and so on. Dynamics NAV is capable to choose the right accounts, thanks to some setup tables called <span class="strong"><strong>Posting groups</strong></span>. They are covered in detail in <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Other Financial Functionalities">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Other Financial Functionalities</em></span>:<p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_13.jpg" alt="Documents"/></div><p>
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"/>Note</h3><p>For this book, we used a demonstration company called <span class="strong"><strong>CRONUS Canada Inc.</strong></span>, that uses the British chart of accounts. You can use the general chart of accounts of your country, or you can define a customized one.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>TAX entries</strong></span>: They are created when invoices are posted. They will be used later on to post the VAT Settlement and to report VAT to the authorities:<p>

</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Customer ledger entries</strong></span>: They are used to keep track of all the transactions posted to one customer. Customer ledger entries are also used to manage receivables. The <span class="strong"><strong>Remaining Amount</strong></span> field tells us how much money the customer owes us for this invoice. It will be zero when the invoice is completely paid:<p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_15.jpg" alt="Documents"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Item ledger entries</strong></span>: Since we sold 50 units, we need to decrease the item stock. Item ledger entries help us keep track of the company stock. It also keeps track of the <span class="strong"><strong>Sales Amount</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Cost Amount</strong></span> of this particular entry:<p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_16.jpg" alt="Documents"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Value entries</strong></span>: The <span class="strong"><strong>Sales Amount</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Cost Amount</strong></span> shown in each <span class="strong"><strong>Item Ledger Entry</strong></span> are the sum of their value entries. In future, the cost of this particular item entry might change if we post new item charges or the item gets revaluated. If any of this happens, new value entries will be created:<p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_17.jpg" alt="Documents"/></div><p>
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip12"/>Tip</h3><p>The values entered will be used later on to know the changes in inventory in a period and post it in the general ledger entry.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Resource ledger entries</strong></span>: The resource called <code class="literal">MARK</code> worked 8 hours to assemble the item we sold.

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_18.jpg" alt="Documents"/></div><p>
</p></li></ul></div><p>As you can see, one single invoice has generated 18 different entries in different ledgers. A financer will mainly focus on general ledger and VAT entries, while the warehouse guy will focus on item ledger entries, and the resource manager will focus on resource entries. One single invoice impacts on all areas of the company. So we have demonstrated what was told in the introduction: <span class="emphasis"><em>An ERP system is meant to handle all the organization areas on a single software system. This way, the output of an area can be used as input of another area.</em></span>

<div class="section" title="Document workflows"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Document workflows</h1></div></div></div><p>In the previous section, we have seen what a document is. In this section, we will see how many documents exist in Dynamics NAV, how they are related to each other, and which are the commonly used workflows to create them. We will see sales documents, but the exact same purchase documents exist in Dynamics NAV.</p><p>There are two kinds of document in Dynamics NAV:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Open documents</strong></span>: They hold the information that we will use to start an action or a transaction. An order, for instance, is the beginning of the action of shipping items to our customers. Open documents can be modified.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Posted documents</strong></span>: They hold the result of a transaction that has been posted. They can be understood as historical documents and they cannot be modified. A shipment, for instance, is the result of shipping items to our customers.</li></ul></div><p>The following diagram shows the available documents that exist in Dynamics NAV. There are other warehouse-specific documents that could be used on the sales and purchase processes, but we have skipped them because they are out of the scope of this book:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_19.jpg" alt="Document workflows"/></div><p>
</p><p>Documents in white are open documents, while those in grey are posted documents.</p><p>Not all documents have to be used. Some can be skipped and some may appear multiple times. For example, you could not use <span class="strong"><strong>Quote</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Order</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Shipment</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Return order</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Return receipt</strong></span>, and thus only use <span class="strong"><strong>Invoice</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Posted invoice</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Credit memo</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Posted Cr.Memo</strong></span>. You can also use <span class="strong"><strong>Order</strong></span>, which may lead to multiple <span class="strong"><strong>Shipments</strong></span> (when the order is shipped partially) and then use a single <span class="strong"><strong>Invoice</strong></span> to group all shipments and end up having a single <span class="strong"><strong>Posted Invoice</strong></span>. This scenario is shown in the following diagram:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_20.jpg" alt="Document workflows"/></div><p>
</p><p>Actually, in an invoice, we can group multiple shipments, no matter if they are shipments from the same order or from different orders. There is still another possible workflow, not using invoices and generating the posted invoice from the order:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_01_21.jpg" alt="Document workflows"/></div><p>
</p><p>There are many other possible combinations, since all the workflows we have seen could start with a quote document, for instance. We have not seen different workflows for the sales return path, but the same workflows can be used.</p><div class="section" title="Document approval"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"/>Document approval</h2></div></div></div><p>Dynamics NAV has a document approval functionality that can be applied over open documents to prevent users from posting them (and thus reaching the next document, a posted document) while they have not been approved.</p><p>Document approval can be set up in different ways so that not all documents have to go through an approval process. Only the documents that met certain conditions will actually require someone to approve them. We can decide the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Which kinds of open document will require approval.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The hierarchy of approvers. The hierarchy is based on the maximum amount each approver can approve.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The conditions that should be met to require approval for a specific document.

A simple workflow is the pairing of a single <span class="strong"><strong>Event</strong></span> and a <span class="strong"><strong>Response</strong></span>. For the workflow, we need to perform the following setup:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Set up workflow users:</strong></span> This is used to specify the users' number in a process sequence to receive notification:</li></ul></div><p>
