<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Business processes are all over information systems, and when talking to CEOs, they generally inform the way they see IT: as a way of automating the business processes of the company, providing reliability, repeatability, and – in the best systems – visibility of what happens that brings value to customers, be they internal or external. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">Business processes are at the heart of the company’s information system because each activity is generally ported by an instance of a process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">When the company is certified with ISO 9001, each of the processes in the certified perimeter is precisely documented and its use by each of the actors concerned can be verified in practice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">The processes thus structure the activity of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">the company.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">This chapter details how a clean architecture should behave from the business process point of view by explaining the notions of business process modeling, business activity monitoring, and business process mining, and then by showing how business processes can be used in an IT system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Low-code and no-code approaches are discussed, as well as BPMN-2.0-based approaches. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">Throughout the chapter, we will provide examples to relate the practice to our demonstration information system and make the processes used in IT more concrete. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">Finally, another approach to business processes through service choreography will also </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">be detailed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">In this chapter, we’ll cover the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">following topics:</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor396"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Business processes and the BPMN approach</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">In this first section, we are going to explain in more detail what business processes are and how we can model them with a software approach, using, in particular, a norm called BPMN. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">Before </span><a id="_idIndexMarker599"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">talking about processes in the IT world, it is indeed interesting to come back to the definition of a process from a purely functional point of view, as we always do in this book about </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">business/IT alignment</span><a id="_idTextAnchor397"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor398"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">What is a business process?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">A </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">business process</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1"> is a coordinated </span><a id="_idIndexMarker600"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">set of human and automated actions realized to reach an objective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">The term “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">process</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">” is often replaceable by the almost equivalent “workflow”, which better expresses the fact that the actions (or “tasks”) are actual work that is being done by a human actor or a piece of software and that they are realized in an organized stream (the “flow”) to achieve the business goal that the process </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">aims at.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">As explained in the introduction, business processes are everywhere in an organization, as an “enterprise” is – by definition – a group of people with a means to achieve a goal that cannot be reached alone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Processes are the ways an enterprise achieves these goals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">There is generally a main strategic goal that explains that several processes are, in fact, necessary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.4">For example, the strategic objective of a company may be to become the world leader in the editing and publication of software books. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.5">Its strategy could be, for example, to cover all possible subjects in great detail, by employing many different expert authors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.6">Working out how this is going to be realized requires several smaller, operational objectives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.7">In our example, this means a good recruitment process, since finding the right experts for all the software subjects will require a well-organized approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.8">Another operational process will be the follow-ups of writing, enlisting editors, correctors, proofreaders, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">so on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">This kind of process is the first one we generally think of because it is directly oriented toward the goal, which here is to produce and sell books. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">There are two other kinds of business </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">processes, though:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Support processes</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1"> are all business workflows necessary so that the company goes on working, without being directly related to the goal of the company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">In profit-oriented </span><a id="_idIndexMarker601"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">companies, paying employees’ salaries is not the strategic objective; it is absolutely necessary to keep the company and the processes running, but it is not the reason why the company was created. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">These processes that are not established as goals of the company but are necessary for it to realize these goals are called </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">supporting processes.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">Piloting processes</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> are the ones that deal with the governance and analysis of the other workflows. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">One such workflow is the analysis of the activity indicators </span><a id="_idIndexMarker602"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">of the company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">Another process that can be classified as “piloting” is the management of quality, which covers all operational processes and has the goal of continuously improving how efficient they are. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">Governance or piloting processes, just like support processes, are not directly operational. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.4">The difference with piloting processes is that they sit on top of all other processes, whereas support processes are dependencies for the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">operational proces</span><a id="_idTextAnchor399"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">ses.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor400"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Granularity in the processes</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">As we just saw, there often is a main, high-level, strategic objective for an organization, and several </span><a id="_idIndexMarker603"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">processes are necessary to realize the different lower-level objectives necessary to reach the high-level goal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">When grouping the processes at such a large granularity, we often talk about macro-processes, because they are very general. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">They are easy to define as such because their objective is not a concrete deliverable outcome but a general idea of what a company does. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.4">For example, one could talk about “commerce” and “production” as macro-processes, because their outcomes are very general, respectively getting money from sales and producing goods or services. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.5">It is hard to say how we could really achieve this </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">in detail.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">When talking about business processes, in contrast to macro-processes, the outcome is quantifiable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">For example, producing a car is a business process because we can count how many cars leave the factory in a week. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">Writing software is another example of a business process because the outcome is the release of a piece of software, together with the ways to exploit it (documentation, setup software, etc.). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.4">The tasks that compose the business processes are associated with a type of actor, such as “assembling the engine,” “writing the summary of the book,” or “producing a commercial quote.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.5">This is how they differ from macro-process where a single part of the process can necessitate many different profiles, such as “product marketing” or “invoicing”. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.6">Units inside a macro-process can be business processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.7">In our editing example, the macro-process of “producing books” needs a business process to recruit authors, another one to supervise their writing, and yet another one to correct </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">the book.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">The same idea </span><a id="_idIndexMarker604"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">of level-based decomposition and granularity of processes can be observed one level down, by decomposing the different items of a business process into detailed steps, which themselves constitute another process, this time a fine-grained one, often called a “procedure”. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">This time, the procedure not only states the tasks that have got to take place for each actor, but the precise operation that each of them has to carry out to realize a given task of the business process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">For example, inside the business process of “selling a book”, there may be a task called “sending an invoice”. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.4">A detailed procedure for this task would be, for example, composed of the following “elements </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">of procedure”:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Every month, list all the customers that have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">ordered books.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">For each customer, gather all books and quantities that have been sent from the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">stock database.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Check that the packages have indeed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">been sent.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Verify the discount agreement with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">this customer.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Calculate the total amount due for the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">books sent.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Subtract possible credits that the customer may have due to book returns </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">or warranties.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Enter all this data into the “</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">invoice” template.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Print two copies and store one at the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">accounting office.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Send out the other copy to the customer using its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">billing address.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">This last example may seem a little bit old-fashioned in the virtual world we live in today, filled with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, selling only e-books and ordering/invoicing online. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">The reason why this example is used is two-fold. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">First, as has been explained previously, it is always interesting in business/IT alignment to consider a problem by removing anything related to IT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.4">This allows us to concentrate only on the functional problem and understand it in its most intricate details before thinking about implementing it technically. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.5">This way, software-based hypotheses, which can lead to coupling, are left out of the scope, at least in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">first analysis.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">The second reason </span><a id="_idIndexMarker605"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">for showing such an old procedure is to illustrate how the software implementation of business processes has led us to almost forget them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">There are good chances that when reading this list of steps, you thought, “No one does this manually anymore.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">And you would be right: all these operations are mostly done by ERPs and dedicated invoicing software applications nowadays. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">But… there has to be at least one person who knows about these steps, and this is the person who will design these software applications! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.5">As this is what this book is about, it is important – once again – to start from a pure and correct understanding of the business aspects before trying to implement them in an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">information system.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Also, establishing this detailed procedure before automating it will allow you to gain some insights from business experts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">For example, someone from accounting will tell you that you forgot about multiple VAT rates you will have to deal with if you want to sell internationally. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Another person will add that credits should not be taken into account if the customer has a debt towards you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">Yet another colleague may argue that, in some cases, the payer for the order might be a different legal person than the one who should receive the invoice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.5">And </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">so on…</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">The very principle of processes containing some other processes as detailed explanations of a single task is one of the important concepts in the business process modeling approach and we will see in this chapter how this can be detailed in a formalized way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">The three main levels are macro-processes, business processes, and procedure but, depending on the context, some other levels </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">may </span><a id="_idTextAnchor401"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">appear.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor402"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Limits of the processes</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">If you have been exposed to business processes in an organization as an actor in a given task, there are </span><a id="_idIndexMarker606"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">strong chance that you have a bad opinion about them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">Business processes have suffered from a bad reputation because of many badly-led implementations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">There are many ways of missing the point with processes and doing more harm than good, but let’s start with the way that works. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.4">If you want to improve your organization with process management, the very first rule is that the processes should always reflect what happens </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">in reality.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">This might sound obvious at the beginning of the process design: most process designers will start by looking at what happens in the organization to draw up the process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">Yet, there still are some organization leaders who think they know better how operational people work and will create a process that is not based on reality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">This, of course, leads to useless processes, and this is why Gemba is one of the important concepts in the Lean method, designating the place where the value is created. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.4">In industrial organizations, that means going to the factory floor to understand what </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">really happens.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">Another fallacy is to believe that, once the process is well established, improvements will flow from optimizing its representation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">This is a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">much-observed sequence:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">A process analyst observes the work of an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">operational team.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">The process is drawn up and correctly reflects the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">actual work.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">The process analyst detects a possible optimization in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">the process.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">An improved version of the process </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">is designed.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">The team goes on working with the existing process and no improvement is observed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">in reality.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">This is simply another case where one forgets that the process should always reflect what happens in reality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">The process analysis might find some place for improvement but the only way to achieve improvement is when the operational team takes this into account and discerns – by itself and within its own organization – how to alter its way of working to avoid the problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.3">Once this is done (and most of the time, the solution found by the team will be different from the one imagined by the solution analyst), the process should be updated to account for the modification done by the operational team and to keep on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">reflecting it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">The worst that can happen is when a business analyst has hierarchical power over the operational team and tries to force them into following a process that comes out of pure analysis and does not come from operational observation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Except purely randomly, there is no chance this process will have a positive effect and improve the way that people actually work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.3">What will happen is the contrary: working with an unadapted process will lower the operational team’s morale and increase the likelihood of people going around </span><a id="_idIndexMarker607"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">the process, or even failing to realize the task by finding a flaw in the process and voluntarily acting on it to show how bad the process is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">Sounds crazy, doesn’t it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">Yet it happens every day in many companies, simply because people use processes in a bad way, thinking that theoretically knowing them can lead to an improvement “on paper.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.4">Processes get a bad reputation in this kind of situation, where they are thought to be more important or more correct than the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">actors themselves.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">Again, processes can only be a representation of what happens in a real, concrete organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">They may be a great tool to uncover bottlenecks, design solutions, and even in some cases simulate them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">But the only reality always comes from the factory floor and processes can never be more than a useful representation of people’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">act</span><a id="_idTextAnchor403"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">ual work.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor412"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">Principles</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">The principles of business process execution are very simple: a piece of software called a BPM </span><a id="_idIndexMarker624"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">engine reads the XML-based BPMN-compliant representation of a business process and can start as many “instances” of this process as you wish. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.2">Once started, an instance will roughly have the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">following behavior:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">The instance is saved on disk or to a database, and instances can be read and modified at the different steps of their development, which correspond to the advancement in the tasks that constitute </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">the processes.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">Each instance of a given process is completely separated from the other instances, though they execute the same process definition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">How the process is executed in the instances may radically differ depending on how gateways </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">are passed.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">Once started, an instance follows the process as it was designed at its moment of creation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.2">If the process design evolves afterwards, all running instances will go on with the old version, in order to keep </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">workflow consistency.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">Every task in the flow is “executed” by the engine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.2">The actual execution of the step depends on its type and on how the engine is configured to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">handle it:</span></span><ul><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">When a service task is reached, the execution is supposed to be automatic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.2">An API can be called or a connector to an application, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">so on.</span></span></li><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">When a manual task is reached, the engine warns the user that something needs to be done by them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.2">This can be done by a notification through email or any other channel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.3">When the user has finished the task, they are usually invited to inform the BPM engine about this, so that the execution of the instance of the process can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">go on.</span></span></li><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">When a user task is reached, the user is also informed but since the action expected is to fill in a form or at least realize something on a machine, a pointer to the required form can be provided in order to speed up </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">the action.</span></span></li></ul></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">If the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker625"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">engine encounters a gateway, it will react differently depending on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">its type:</span></span><ul><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">If this is a parallel gateway, all subsequent tasks will be run and the engine will take care of waiting for all paths to finish before running the rest of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">the process.</span></span></li><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">If this is an exclusive gateway, the decision engine (we will come back to this in more detail in the next chapter) will be activated and the execution of the business rules will define which branch should </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">be taken.</span></span></li></ul></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">On some advanced engines, notifications can be designed in order for stale process instances to emit a warning to a functional administrator, in order for them to get </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">things done.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">When the end event is reached, the process instance is considered as finished and archived. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.2">It is not possible to execute anything in it, but it is kept for statistics or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">tr</span><a id="_idTextAnchor413"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">aceability reasons.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">The best </span><a id="_idIndexMarker626"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">way to comprehend a technology is with examples, and this is why we have followed an example of information system design from the beginning of the book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.2">Let’s come back to </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">DemoEditor</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1"> and take a look at what business processes could be designed – and maybe </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">even automated.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">Now is the good time to come back to a notion that had hitherto been covered a bit too swiftly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.2">When talking about how complex diagrams featuring multiple participants are cut into “swimlanes” in a “pool” that the process represents, the notion of “actor” was introduced </span><a id="_idIndexMarker629"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">to explain that each of these lanes had to be associated (and, by convention, named after) an “actor.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.2">It may sound like we are talking about a user, but an actor is more generic than this and should rather be associated with a group of users (what some would call a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">profile</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">, even if this </span><a id="_idIndexMarker630"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">word is normally used to designate cohesive sets of authorizations, as in the “role” semantics in the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">Role-Based Access </span></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">Control</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1"> paradigm).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">In the two preceding examples of BPMN diagrams (</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">Figures</span></em> <em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">11.9</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1"> and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">11.10</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">), the actors were </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">Editor</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1"> and </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">Author</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.2">In the user directory, groups with equivalent names would normally be found. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.3">A good BPMN engine always includes a user directory supporting groups of users – or even better, can be plugged into a central enterprise directory, using for example the standardized LDAP protocol. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.4">This allows a level of indirection as when talking about the functional process, which specific author or editor we are referring to makes no difference. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.5">In the first example, a given editor will receive an agreement for enrollment and will then send a request for information to a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">given author.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">It is important to understand this notion correctly and not to couple it too much to the user’s directory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.2">Associating a BPMN actor/swimlane with a group is the most logical approach, but the coupling should not be too hard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.3">For example, if it is decided at some point that only a few senior editors can start a contract, the process engine should be able to implement this without being dependent on the user’s directory to create a new group for these privileged editors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.4">Of course, it is more elegant if this is the situation, but again, a technical prerequisite should never block a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">functional request.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">The moment </span><a id="_idIndexMarker631"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">when a process is instantiated is also important from the point of view of the actors’ selection. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.2">The choice of which precise user will correspond to the generic definition of an actor in a “swimlane” will generally be realized upon instantiation of the process in the BPM engine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.3">Most engines will show a dialog asking for who precisely in their user directory will be associated with this or that actor/lane in the process pool. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.4">Some even allow the definition of default user affectation or rules to select users depending on other elements of context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.5">For example, we could have a </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">DemoEditor</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1"> process that would automatically select the editor associated with an author when the latter sends its</span><a id="_idTextAnchor417"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1"> manuscript </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">for review.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">As we saw, the norms and standards have existed for quite a long time, and the BPMN engines are there, up and ready for global use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.2">Yet, the overall use of BPMN in the industry is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker638"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">very small. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.2">Apart from some very large companies, and only within dedicated perimeters, the use of BPMN-based automated processes is very scarce, although there is no problem in terms of the price or complexity of the norm. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.3">In fact, lots of implementations are free and the norm is quite easy to learn, even for a non-technical person. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.4">Actually, it may even be one of the easiest norms to understand for business-oriented people, as it represents their everyday job (at least when used properly). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.5">So why do so few </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">use it?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">One of the reasons may be that automating a process does not bear so much value in many cases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.2">Indeed, setting up a BPM engine is quite a complex task and is only worth it when this investment is compensated either by an important complexity of the process (BPMN drawn up by business specialists and executed “blindly” by the software) or by frequent changes in the process definition (which makes it interesting to delegate execution to a generic engine, as this will allow the rest of the software to remain stable). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.3">And when you think about it, lots of business processes are not such frequently moving objects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.4">The process of sending invoices does not change every month and all regulation-associated processes tend to be quite stable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.5">Even operational processes do not change much more often than new versions of applications </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">are released.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">Another reason is that designing a process inside a BPMN file tends to add rigidity to it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.2">In lots of organizations, processes are not so clear and depend a lot on how humans execute them, sometimes not respecting a common way of doing so, and most of the time finding a creative way to the process objective, which is – in the end – the only thing that really matters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.3">Sure, this might upset some managers who love the feeling of control that processes can provide. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.4">But this is also one of the drawbacks of processes that was explained previously in this chapter: when they tend to replace human choice, they not only bring down team morale but also reduce productivity while trying to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">increase it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">Or maybe the reason for BPM engines’ low use is just that BPMN remains a bit complicated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.2">Of course, the basics of the BPMN 2.0 standard are very easy to understand and apply (a box for each task, a lane for each actor, and arrows between tasks to show the stream of activities) but the rest of the norm can require much more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">intellectual engagement.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">All in all, BPMN 2.0 is not used as widely as it should be because it could really bring more value </span><a id="_idIndexMarker639"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">to the IT industry if it was better known and widespread. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.2">This is why we need to try other solutions, and this is what the last section of this chapter is about showcasing some alternatives that may be used as a lighter replacement of BPM, hopefully giving it a new boost, even though not based on the BPMN 2.0 standard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.3">But before that, we are going to digress just a little bit on other operations that can be performed using BPM – process execution is definitely the most advanced one, but not the only one that</span><a id="_idTextAnchor421"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1"> can deliver </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">operational value.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">Apart from the promise of automated execution (which brings repeatability and uniformity), BAM is the most sought-after feature that brings managers to BPMN. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.2">The reason behind this is that managers need indicators to understand how their business behaves. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.3">And what better indicators could they have than metrics directly borne by their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">business processes?</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">You might have </span><a id="_idIndexMarker664"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1">not realized but, if you have ever created a software </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1">Graphical User Interface</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">GUI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">), chances are you have implemented a process without even realizing it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.2">All wizards, for example, are processes since they chain screens in order to provide a way to add data in a sequential order. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.3">The most complex </span><a id="_idIndexMarker665"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">ones allow choices, which are the perfect equivalent of gateways in BPMN. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.2">They also have a beginning and an end, like any process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.3">Wizards are very similar to processes, but when we take the simple definition of a business process as a series of human and automated tasks organized to reach an objective, then any GUI is indeed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">a process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">Every GUI allows human interactions that are always the start of a simple process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.2">This process will collect data through forms, and then run some “service” tasks by calling a backend in order to execute some commands. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.3">Like wizards, the behavior of the GUI will change depending on business rules or values specified in forms (again, like gateways) and the end of the process will generally be signaled by a toast notification, a dialog box, or simply the fact that the GUI waits for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">another interaction.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">You could argue that a process in the GUI is really a human process where the user follows a process within the software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.2">However, a good GUI leads the user into a particular way of using it that tends to mimic the business process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.3">This is obvious in the case of a wizard, but it also happens in a GUI that has been designed with UX competency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.4">Of course, in the simplest interfaces like a command line, a very large part – if not all – of the process execution is in the hands of the user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.5">But the simple fact that arguments are named after data collected by the BPMN process is</span><a id="_idTextAnchor433"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1"> already a help in respecting the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1">represented workflow.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">While we are at simple solutions to the orchestration question, having dedicated APIs that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker666"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">implement an organized sequence of calls to other, simpler, APIs is also a documented approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.2">In fact, this is a well-known API structure, organizing them in three layers, each building on the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1">one below:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.1">The first level is the CRUD APIs, which are used to manipulate and read a single business entity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.2">This is the kind of API that we talked about in the previous chapter when explaining the concept of MDM and showing how it could be implemented with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.1">REST APIs.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.1">The second level is about APIs that compose several first-level API calls in order to realize a complex operation in the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.2">For example, one such API could be exposed as </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.1">/api/contract</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.1"> and its </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.1">POST</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.1"> verb implementation could call </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.1">GET</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.1"> on </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.1">/api/authors</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.1"> to verify the author is already registered, then make a </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1">POST</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.1"> call to the same API if this is not the case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.2">After that, the code would call the service dedicated to proposing a contract amount, then finally reach the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1">/api/pdf-fusion</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1"> service in order to retrieve the address of the document created and sent to the electronic document management system (of course, using the CMIS standard). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.2">At any time where a failure happens, this implementation would have rules to know what it should do and, in the worst case, would provide notifications to a human to clean up the remaining situations that are too complex for the computer </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1">to resolve.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">The third level is used to adjust APIs to their callers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.2">This time, they do not necessarily compose several calls but rather add some arguments to the request, adjust and filter some content to the response, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.3">These tertiary APIs are typically used to provide a “backend for a frontend” and, for example, adjust the default pagination and sets of attributes retrieved for a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">mobile application.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">When using an API gateway to include general features such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and counting accesses for invoices, the server used can be considered as another level, but it does not sit on top of the three levels described above. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.2">Since it can be used to expose any level, a better representation is to show it on the side of the three levels of business-oriented APIs, providing a technical coating </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">for them:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">As you can see from the examples chosen in this schema, APIs on different levels do not necessarily use different expositions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.2">For example, it could be decided that the API exposing the authors together with their past books uses the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">/api/authors</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1"> route just like </span><a id="_idIndexMarker667"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">the CRUD API exposition of the authors alone does. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.2">One rationale for this would be to respect the Open Data Protocol standard, and in particular, the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1">$expand</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1"> grammar that is well adapted to this case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.2">The API would nonetheless be a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.1">second-level one.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.1">One of the advantages of this approach to implementing a business process inside an API is that it greatly respects the principle of single responsibility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.2">A drawback is that the implementation will either be in code, which is more difficult to evolve, or with a BPMN engine but, in this case, this creates some coupling to a technology. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.3">There of course is a bit of coupling when choosing a BPMN engine, but using it in many API implementations definitely increases this level of dependency </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.1">on it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.1">Now that we have shown two “simple” ways to implement business processes in software, let’s analyze some more complex ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.2">We will start with dedicated middleware servers, which we previously talke</span><a id="_idTextAnchor435"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.1">d about in the context of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.567.1">service-oriented architecture.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.1">You might look at this last sentence, as I recommend introducing business functions inside </span><a id="_idIndexMarker671"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.1">the middleware, while I stated in </span><a href="B21293_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor344"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1">Chapter 10</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1"> that all business rules should always be inside the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker672"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1">MDM service associated with the entity bearing it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.2">Is there a possible paradox here? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.3">In fact, there is not if you make use of the Single Responsibility Principle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.4">When talking about business functions that are the responsibility of a given service, it is important that the services are clearly made responsible for each function. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.5">For example, if an accounting service needs the net price for a book and the book service only contains the raw price without VAT, it is important not to take the easy path of applying the VAT rate inside the middleware simply because it is quicker and will avoid a change and the deployment of a new version of the book MDM service. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.6">The books and all their attributes are clearly under the responsibility of the books referential service, another attribute has to be added to the list of what it exposes (which does not harm backward compatibility, so should not have any impact if clients are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">correctly written).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.1">On the other hand, let’s say that when an editor decides a book should be discontinued, the command should delete the reference from the CRM and from the commercial website, but also set the status of the book to </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">archived</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1"> in the books referential service. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.2">Clearly, the action will be sent to the book referential service first, but who should decide about the other actions? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.3">We could ask the data referential service to send a message to the CRM and the website, but that would make a clear coupling with these applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.4">Neither the CRM nor the website should be in control of this interaction since none of them is supposed to be responsible for what happens at the book entity level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.5">The responsibility of this grouped set of commands is not unique, and thus hard to give to a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.1">single service.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.1">How the middleware solves this is by providing another application that is responsible for these “orchestration” tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.2">It sits on top of messages and has only the responsibility of handling them and routing them to whatever service needs them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.3">Note that the middleware application does not know anything about the content of the message; it simply takes care of the fact that a </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.1">DELETE</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.1"> operation on </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.1">/api/books</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.1"> should be sent to the book MDM service, the CRM, and the website. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.2">What they do with it is none of its business. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.3">Of course, there are details that should be sorted out. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.4">For example, how should </span><a id="_idIndexMarker673"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.1">the middleware react if one of the services sends an error? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.2">Is it its responsibility to cancel the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker674"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.1">transaction and ask other services to roll back what they have done? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.2">These questions will be addressed a bit further on in this section but, for now, keep in mind the old proverb “dumb pipes, smart endpoints”: the middleware should never embed any business rules other than pure orchestrat</span><a id="_idTextAnchor437"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.1">ion, which is the simple dispatch of messages and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.1">nothing else.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor438"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.1">Low-code/no-code approaches to processes</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.1">You have almost certainly heard about the low-code/no-code movement in the industry lately. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.2">The idea behind these approaches is that specialized platforms can make it possible for </span><a id="_idIndexMarker675"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.1">non-developers to create </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.610.1">Line-Of-Business </span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.1">(</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.612.1">LOB</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.1">) software applications by removing most or all code and proposing visual editors to create forms, workflows, data structures, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.2">In a way, they contain </span><a id="_idIndexMarker676"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.1">everything that is necessary to create a complete system, just like the utopic system we talked about does. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.2">The difference resides in the fact that they do so with graphical editors and the user never has to type a line of text-based code (or almost, in the low-code approach, as opposed to the no-code approach that demands that not a single line of code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.1">is typed).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.1">Lots of polemics have surrounded these approaches and their associated platforms, some presenting them as a revolution allowing the appearance of the “citizen developer”, and others explaining that the code logic and algorithms are still there, simply in a non-textual form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.2">For them, these platforms are not much more than the next avatar of an old promise that went over code generation, fourth-generation frameworks, previous approaches of graphical integrated development platforms… and of course, all the applications that have been created with the most versatile tool ever, which is Excel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.3">As an architect, I try to step away from these opinions and stay focused on the kind of value that such tools </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.617.1">can bring.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.1">In particular, better tooling may be an answer to the difficulty expressed above on the limited use of BPMN engines in the industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.2">Just like MOMs, BPMN engines are quite complex systems and require some setup, maintenance, and expertise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.3">With its focus on the simplicity of use by non-developers (I was about to write “non-technical persons,” but that would be far-fetched, as you definitely require a technically oriented mind to use them), perhaps the low-code/no-code tools could be a way to provide an easy-to-use orchestration that would allow the business process execution approach to become more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.1">widely used?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.620.1">This </span><a id="_idIndexMarker677"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.621.1">could happen in two different ways, depending on the kind of tools one uses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.621.2">The first family of tools is the easiest one to use for process automation: namely, platforms that are data-driven. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.621.3">As the ideal information system clearly separates MDM and business process management (and business rules management), that may sound a bit weird, but the concept of reification will help get out of this separation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.621.4">The word “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.622.1">reification</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.623.1">” means the making of something into a concrete entity, typically a relationship between two entities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.623.2">In the case of processes, they can be seen as a series of tasks that contribute to acquiring data, but we could also apply reification and consider that an instance of the process itself is data, after all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.623.3">This is how data-driven no-code systems, such as Airtable for example, deal with business processes: they simply store data about the process in their data structures, each line corresponding to an instance of a process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.623.4">In addition, this is made easier by the fact that most simple processes target mainly one business entity, which means that the process and the associated entity can simply be turned into the same entity, managed by the MDM that Airtable and the like </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.1">actually are.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.625.1">For example, let’s model a process of onboarding for Human Resources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.625.2">The target entity is an employee which concerns the onboarding process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.625.3">We will thus simply create a data structure for these onboarded employees, and complete it with data that is more process-oriented, typically the date of entry (beginning of the process), the date of full integration (end of the onboarding process), the URL to the picture that has been taken of the new employee on their first day at work, maybe a pointer to the signed document of IT charts they were required to approve, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.625.4">As you can see, data from the processes and data about the employees themselves sometimes have blurred boundaries. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.625.5">For example, the date of joining the company is the start of the onboarding process, but this remains important data for the employee long after the end of the onboarding process, as it is used by HR to calculate how many additional vacation days the person receives (determined by how long they have been with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.626.1">the company).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.627.1">There is a second family of tools that can be classified as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.1">no code</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.1"> since they allow graphical-only operations: these are the light orchestration tools such as Zapier, IFTTT, and many others that are similar in their use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.2">These platforms allow us to create simple interactions by binding an event (for example, when a GMail account receives an email with an attachment) to an action (storing the file in a OneDrive account, under a given directory named </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.1">Pictures</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.2">The GUI to create these interactions can go a bit further, for example by allowing an intermediate task that will filter files based on their extensions and stop if the attachment detected does not end with </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.632.1">.png</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.1"> or </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.1">.jpg</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.635.1">, but this </span><a id="_idIndexMarker678"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.1">will generally be the most sophisticated use you can have. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.2">This limitation is compensated for by providing lots of connectors to third-party platforms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.3">I cited Google Mail and Microsoft OneDrive in the example, but there are hundreds or thousands of editors that have made their applications accessible with these tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.4">Exposing a public API is generally a prerequisite to doing so, and we will see shortly that webhooks can also be very </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.1">useful here.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.1">In this case, if there is a failure in SharePoint, not only will the process be down, but also all the features implemented by this server. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.2">And since they are most likely used by many other business processes in your organization, the SPOF now carries more risk than ever. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.3">Of course, Microsoft has a very robust implementation of SharePoint 365, but you may lose </span><a id="_idIndexMarker685"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.1">internet access. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.2">And if you think you will be better off running SharePoint locally, think again because you will never reach the level of robustness Microsoft can provide for its own solution, however gifted your admins are. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.3">So how can we get rid of this SPOF problem for the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.1">process execution?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.1">One radical answer to this problem is to simply eliminate all kinds of centralized authority and keep only what is absolutely necessary for the messages to flow between the services, which is a network connection. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.2">That may sound quite harsh but, after all, if we really want dumb pipes, how much dumber can they be than simple TCP/IP packets? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.3">HTTP and in particular, HTTPS, will add some welcomed low-level features such as streaming encryption and receipt acknowledgment, but they will remain completely agnostic from the business point of view, which is what we define </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.1">as “dumb”.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.1">Eliminating any centralized orchestration is realized by setting up what is called “choreography.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.2">In the orchestration approach, just like in musical orchestras, there is a leader who directs the rhythm and tone of all instruments from a physically centralized position. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.3">In choreography, a group of dancers does not follow a single leader, but each adjusts by observing their neighbors, just like in flocks of birds or fish. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.4">For example, when moving left, a dancer will stare at the feet of their left neighbor; then, when going right, they will synchronize with the dancer on the other side. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.5">In these groups, there is no “main dancer” but only a group that is used to working together. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.6">By the way, this means that there still is some kind of leader: when learning their choreography, a choreographer </span><a id="_idIndexMarker686"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.1">will explain the expected moves to the group of dancers, show how they can synchronize, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.2">Practice will then make it so that, once dancing is “in production,” the team will no longer need a choreographer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.3">This goes the same in IT choreography: you need an architect to tell each service what signal they should listen to and what their reaction should be. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.4">But once set up, the system is on its own and the architect can simply monitor that everything is going </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.695.1">as expected.</span></span></p>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.1">The signing book would wait for a signal that a new document was stored and would use the business rule to filter documents that need to be signed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.2">This could be done in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.1">two ways:</span></span><ul><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.1">The signing book could get all the documents and decide by itself depending on the metadata whether the document needs to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.707.1">be signed.</span></span></li><li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.1">Even better, if the EDM application supports this, it could tell this application to only notify it for specific documents by registering with a “filter expression” that the EDM could apply. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.2">This would reduce bandwidth and improve performance, as only documents actually requiring a signature would be notified to the signing book </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.1">for handling.</span></span></li></ul></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.710.1">The EDM would also wait for signals from the signing book software (just like it would for signals coming from the OCR platform) and store the signed document when such an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.1">event happens.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.712.1">The great </span><a id="_idIndexMarker687"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.1">thing about not having an SPOF is that all parts not concerned by a failure will continue to work in the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.2">For example, if, for one reason or another, the signing book software is not available (let’s say it is a SaaS application and your internet connection is down), the rest of the process will work fine: documents that do not need any signature will simply be sent to the EDM and stored; the problem will only be that documents needing to be signed would not be presented for signature (but they would still be stored in the EDM in their original form). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.3">We will see a bit further in this section that we could even put in place a “safety net” so that events are not lost and documents</span><a id="_idTextAnchor441"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.714.1"> to be signed eventually reach the signing book once it is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.715.1">back online.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.1">One of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker688"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.718.1">the most logical and least-coupled ways to implement this kind of choreographic approach is to use webhooks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.718.2">We talked about webhooks in </span><a href="B21293_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor271"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.719.1">Chapter 8</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.1"> already and saw they are a great way to invert the order of service. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.2">In the context of choreography, webhooks are a great way to eliminate all centralized orchestration, since the responsibilities are shared between two components only: the emitter and the receiver. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.3">The emitter can store requests for callbacks on certain events and takes care of sending a message to these callback URLs when the business event happens in their service. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.4">On the other hand, the receiver needs to register for the emitter’s events it wants to know about, provide a callback URL and listen to it, and deal with the message once it arrives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.5">Almost everything (we will see later that a few things </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.1">are</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.722.1"> missing) is handled by those </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.723.1">two participants.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.1">Then why do platforms like Zapier or IFTTT exist, you might ask? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.2">Simply because webhooks and business events are not standardized yet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.3">OpenAPI version 3.0.2 supports webhook definitions, but it is not complete yet and very few editors support it for now. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.4">And it will definitely take a long time to define some standards for technical events, let alone business-oriented ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.5">What Zapier and the like bring to the game is a centralized market of proprietary connectors to hundreds of LOB applications, and this is why </span><a id="_idIndexMarker689"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.1">they are still in the game. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.2">Their value can also be in simple flows that could be implemented with only a webhook plugged into an API, because using them in the middle provides you with monitoring, error detection, automatic retries, and notifications of durable failures, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.1">among others.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.727.1">But in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker690"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.1">pure theory, it would be possible to implement your </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.729.1">Event-Driven Architecture</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.730.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.731.1">EDA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.732.1">) (this is the accepted jargon to define this generalized approach) simply by registering webhooks on all the services in your information system, telling them to call back APIs exposed by others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.732.2">This would however require that all messages be standardized and a global convention on defining all available business events </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.733.1">to exist.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.1">As always, the devil lies in the details, and everything would work fine in such an ideal EDA system until a packet is lost by the dumb pipes, or a network card goes down. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.2">Since everything is synchronous and in memory, such a technical incident would result in a functional loss, with potential business impacts, low or catastrophic, depending on what has been lost. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.3">This is of course something that cannot be tolerated in an industry-grade system and the reason why, for important data streams, it is a good idea to keep some kind of middleware, such as a message-queuing system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.4">The principle is to keep the pipes dumb, though, and this is where it gets difficult because, once a distributed broker is set up, it is hard to restrain its use to just orchestration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.5">There may be good reasons to do so because this approach can be more adapted to other contexts than the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.735.1">choreography-based one.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.736.1">Queuing systems will allow for the robust delivery of messages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.736.2">If you also need the ability to go back in time and do some event sourcing (such as for CQRS, in order to implement Big Data complex calculation, or even to ease eventual consistency), then you may go as far as deploying specialized distributed systems such as Apache Kafka. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.736.3">Again, this is quite a heavy machinery to pull up, so be particularly careful with the balance between losing messages from time to time (and we really are talking about infrequent events, as modern networks are much more resilient than their ancestors) and paying for all the extra cost of a middleware (as a rule of thumb, you can consider that an average-sized middleware will cost you one Full-Time Equivalent). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.736.4">Remember in particular that even huge players in e-commerce accept the loss of consistency and implement many strategies to reduce the consequences (limited time to retain a basket, stock management and acceptance of reservation only if there is enough stock, improved reimbursement if the lock of the product </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.737.1">failed, etc.).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.738.1">Again, remember that functional alignment is key. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.738.2">When thinking about how dangerous it is to miss an event, do not take a technical approach that will immediately draw you into firing </span><a id="_idIndexMarker691"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.739.1">up the big guns; think only in functional terms, imagining an information system without any piece of software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.739.2">How could you compensate for this? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.739.3">Maybe one way would be that the next time you receive an order event, you check with the emitter that all orders that have been passed since the indicated date and time; normally, there should only be the one that triggered the event but if you missed the previous one, you are now informed about it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.739.4">Another way to implement consistency could be to double the webhook approach with an automated job that will query all new orders every five minutes and verify they have indeed been treated as they should. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.739.5">If you really want to take it to the next level, you could even set up a self-healing system that clones all important data from its neighboring services and only reacts to time-based and interaction-based events to perform its duties, while always keeping and communicating a value date on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.740.1">its operations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.1">When I talk about this functional-first approach with software architects, they generally tend to reply that a good transactional system will take care of consistency, allowing us to get rid of these functional complications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.2">Or that Apache Kafka is best for this kind of problem and will be the solution – sometimes without having a documented estimation of the cost of such solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.3">Though this can be acceptable at times (again, it all depends on the context), getting the deepest possible understanding of the business always brings value to a software architect. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.4">One should also remember that, even though the technical approach seems to cover perfectly the difficulties, there is always a way to fail as well, and this should be taken into account (this danger is high when these technologies are SPOFs). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.5">On the other hand, when you have a clear understanding of how functionally consistent your system has to be, failure is included in the debate and thus cannot cause surprises anymore. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.742.1">The functional approach is the only way to solve a problem as </span></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.743.1">a whole.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.744.1">If you are interested in digging into this deeper, a good starting point is to understand how sagas work (quickly said, sagas are a way to re-create transactions when you have separated your persistence into several databases, as the MDM and SRP propose to do in order to reduce coupling). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.744.2">The great article at </span><a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.1">https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.746.1"> shows how to implement them with orchestration and choreography. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.746.2">Please note, though, that in both cases a MOM is necessary, so we still return to the same conclusion: since transactions are a technical solution, they cannot fully cover a functional problem; if you really want a global solution, you have to provide a fully functional solution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.746.3">In this case, this is about finding business rules for eventual consistency and implementing them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.746.4">As you are probably used to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker692"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.1">doing by now, the best way to find this functional solution is to imagine an office without any computer: how would you go about ensuring consistency over a complex workflow, for example, a business case that requires two people working in sequence? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.2">Most simply, you would alternate synchronous calls with asynchronous callbacks: “Here is the file, call me when you are done.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.3">And when the callback is made, this would trigger passing the business case to the next person, with the same request. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.4">When the second one tells the initiator they have finished this part of the job, the whole process can be considered as complete. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.5">If there is a stall at any position, the initiator can request the status of the job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.6">If the request has been lost at some point, it can be sent again. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.7">When one of the executing agents expresses they are done with their unit of work, the initiator may be used to send them another one, which is great to avoid overloading</span><a id="_idTextAnchor443"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.748.1"> the agents and building up buffers, which are bad for performance </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.749.1">at scale.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.751.1">The length </span><a id="_idIndexMarker693"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.1">of this chapter may indicate that I am truly passionate about using processes for software information system integration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.2">To be fully transparent, I have long been against processes as I had been mostly exposed to their bad aspects: constraining people into working in a way that has been decided away from the people actually doing the work, being rigid as a working process tends to block any innovation since “it has always worked this way”, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.3">Following two </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.753.1">Massive Open Online Courses</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.754.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.755.1">MOOCs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.756.1">) from France Université </span><a id="_idIndexMarker694"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.1">Numérique (French Digital University) named CARTOPRO (mapping business processes) and PILOPRO (using business processes to pilot an organization) completely changed my mind by showing me the power of BPM when used correctly, which means the process is designed by the team using it (the BPMN expert is only there to help them with the BPMN standard and ask the right questions) and continuous improvement is at the base of the whole process strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.2">In fact, I went as far as continuing the two MOOCs with an additional digital </span><a id="_idIndexMarker695"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.758.1">diploma from the University Jean Moulin (Lyon 3) in France, for which my thesis work was on Agile method process representation (a challenge, since the very first recommendation in the Agile Manifesto is “people </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.1">over processes”).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.760.1">Why do I tell this personal information? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.760.2">Simply to stress even more the fact that, even if it might surprise you very much, I generally do not recommend using BPMN engines in your architecture of an information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.760.3">I know that may sound weird after all I have said and demonstrated here, and particularly since BPM is part of this ideal information system that I have tried to show how to reach since the beginning of the book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.760.4">But after many attempts at using this approach in production, I can now honestly say that the tools and – more generally – the understanding of BPM are, in most organizations, not developed enough for a true BPM approach to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.761.1">be worthy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.762.1">Hear me well: I am not saying that the approach does not have value at all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.762.2">If you have a given business process that is complex or moving frequently, the investment may be worth it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.762.3">But this is a very particular case when you will have to meet the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.763.1">following criteria:</span></span></p>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.766.1">You know that the tools are not completely stable and you are prepared to change the implementation of a BPMN engine in the middle of the project if needed, considering all costs </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.767.1">and consequences</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.768.1">You have the right expertise for BPM modeling and the maintenance of the BPMN engine, and you are aware that the chances are you will never be able to group this in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.769.1">single person</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.770.1">Management understands that turning the workflow of the team into a process-driven approach will require training for everyone and a process of change management that will be long </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.771.1">and complex</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.772.1">If you check all these boxes, you have a lot of work in front of you but you are in for a treat at the end of this project as, once the investment is done, the returns are phenomenal: modifying the implementation of a process by changing a few files when the strategy </span><a id="_idIndexMarker696"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.773.1">of the company needs to adjust is really the cherry on top of a well-aligned information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.773.2">You will need to go through decoupling, appropriate separation of responsibilities, the long evolution of legacy systems, and all the aforementioned BPM hurdles, but once you get there, the information system will not only be the spine of your organization… it will be its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.774.1">main asset.</span></span></p>
