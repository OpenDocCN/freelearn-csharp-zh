 Chapter 9. Deployment of ASP.NET Core Application</h1>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>Once we have completed the development for our ASP.NET core application, we need to deploy the application so that it can be accessed by our users.</p>&#13;
<p>In any application, irrespective of whether it is the web, desktop, or mobile application, not all the functionalities have been achieved through code. In fact, you should not try to achieve everything through code.</p>&#13;
<p>In this chapter, you are going to learn about the following topics:</p>&#13;
<div class="itemizedlist">&#13;
<ul class="itemizedlist">&#13;
<li class="listitem">Configuration in the ASP.NET Core application</li>&#13;
<li class="listitem">Signing up to the Microsoft Azure platform</li>&#13;
<li class="listitem">Deploying the ASP.NET Core application to the Azure Cloud platform</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>If you have built a web application using any of the previous versions of ASP.NET MVC, there will be a file by the name of <code class="literal">Web.config</code>&#13;
 (an XML file) where you can configure all the dependencies for your application. But in ASP.NET Core, there will be no <code class="literal">Web.config</code>&#13;
 file in your solution:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00131.jpg" alt="Deployment of ASP.NET Core Application"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Instead, we have <code class="literal">project.json</code>&#13;
 (a JSON file), where we will configure the dependencies for your application. Before discussing the contents of <code class="literal">project.json</code>&#13;
 , let us discuss a bit about JSON.</p>&#13;
<p>JSON is an acronym of <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 . It is the open standard data exchange format. It will be in human-readable text and consist of attribute/value pairs. Consider the following JSON, and let's dissect it to see what it represents:</p>&#13;
<pre class="programlisting">{ 
  "addressess": [ 
    { 
      "DoorNo": 16, 
      "Street": "King Street", 
      "areaname": "Mascot" 
    }, 
    { 
      "DoorNo": 12, 
      "Street": "High Street", 
      "areaname": "North Sydney" 
    } 
  ] 
} 
</pre>&#13;
<p>Each piece of data is an attribute value pair, separated by a colon. For example, <code class="literal">"DoorNo": 16</code>&#13;
 tells that the value for <code class="literal">DoorNo</code>&#13;
 variable is 16 in the first record. Each attribute value pair (sometimes called a property) is separated by a comma. For example, consider the following three properties:</p>&#13;
<pre class="programlisting">"DoorNo": 16, 
"Street": "King Street", 
"areaname": "Mascot" 
</pre>&#13;
<p>Each record or object is contained within a pair of curly braces. For example, the following JSON data represents a record or an object:</p>&#13;
<pre class="programlisting">{ 
    "DoorNo": 16, 
    "Street": "King Street", 
    "areaname": "Mascot" 
} 
</pre>&#13;
<p>Similar records can be grouped together and could be formed as an array (of objects). Square brackets are used to represent the array in JSON format as in the following example:</p>&#13;
<pre class="programlisting">"addressess": [ 
  { 
    "DoorNo": 16, 
    "Street": "King Street", 
    "areaname": "Mascot" 
  }, 
  { 
    "DoorNo": 12, 
    "Street": "High Street", 
        "areaname": "North Sydney" 
  } 
] 
</pre>&#13;
<p>If we have to represent the same data in XML format, you can do so as follows. Please note that for each piece of information, we should have a start tag and an end tag (ends with "<code class="literal">/</code>&#13;
 "):</p>&#13;
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;addresses&gt; 
  &lt;address&gt; 
    &lt;DoorNo&gt;16&lt;/DoorNo&gt; 
    &lt;Street&gt;King Street&lt;/Street&gt; 
    &lt;areaname&gt;Mascot&lt;/areaname&gt; 
  &lt;/address&gt; 
 
  &lt;address&gt; 
    &lt;DoorNo&gt;12&lt;/DoorNo&gt; 
    &lt;Street&gt;High Street&lt;/Street&gt; 
    &lt;areaname&gt;North Sydney&lt;/areaname&gt; 
  &lt;/address&gt; 
&lt;/addresses&gt; 
</pre>&#13;
<div class="section" title="The project.json file">&#13;
<div class="titlepage">&#13;
<div>&#13;
<div>&#13;
<h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec60"/>&#13;
 The project.json file</h1>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>All of the project configuration should go into the <code class="literal">project.json</code>&#13;
 file for the ASP.NET Core application. The following is the <code class="literal">project.json</code>&#13;
 file that was created when using the predefined ASP.NET Core web application template:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00132.jpg" alt="The project.json file"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>There are different predefined nodes in this JSON file for different functionalities. Let us take some important nodes in this <code class="literal">project.json</code>&#13;
 file and discuss them.</p>&#13;
<div class="section" title="The dependencies node">&#13;
<div class="titlepage">&#13;
<div>&#13;
<div>&#13;
<h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec56"/>&#13;
 The dependencies node</h2>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>The <code class="literal">dependencies</code>&#13;
 node lists all the dependencies for your ASP.NET Core application.</p>&#13;
<p>The following is a fragment of the <code class="literal">dependencies</code>&#13;
 node in the ASP.NET Core application. Each dependency is an attribute value pair where the attribute represents the dependency and the value represents the version of the dependency. If you need to provide more information for the dependency, you can have a nested JSON configuration as it is in <code class="literal">Microsoft.NETCore.App</code>&#13;
 :</p>&#13;
<pre class="programlisting">"dependencies":{ 
  "Microsoft.NETCore.App":{ 
    "version": "1.0.0-rc2-3002702", 
    "type": "platform" 
    }, 
    "Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore": "1.0.0-rc2-final", 
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies": "1.0.0-rc2- final",</pre>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div class="section" title="The frameworks node">&#13;
<div class="titlepage">&#13;

 The frameworks node</h2>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>In this node, we mention the frameworks that we depend on for the ASP.NET Core application. <code class="literal">dotnet5.6</code>&#13;
 represents the full blown .NET framework and <code class="literal">dnxcore50</code>&#13;
 represents the .NET Core framework containing the subset of functionalities of the complete .NET framework:</p>&#13;
<pre class="programlisting">"frameworks":{ 
  "netcoreapp1.0":{ 
    "imports":[ 
      "dotnet5.6", 
      "dnxcore50",

 Microsoft Azure</h1>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and infrastructure from Microsoft for building, deploying, and managing applications and services. It supports different programming languages and arrays of services.</p>&#13;
<p>You can deploy your application in any server with <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Internet Information Service</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 (<span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>IIS</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 ) in your network. But this restricts your application to being accessed only from within your network, assuming your server could only be accessed from within your network (as in most network setups). In this section, we are going to deploy the ASP.NET Core application in Microsoft Azure so that your users across the globe can access your application.</p>&#13;

 Signing up to Microsoft Azure</h2>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>In order for your application to be deployed to Azure, you need to have an account with Azure. You can create an Azure account for free and you'll have sufficient credits to deploy your application for free within the first 30 days ( <a class="ulink" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/</a>&#13;
 ):</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Signing up to Microsoft Azure"/>&#13;

<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Click the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Try for free</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 button or <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Free Account</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 link in the top right-hand corner and you'll be forwarded to the following page:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Signing up to Microsoft Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Click the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Start now</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 button and you'll be redirected to the following page. Enter your Microsoft account credentials and click the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Sign In</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 button. If you don't have a Microsoft account, you can create one by clicking on the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>sign up now</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 link at the bottom of the page:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Signing up to Microsoft Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>As I have a Microsoft account already, I have signed in with my credentials. Once you have signed-in, you will be asked for details about your country, first name, second name, and your work phone, as follows:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00136.jpg" alt="Signing up to Microsoft Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Once you have entered all the necessary details, you will be asked for your country code and phone number so that Azure can text you or call you to verify you are a real person and not a robot <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Signing up to Microsoft Azure"/>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 . If you choose the option of <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>text me</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 , you will get a code to your mobile phone; you need to enter it in the last field and click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Verify Code</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 :</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Signing up to Microsoft Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Once you have been verified by phone, you need to enter your credit card information in the following form. You'll be billed for approximately $1 and it will be refunded within five to six business days back to your account. This information is collected to identify the user's identity and the user will not be billed unless the user explicitly opted for the paid service:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00138.jpg" alt="Signing up to Microsoft Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Once you enter your credit card information and click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Next</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 , you will have to agree to the subscription agreement as the final step in the sign-up process:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00139.jpg" alt="Signing up to Microsoft Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Once you click the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Sign up</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 button, it will take another five minutes to complete the process. You'll be shown the following screen until the process completes:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Signing up to Microsoft Azure"/>&#13;

 Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure</h1>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>Let's create an ASP.NET Core application that we can deploy in Microsoft Azure:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00145.jpg" alt="Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>The ASP.NET Core application will be created once you click the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>OK</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 button:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00146.jpg" alt="Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>As the default ASP.NET Core Web Application template uses the Entity Framework, we need to execute the following command in order to create the database migration:</p>&#13;
<pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong">
<strong>dotnet ef database update</strong>&#13;

</span>&#13;


</pre>&#13;
<p>Once you enter the command in <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 (in the project's path), the migration file will be created. This migration file will contain all the changes to the database. This migration will be applied at the time of deployment at Azure so that Azure can create the necessary database scripts for Azure deployment:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Once the database migration is completed, right-click on the created Core application and select the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Publish</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 option, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>When you click the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Publish</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 option, you'll be shown the following screen, depicting various publishing options available for you:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Please select the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Microsoft Azure App Service</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 option to publish the web application on the Microsoft Azure platform:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Click on the <span class="strong">&#13;

</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>You can change the web app name to whatever name you would like to have. I have changed the web app name to <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>learningmvc6</strong>&#13;

 .</p>&#13;
<p>Click on the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>New</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 button beside the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Resource Group</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 and enter the name for the resource group. The resource group is just a tag where you can group all of your computing resources so that if you want to delete all the resources, you can just delete the resource group. For example, a resource group could comprise of a web server and a database server—you can think of it like a collection of resources.</p>&#13;
<p>Now, click on the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>New</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 button beside the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>App Service Plan</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 . You will get the following window where you can choose the location and size of your web application container. Your location could be anywhere from South Central US to Europe, from Japan to Canada. Your application container could be anything from free to a machine with 7 GB RAM. I have chosen the free option as our objective is to deploy the ASP.NET Core application in a cloud environment rather than to deploy an application which is to be accessed by millions of users. Of course, you can achieve the same with ASP.NET Core and Microsoft Azure:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00152.jpg" alt="Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Now, we can configure the SQL database which is available as an additional Azure service.</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00153.jpg" alt="Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Click on the + button which is available at the top section which will lead us to the configuration of the SQL database.</p>&#13;

</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>If you have any existing SQL server in the Azure environment, you can use it. As I don't have any such server, I am going to create a SQL server by clicking the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>New</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 button beside SQL Server:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00155.jpg" alt="Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Please enter the administrator user name and password for the SQL Server and click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>OK</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 . You will see the following screen:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00156.jpg" alt="Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Once you click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>OK</strong>&#13;

<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>OK</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 on the preceding screen and we will see the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Create App Service</strong>&#13;

<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Create</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 once we have configured all the required Azure services:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00159.jpg" alt="Deploying the ASP.NET Core application in Azure"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>The preceding screen shows the deployment configuration options, such as the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Site name</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 and <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Destination URL</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 for our application. Click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Next</strong>&#13;

<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>It is important to note that you need to expand the <span class="strong">&#13;

 Deploying the ASP.NET Core web application in the Linux environment</h1>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>In this section of the chapter, we are going to learn how to create and deploy the ASP.NET Core web application in the Linux platform. I am going to deploy the application in the cloud using <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 (<span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>AWS</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 ). Obviously, you don't need AWS to deploy the ASP.NET Core application on Linux. I am just using it so that I do not need to install Linux on my local machine. And another advantage of hosting with AWS (or any other public cloud service provider or any hosting provider) is that I can access the web application from anywhere as it will be publicly available.</p>&#13;
<p>We have the following prerequisites to create and deploy in the Linux environment:</p>&#13;
<div class="itemizedlist">&#13;
<ul class="itemizedlist">&#13;
<li class="listitem">Linux machine</li>&#13;
<li class="listitem">Putty client (if you are using a remote Linux machine)</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div class="section" title="Creating a Linux machine">&#13;

<h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec60"/>&#13;
 Creating a Linux machine</h2>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>We are going to use AWS to create a Linux machine. The advantage of using AWS or any other cloud provider is that we can use their service only when we need it and we can wind down the machine when you are done with it. You only need to pay for the time when you are using it. For the first year, AWS has a free tier where you can host the machine (if it is eligible for the free tier) without having to pay anything. I have been using AWS for more than couple of years to try out many things in the cloud, hence I am not eligible for the free tier.</p>&#13;
<p>However, you can install Linux on your Windows PC by using any virtualization software. Ubuntu Linux has the option of booting up from the USB drive itself so that you don't need to disturb anything in your local PC.</p>&#13;
<p>Once you sign-up for an AWS account, you can go to the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>EC2 dashboard</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 , where you can create <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>EC2 instances</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 :</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00163.jpg" alt="Creating a Linux machine"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Launch Instance</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 in the preceding screen. A wizard will be launched where it will help you in selecting and configuring the instances. In this step, we are selecting the Ubuntu Linux server because of its ease of use.</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00164.jpg" alt="Creating a Linux machine"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>There are different kinds of instances available in AWS ranging from <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>nano</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 (with 0.5 GB RAM) to large machines (with 1952 GB RAM). We are going to choose <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>micro</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 instance as it is eligible for the free tier:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00165.jpg" alt="Creating a Linux machine"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>In previous step, we can configure the instances for the cloud. We can create an auto scale group where the AWS cloud will spin up the instances automatically when the load is high. As our objective is to create and deploy the ASP.NET Core web application, we are going to leave the default values as they are and click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Next: Add Storage</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 to move to the next screen:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00166.jpg" alt="Creating a Linux machine"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>The <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>micro</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 instances do not come with any external storage. Hence, we need to add the storage in order to use it. We have three options for storage to choose from: <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>General Purpose SSD</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 , <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Provisioned SSD</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 , and <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Magnetic SSD</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 . Out of the three, the <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>General Purpose SSD</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 is the storage that would be usually used.</p>&#13;
<p>When your application is making high input-output operations, the throughput may come down. But in the Provisioned SSD you can maintain the required throughput from the storage device. Magnetic storage is just an old type of storage. We are going to use the General Purpose 8 GB <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Solid State Drive</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 (<span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>SSD</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 ) as it serves our purpose well.</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00167.jpg" alt="Creating a Linux machine"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>If you are using multiple instances, you can tag them so that you can control the instances by using the tag name. As we are going to launch only one instance, I am just going to leave it blank and move on to the next step:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00168.jpg" alt="Creating a Linux machine"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>In this step, we can configure the security group for the instance—which ports should be opened for the incoming traffic. The general rule in any configuration is to only open up the ports what you need and nothing else. You also need to tell the IP (or its range) from where the machine could be accessed from. As it is a demo application, we are going to open ports <code class="literal">22</code>&#13;
 , for <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Secure Shell</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 (<span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>SSH</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 ); for using PuTTY, and <code class="literal">80</code>&#13;
 , for accessing the Core web application.</p>&#13;
<p>Once you have configured the Security Groups, click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Review and Launch</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 .</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00169.jpg" alt="Creating a Linux machine"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>On the following screen, you can review the chosen options:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00170.jpg" alt="Creating a Linux machine"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>You can click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Launch</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 once you are fine with the selected options. Otherwise, you can go back to the previous step to reconfigure them with the correct values.</p>&#13;
<p>When you click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Launch</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 , it will ask you to choose a key pair which you will be using to log into any AWS server. If you do not have one, you can create one. As I have created one already, I am going to use the existing one, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00171.jpg" alt="Creating a Linux machine"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Select the key pair and click <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Launch Instances</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 . AWS will spin up new instances for us and the status will be shown (as in the following screenshot). The instance ID will also be available (boxed in the screenshot):</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00172.jpg" alt="Creating a Linux machine"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Clicking on the blue colored link will fetch you the status (as shown in the following screenshot). The <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Public DNS</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 and <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Public IP</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 are important values which you will be using to connect to that server. Hence, I've boxed them in the screenshot:</p>&#13;

</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p>Having created a new Linux server where we can create an ASP.NET 5 web application and host it, we need to install the PuTTY client, a small application that can send commands to the Linux server and receive the responses. As we are going to install the application in a Linux server, we need to have a way for connecting from your Windows PC to the Linux server. The PuTTY client application does exactly that.</p>&#13;
<p>You can download the PuTTY client by visiting <a class="ulink" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>&#13;

<p>Issue the following commands to create a new directory where we will create the ASP.NET 5 application. The first command (<code class="literal">&#13;
<span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>mkdir</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
</code>&#13;
 - make directory) is for creating a directory in Linux and the second command (<code class="literal">&#13;
<span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>cd</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
</code>&#13;
 - change directory) is for going inside the folder. And the last command is the command line to create a .NET Core application:</p>&#13;
<pre class="programlisting">

<p>This will create the .NET Core application, which has a couple of files—<code class="literal">Program.cs</code>&#13;
 and <code class="literal">project.json</code>&#13;
 . It's a bare minimum application that does not have even <code class="literal">Startup</code>&#13;
 file.</p>&#13;
<p>We need to add the <code class="literal">Kestrel HTTP Server</code>&#13;
 package as a dependency in <code class="literal">project.json</code>&#13;
 . You can edit the file by issuing the command <code class="literal">&#13;
<span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>vi project.json</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
</code>&#13;
 . By default, the vi editor will open the file in read-only mode. You need to press <span class="emphasis">&#13;
<em>Esc</em>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 + <span class="emphasis">&#13;
<em>I</em>&#13;

</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Create a new file, <code class="literal">Startup.cs</code>&#13;

<p>Configure the Nginx server by modifying the file (<code class="literal">/etc/nginx/sites-available/default</code>&#13;
 ) to have the following content—so that Nginx will forward the request to ASP.NET. In order to modify this file, you need to have sufficient rights—try switching to a super user. The <code class="literal">&#13;
<span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Sudo su</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
</code>&#13;
 is the command for switching it to a super user. See the following code:</p>&#13;
<pre class="programlisting">server {
  listen 80;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}</pre>&#13;
<p>The code looks like the following:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00191.jpg" alt="Configuring the Nginx server"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Run the application by executing the following command:</p>&#13;
<pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong">
<strong>dotnet run</strong>&#13;

</span>&#13;


</pre>&#13;
<p>You will see the following screen:</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00192.jpg" alt="Configuring the Nginx server"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Now access the application from your browser using the public DNS (AWS created the public DNS when the instance was launched):</p>&#13;
<div class="mediaobject"><img src="Image00193.jpg" alt="Configuring the Nginx server"/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"/>&#13;
<p>Voila! We have created the ASP.NET Core web application and launched it in the Linux box. We have even used the cloud through <span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 (<span class="strong">&#13;
<strong>AWS</strong>&#13;
</span>&#13;
 ).</p>&#13;

<p>In this chapter, you have learned about the different components available in the <code class="literal">project.json</code>&#13;
 file, where all the configuration of your ASP.NET Core goes. We have discussed how to sign up to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform and deploy the ASP.NET Core application in the Azure platform. We have also learned how to create and deploy the ASP.NET Core web application in Linux using Amazon Web Services in the cloud.</p>&#13;
