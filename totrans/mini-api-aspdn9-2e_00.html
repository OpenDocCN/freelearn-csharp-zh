     Preface
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     This book is a comprehensive guide that delves into the world of building streamlined and efficient web services with ASP.NET using
    
    
     
      minimal APIs.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     As the landscape of web development continues to evolve, there is a growing demand for simplicity, speed, and maintainability.
    
    
     I wrote this book to introduce developers—whether experienced or new to the ASP.NET ecosystem—to the power of minimal APIs, an approach that allows for the creation of lightweight and
    
    
     
      performance-oriented applications.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Why
    
    
     
      minimal
     
    
    
     
      APIs?
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     With the release of .NET 6 in 2021, Microsoft introduced minimal APIs as a new way to define HTTP APIs with less ceremony and boilerplate code.
    
    
     Minimal APIs focus on reducing the overhead traditionally associated with larger frameworks such as ASP.NET MVC, while still maintaining the robustness of the .NET platform.
    
    
     By stripping away unnecessary complexity, minimal APIs empower developers to rapidly prototype, iterate, and deploy applications that scale with
    
    
     
      their needs.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In this book, I will walk you through the essentials of minimal APIs, from basic routing and endpoint structure to advanced features such as dependency injection, authentication, and
    
    
     
      middleware integration.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     I’ll also introduce you to some core design principles, providing an overview of some best practices designed to keep your minimal APIs maintainable, secure, and scalable
    
    
     
      over time.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Each chapter is structured to provide hands-on examples, ensuring that by the end, you’ll not only understand how to use minimal APIs but also why they matter in modern
    
    
     
      software development.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     At the time of writing, .NET 9 had reached its first release candidate phase (RC1), and .NET 9 was very close to general availability.
    
    
     I’ve included information throughout the book on new minimal API features in .
    
    
     
      NET 9.

     Who this book is for
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     The book is intended to serve as an introduction to Minimal APIs, allowing developers with a basic understanding of C# and
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      object-oriented programming
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      OOP
     
    </strong>
    
     ) to explore the main concepts and begin their Minimal API
    
    
     
      development journey.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Whether you are an experienced ASP.NET developer looking to leverage new tools or a newcomer seeking to understand web development, this book will guide you step by step.
    
    
     It’s ideal for developers seeking to build microservices, start-ups prototyping new ideas, or even established enterprises looking for a more efficient way to handle specific
    
    
     
      API needs.
