- en: The Unity Editor is a powerful, general purpose game development tool. Nevertheless,
    there are times during development when you probably wished the editor offered
    a specific feature that it doesn't have or behaved in a particular way, simply
    because it would be more convenient for you and your specific game. Maybe you'd
    like the path editing features, batch renaming functionality, or mesh creation
    tools, among others. In such cases, you can search the Asset Store for add-ons
    that meet your needs. But even then, you may still not find what you need. Consequently,
    the focus then turns to how the editor can be adapted or customized to achieve
    your purpose. Thankfully, there are many ways Unity can be changed as a tool,
    and this chapter focuses on particular case studies. First, it explores how to
    create a **Batch Rename** tool for renaming multiple selected objects in one operation.
    Second, it covers how to create a color range field in the Object Inspector to
    blend between two colors using a slider. Third, it explores how to expose public
    C# properties in the Object Inspector for both setting and getting values. Lastly,
    it covers how to use C# attributes to create a localization toolkit that allows
    you to automatically change all in-game strings to a chosen language (English,
    French, and so on) at the touch of a button.

    instances, you'll typically use the duplicate feature to clone objects (*Ctrl*
    + *D*). This leads to many objects sharing the same name. Now, while there's nothing
    technically wrong in name duplication per se, it's both inconvenient and untidy.
    It results in a hierarchy panel of many identically named objects, and it's practically
    impossible to distinguish between specific objects by their name alone. Furthermore,
    object searches in script using the `GameObject.Find` function cannot be relied
    on to retrieve the specific object that you need, since it could return any one
    of the identically named objects. The solution, then, is to name each object uniquely
    and appropriately. But doing this can be tedious, especially if you're working
    with many objects. Thus, there's a need for a Batch Rename tool.

    main menu. Their purpose is to present a set of options from which the user can
    choose before pressing a confirmation button that performs a one-time process.

    automated, one-time operations on single or multiple objects.

    work like tags. Programmers can attach an attribute to a class, variable, or a
    method to associate data with it, which is known to the compiler. The attribute
    itself is entirely descriptive because it does nothing; it''s simply data. The
    importance of attributes arises because all the code based on .NET (or Mono) has
    the ability to step outside itself and become self-conscious, that is, the ability
    to look at all the classes and data types and instances contained inside the program.
    For each object in the program, its metadata (attributes) can be queried and examined.
    This ability of a program to "look at itself from the outside" is known as reflection
    as it''s like looking in a mirror. Of course, the program does not see itself
    in reverse or in distorted terms but rather as it truly is, including all its
    metadata. To give a quick example of reflection, try out the following code sample
    8-2\. This code will cycle through all the custom-made classes in your Unity application
    across all source files. Notice it doesn''t just list all the instances of classes
    in the scene but all classes themselves (that is, the blueprints, metaphorically

    influence how the objects should be handled. This is powerful for editor plugins
    because by creating our own custom-defined attributes that can be attached to
    data types and member variables, we can integrate our code with the Unity Editor
    without making its logical or runtime structure invalid. That is, we can tag variables
    in code with attributes to customize how they appear in the Unity Editor without
    invalidating or affecting it in terms of its logic or structure at runtime. Next,
    we'll see how to create custom attributes to customize the editor.

    variables, by way of their declarations, to limit the accepted values for them

    control is substituted for an editable field that controls the accepted values
    for the variable. This does not, of course, affect the values assigned to the
    same variables in the code. In the code, at runtime, the `Range` attribute has
    no effect itself. Rather, the `Range` attribute simply controls how numerical
    public variables are presented in the Object Inspector, and how they are entered
    there via user input. Behind the scenes, an `Editor` class is querying object
    `Attribute` data through reflection to control how the data type is rendered in

    fade-in and fade-out effects for scene transitions. This is known as Color Lerping

    development is localization. This refers to the broad range of technical, economic,
    and logistical measures a developer takes to support multiple natural languages
    in their game, such as English, French, German, Spanish, Esperanto, and so on.
    The technical aim is not so much to support this or that specific language, but
    rather to establish an infrastructure that could support any arbitrary language
    chosen at any time, now or later. The entire scope and role of localization in
    development is beyond the scope of this book, but here we''ll examine one way
    in which the Unity Editor can be customized to facilitate a quick and easy localization
    workflow. For example, consider the following sample XML file, in which game text
    for the buttons in a main menu system is defined in both English and a "spoof
    language" called Yoda:'

    a sample user interface menu. Each text element is assigned a unique ID: `text_01`,
    `text_02`, `text_03`, and `text_04`. These IDs uniquely identify each item of
    text in the game and will match across all specified languages. The purpose here
    is to import the text file into Unity that allows the developer to switch between
    languages at the touch of a button, and have all relevant text elements in the
    game change automatically to accommodate the language switch. Let''s see how this
    works.'

    a seamless transition between languages. The ID is the one common denominator
    that makes an automated localization possible. To implement the localization system
    in code, we''ll first create an attribute that should be applied to all localized

    and its practical use for creating `Editor` classes that extended the editor behavior
    beyond its defaults to accommodate custom intentions. The ability to do this is
    not always essential to building Unity games themselves but it can make your work
    easier. Furthermore, it can lead to making money via the Asset Store, should you
    wish to develop custom add-ons that can help other developers. Here, you saw how
    to create a Batch Rename tool with the `ScriptableWizard` class and then a color
    blending property for the Object Inspector. Next, we made extensive use of reflection
    to expose all public C# properties in the Object Inspector that allowed us direct
    access to the set and get property values as if we'd accessed them at runtime.
    Further, we moved on to see how a localization framework could be implemented
    from XML files via the `Editor` classes that allow string variables to be automatically
    changed to match a selected language. For more information, you can visit [http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/editor/custom-data/](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/editor/custom-data/)
    and [http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/editor/custom-list/](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/editor/custom-list/).
    In the next chapter, we'll move our conceptual and technical baggage to explore
    the world of 2D from more unconventional angles.
