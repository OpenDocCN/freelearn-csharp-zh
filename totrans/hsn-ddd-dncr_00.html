<p class="mce-root">This book will help you solve complex business problems by understanding users better, finding the right problem to solve, and building lean, event-driven systems to give your customers what they really want. You will be taken through the fundamentals of <strong>Domain-Driven Design</strong> (<strong>DDD</strong>) principles and how it can be applied using modern tools such as EventStorming, Event Sourcing, and CQRS. Through this book, you will learn how DDD applies directly to various architectural styles, such as REST, reactive systems, and microservices. You will empower teams to work flexibly with improved services and decoupled interactions.</p>

<p>This book is for .NET developers who have an intermediate level understanding of C#, and for those who seek to deliver value, not just write code. An intermediate level of competence in JavaScript will be helpful for the UI chapters.</p>

<p><a href="948b7834-c47c-4321-a91c-2ba58068c52e.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Why Domain-Driven Design?</em><span>, covers the concepts of problem and solution spaces, requirements specifications, complexity, knowledge, and ignorance. These topics have a significant impact on how and what we deliver.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="6fa9e02b-66fa-4e1d-a69c-f26726dc9ad0.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Language and Context</em>, deep dives into the importance of language and explains Ubiquitous Language.<span><br/></span></p>
<p><a href="07ee37fb-0189-467c-865d-18e72868b137.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <span><em>EventStorming</em>, explores one of the most popular techniques for domain modeling and goes through some practical tips on how to organize useful workshops between domain experts and developers.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="bea6a7db-f270-4c0b-a3c3-bedb4182cafb.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <span><em>Designing the Model</em>, goes deeper into the modeling process, with more of a focus on artifacts that can help us to start writing code and deliver initial prototypes as soon as possible.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="034423e8-8080-4073-bd08-b98a129384a4.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <span><em>Implementing the Model</em>, forms the basis for our domain model implemented in code. We will go through different styles of performing the behavior in domain entities and also write some tests.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><a href="b80c3e00-e28b-4c13-a3ec-04edd2327a74.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Acting with Commands</em><span>, shows how to implement commands, and how commands are the glue between our domain model and the world outside it. We will learn how to make our model useful by letting people interact with it.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="1c04605e-ffe3-49fb-94c6-2bb6e4fe269d.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <span><em>Consistency Boundary</em>, takes a closer look at entity persistence, and its scope will be our focus. We will learn what types of consistency we need to deal with and how important it is to understand consistency boundaries.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="4eea9289-d77e-4568-a9c0-c5e1265e3b4e.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Aggregate Persistence</em><span>, takes a deep dive into the topic of aggregate persistence. We will find a way to store our domain objects in a database and see our application working for the first time.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="6f50ee65-024a-4c46-89c8-343183b05b8f.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>CQRS - The Read Side</em><span>,</span> covers the read side of CQRS and explains what the read models are. You will learn how to use Ubiquitous Language for queries and see how to implement CQRS with one database.</p>
<p><a href="75bc64ae-a642-42b2-a44a-05ae0cb2b750.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Event Sourcing</em><span>, shows how events can be used to persist the state of an object, instead of using traditional persistence mechanisms. We will cover the concept of event streams and see how streams relate to aggregates. We will use the Event Store to persist our aggregates in streams and load them back.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="c4156d9d-9130-4225-b205-ef76cb4bcca3.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Projections and Queries</em><span>, takes you through the challenges of querying the Event Sourced system and solving these challenges by using separate read models and projections.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="01e2a3de-465b-48aa-b297-e75269799cbb.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Bounded Context</em>, makes you familiar with the concept of Bounded Contexts. We will identify contexts in our project and separate the system into pieces. We will also learn about the Context Map, which shows the landscape of Bounded Contexts for the entire system and their relationships.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/Splitting_the_System.pdf">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Splitting the System</em><span>, gives practical advice about identifying Bounded Contexts and implementing more than one context in the sample application. This chapter is available as an online chapter at: <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/Splitting_the_System.pdf">https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/Splitting_the_System.pdf</a>.</span><span> </span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>html, body, #map {<br/> height: 100%; <br/> margin: 0;<br/> padding: 0<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>[default]<br/>exten =&gt; s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)<br/>exten =&gt; s,2,Voicemail(u100)<br/><strong>exten =&gt; s,102,Voicemail(b100)</strong><br/>exten =&gt; i,1,Voicemail(s0)</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ mkdir css</strong><br/><strong>$ cd css</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
