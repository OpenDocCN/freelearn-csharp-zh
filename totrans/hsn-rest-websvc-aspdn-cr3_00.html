<p>.NET Core is a <span>breath of fresh air for all the consumers of the Microsoft ecosystem. The old ASP.NET and .NET framework both have a long history. Over the years, the growth of the .NET framework and the long-time support constraints have resulted in odd implementations and hard-to-maintain web applications and web services.</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, the strong dependency between .NET framework and the Windows OS has led to substantial limitations in the cloud technology world. </span></p>
<p>.NET Core and ASP.NET Core are designed to evolve. They use abstract software development practices including open source, community-oriented approaches, as well as continuous improvement concepts. Today, ASP.NET Core is more flexible, fast, and powerful than ever. All the constraints developers had faced with .NET framework have been expelled and rewritten from scratch. Consequently, it is now possible to run .NET Core on every platform with no limitations. The framework is directly shipped with the <span>.NET Core</span> application. Therefore, it is possible to run it using a containerization approach. The documentation, the issues, and the roadmap are all available on GitHub.  Microsoft is now following, by default, an open source way of working. </p>
<p>I've been interested in .NET Core since the first release of the old DNX runtime. This book will introduce you to the power of ASP.NET Core and how to use its strength and flexibility to run web services. Furthermore, the book aims to fight the prejudices that people have regarding the .NET ecosystem and seeks to increase the adoption of .NET Core.</p>

<p>This book<span> assumes that you have some knowledge of C# (or a similar object-oriented programming language, such as Java) and that you have some experience in building web applications.</span></p>
<p>This book doesn't require any specific tools, but you will need .NET Core installed on your machine (<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download</a>). I strongly suggest that you have at least one code editor, such as Visual Studio Code, possibly with OmniSharp, or an <strong>integrated development environment</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>) such as Visual Studio (on Windows or Mac), or Rider IDE (on Windows, Mac, or Linux).</p>
<p>I've written all the examples on macOS X using Rider IDE and Bash.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "The headers part tells the client that the response should be processed using a specific <kbd>content-type</kbd>; in this case, <kbd>application/json</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre><span>&lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"&gt;<br/>  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;<br/>    &lt;OutputType&gt;Exe&lt;/OutputType&gt;<br/></span>    &lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;netcoreapp3.0;net461&lt;/TargetFrameworks&gt;<span><br/>  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;<br/>&lt;/Project&gt;<br/> </span></pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><span>&lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"&gt;<br/>  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;<br/>    &lt;OutputType&gt;Exe&lt;/OutputType&gt;<br/><strong>    &lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;netcoreapp3.0;net461&lt;/TargetFrameworks&gt;</strong><br/>  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;<br/>&lt;/Project&gt;<br/> </span></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>dotnet build</strong><br/><strong>dotnet run</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "As you can see, it is running <strong>Hello, World!</strong></span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
