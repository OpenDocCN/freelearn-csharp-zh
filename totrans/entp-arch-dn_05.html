<h1 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>A Utopic Perfect IT System</h1>
<p>Remember the joke in <a href="B21293_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a> about the perfect information system being formed by a computer, a human, and a dog? There was some truth in this because humans change all the time (their minds, their way of doing, the rules they follow in business, what they want to buy, and so on), while computers are happy with repeating, stable, well-defined tasks. Of course, the two do not mix well, hence the presence of the dog to prevent the human from making a mess of the computer work.</p>
<p>But who created the computer first? Human, of course. So, the joke was not about the fact that humans should not touch computers at all, but rather create them and then let them do the work without changing anything afterward. Of course, this would only be possible if the first attempt was, through some kind of a miracle, perfect.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of an ideal system</li>
<li>Data management in the ideal system</li>
<li>Rules management in the ideal system</li>
<li>Processes management in the ideal system</li>
<li>How close can we get to this utopic system?</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter will describe what would resemble this 100% ideal information system, with an ability to adapt to the ever-changing business changes and still perform in terms of speed and robustness, as well as energy efficiency. Such a system was imagined by Dominique Vauquier in his fundamental book <em class="italic">Le système d’information durable - la refonte du SI avec SOA</em>. The three main entities constituting the ideal information system are <strong class="bold">master data management</strong> (<strong class="bold">MDM</strong>), <strong class="bold">business rules management system</strong> (<strong class="bold">BRMS</strong>), and <strong class="bold">business process modeling</strong> (we are going to explain these in more detail shortly). The next few sections will explain them one by one, and this chapter will end with an analysis of how this utopic system could be created in reality and what would prevent this.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>The concept of an ideal IT system</h1>
<p>Before we detail the<a id="_idIndexMarker270"/> different parts of such an ideal system, I will explain a bit more about the usefulness of such a model. When things are a bit clearer about the goal we want to reach, we will detail the different parts of the concept and try to make them more concrete.<a id="_idTextAnchor167"/></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/>The use for an ideal structure</h2>
<p>“Ideal” or “utopic” are<a id="_idIndexMarker271"/> terms that engineers generally have a strange relationship with. Though much of their thinking is done inside hypothetical contexts to make an advance in theory, they know that practice will always be quite a long shot from the theory and, depending on how they are versed between theory and practice, engineers can easily fall into many traps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staying purely in theory risks that their thinking is never applied in the real world, which ends up in a loss of time and also an impossibility of truly knowing the value of their work.</li>
<li>Not having enough theoretical background to make advances in their field; remaining purely in the practice of the job might help refine some areas but seldom bring strong, domain-changing, revolutionary ideas.</li>
<li>The worst of all: switching between the two but never making real links between them that enrich the practice from the theory and confirm the theory from the practice. This capacity of bringing the two together is, in my opinion, what makes the best engineering structures, may they be companies or even countries that teach and organize this capacity at the highest level.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why there is a place in such a book, otherwise extremely turned toward practices with lots of returns on experience from many real-world information systems, for a bit of theory and ideal thinking<a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>The origin of the design</h2>
<p>The structure of an<a id="_idIndexMarker272"/> ideal system, as we are going to describe here, was first coined in a <em class="italic">Le système d’information durable - la refonte du SI avec SOA</em>, by Dominique Vauquier, one of the best-known enterprise architects in France, and proponent of the PRAXEME method. I was lucky enough to receive training more than 10 years ago and its explanations were so clear that I immediately bought his books, which quickly became some of my references for my consulting work in information system industrialization.</p>
<p>The principles<a id="_idIndexMarker273"/> behind this idea were that, knowing lots of information systems, it was possible to describe a kind of meta-system that would encompass all the necessary features with only a few generic modules that could be customized to implement the business-related aspects. Each of these three modules would be extremely general and not related at all to any particular business, which explains why there is so little in the whole system. These three areas are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing data and making it available (roughly speaking, this is what gets done by databases)</li>
<li>Executing business rules to make decisions (this would be where software applications consuming the data come into the game)</li>
<li>Implementing complex processes by orchestrating many small tasks (though very approximative, this is what making applications work together is about)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dominique Vauquier was indeed able to point to any business feature as a composition of these three different technical functions. After working with many industrial information systems in small and large companies, he considered that the three modules together would be able to handle every imaginable feature of any given business domain. Though this is not a structure that has been largely used for now, it may be just a very anticipated glimpse at what would become industrialized and well-controlled information systems a few decades from now. At least, this is – from my humble point of view – the best candidate for such a structure with so much ahead-thinki<a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>ng.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Using a vision to define a target</h2>
<p>Why<a id="_idIndexMarker274"/> should we talk about an architecture that is so futuristic and that we do not have any proof of its capability to be applied in practice? Can this lead to overthinking or over-engineering? If you ask yourself these questions, you are very right to do so, and this chapter is not about pushing you to use this tool for your next information system architecture.</p>
<p>Just like any pattern or architecture tool, it is principally there to give you some ideas and, if some parts of it are fit for your system, it will be great that it helps you go forward and accelerate your thinking.</p>
<p>But having<a id="_idIndexMarker275"/> an “ideal” or “utopic” vision can also be helpful to give a global orientation to your realization. Remember the metaphor of Agile development, where we do not shoot an arrow but walk with it toward the target and plant the arrow with our hands when the target is reached? Well, to do so, we agreed that we need to know what the target is like to find and reach it. And sometimes, the target shape can be hard to imagine. Sure, a business-oriented mind will give you the best idea and you should remain functionally-focused. But what happens if the business ideas are quite blurry? Maybe a “soft,” adaptable information system would allow you to start working while things get a little clearer. Starting building the system will even help the business owners think better about what they want. And if you have an “ideal” system that can very quickly adapt to their minds constructing the business idea, it may be the kind of system you need for such a project.</p>
<p>Of course, there will be an extra cost of being completely generic (in performance but also time for initial setup), but if this is the kind of situation you are in, the capacity to adapt to a moving business target by simply customizing parameters of the information system may largely overcome these drawbacks. And nothing prevents you, once the business vision is settled, from re-implementing some now-stable parts with specific, optimized bits of code, where needed.</p>
<p>Now that the vision is clear, we are going to dive deeper into the three parts that constitute this ideal IT system, namely the data management module, the rules management module, and, finally, the process management mo<a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>dule.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Data management in the ideal system</h1>
<p><strong class="bold">MDM</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>the very first <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>part of the ideal system. Before talking<a id="_idIndexMarker278"/> about how the data is processed and used, it is logical to explain what form the data will take and how it will be managed. This is why we will explain the concept of MDM in a utopic system before discussing BRMS <a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>and BPM.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Data is the blood of information systems</h2>
<p>Data is the <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>most important component of any information system. Some people may even think they are purely about data since the very term “data” has been so hyped in the past decade.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it is hard to imagine an information system without at least one database to store the data, since it would mean there is no knowledge of any business event that stays there. It is possible to imagine some pieces of information that are completely transient and not stored, but a whole system made of such particular cases sounds impossible to fathom.</p>
<p>This means that data should be taken care of first and foremost, and this is what the first module of the ideal generic information system is about. The feature is called MDM. The term <em class="italic">master</em>, in this case, refers to the most important data in a system, those used by most of the participants in the system. But in this particular case of a utopic system, every single piece of data would be considered as such and placed in a single module that deals with this responsibility <a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>of “MDM.”</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Data as the 21st-century oil – really?</h2>
<p>Before we dive<a id="_idIndexMarker280"/> a bit more into what would be such a module, a small additional note on the importance of data: you may heard the expression “oil of the 21st century” regarding data. This is to stress the point that data has become such an important part of commercial organizations nowadays that it can be compared to oil, which has brought a huge part of the industry improvements in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Data is used by many industrial companies to follow their machines, optimize production, and relate it to selling and stocks, in short virtualizing the industrial process in a “digital twin” to better control it. But for some industries, data may even be the raw material itself, and lots of digital-native companies nowadays make their money purely out of data collection, refining, and reselling, particularly for advertisement activities.</p>
<p>Oil exploitation, which has happened since the 20th century, has allowed industrial production to be accelerated dramatically in almost every domain (heavy industries, trains, fertilizers, agriculture machinery, and so on) but also brought to life many of the biggest companies to exploit and produce oil itself. This comparison is fair, although care should be taken in keeping a few important differences in mind.</p>
<p>First, the equivalent of the oil-cracking refinery column has not been invented yet for data, or at least not in its standard form. Sure, some business intelligence tools and big data <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>approaches can help in some cases, but the rate of failure of data projects (estimated between 70 and 80%, depending on the studies) shows that we are still far from industrialization in oil-refinery plants. To this day, data remains partly, for most companies, such as oil, was for land owners at the end of the 19th century: pollution. Sure, there is value in it, but it is completely out of exploitation, and there is no standard way of extracting this value.</p>
<p>Let’s also not forget that data remains based on actual oil: data centers consume a huge amount of energy (soon, 8% of the energy on the planet will be taken for digital uses, which is more than air travel and will soon reach car transportation). And though some data center owners pretend to use renewable energies (but just buy compensating activities, which does not reduce global oil consumption), most of them are still heavily dependent on oil for energy. In addition, the production of servers and network hardware, the transportation used for them, and the exploitation functions are large consumers of energy and, eventually, oil.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very important to keep in mind that data may indeed become the oil of the next century, but we are in this situation at the moment. The data management approach described in this chapter may help you reach it, particularly by using governance to improve data quality, which remains the number-one cause hindering data ex<a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>ploitation.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>A really “know it all” system</h2>
<p>I will not go into too<a id="_idIndexMarker282"/> much detail in this chapter since MDM is the subject of a dedicated chapter later in this book, and it will be explained together with a real example, which will hopefully make everything easier. For<a id="_idIndexMarker283"/> now, I will just propose a comparison of the MDM with a “know-it-all all” system. Indeed, a well-made MDM will not only know the state of entities at present but will know the whole story of each entity and remember their different states and modifications, from cradle (creation) to grave (archiving or deletion). Due to this, <strong class="bold">persistence</strong> is the main responsibility of an MDM module.</p>
<p>However, there are some other responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Ease of research</strong>: This goes with persistence because keeping data without making it available afterward would not make much sense. This particular responsibility might be delegated in its implementation, typically when the MDM application uses an indexation engine, for example (full-text search is a complicated matter that justifies cutting a responsibility into several more atomic ones and trusting dedicated modules with each).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Origin of reporting /business intelligence</strong>: Just like data search, reporting is an important responsibility that MDM modules can trust other implementations with, for example, a data lake.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Ability to handle multiple versions of entities</strong>: As explained previously, a true MDM should know <strong class="bold">every</strong> version of a data entity, not only its “latest” state (the quotes are there to stress the point that this “latest” concept is something of a pain in lots of systems, particularly when they are distributed, because it depends on the consistency of data, and thus transactions, optimistic/pessimistic locks, and so on).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Capacity to manage validation for attribute values</strong>: Though this might be a shared responsibility with the BRMS, which we will discuss later in this chapter, a <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>small amount of validation can be done by the MDM itself to ensure its basic consistency. This should not be confused with data correctness, which depends on its purpose (a single piece of data can be fit for business use but not for another one) and can vary well in time, depending on the data versions but also the changes of business rules.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Business rules</strong>: Some entry-level business rules, which only use data that is present inside the MDM system, can also be added to the MDM, though most of them are concerned with validation, as stated previously.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Handling of history</strong>: Alongside storing successive versions of data, the MDM has to be able to make it possible to easily retrieve these versions depending on the time targeted, browse through the history, find who has made which type of change on the data, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this doesn’t seem clear, don’t worry – the example provided later in this book of an MDM storing a person’s data will help you understand how all these responsibilities are used an<a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>d implemented.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Relationship with CQRS</h2>
<p>If you are into data <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>architecture, the separation of concerns between storing versioned modifications of the data and <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>searching the different states of it might have been identified by you as the principle of <strong class="bold">command and query responsibility segregation</strong> (<strong class="bold">CQRS</strong>). We are indeed talking about the same principles, even if CQRS goes way further than just separating the two responsibilities and proposes a technical approach on how to make them work together.</p>
<p>CQRS is too big of a subject for it to be treated in this book together with all the other subjects we have to explain, but it perfectly fits the separation of responsibilities of an MDM module, and I strongly encourage you to use this approach when creating MDM implementations. The example we’ll cover in the next few parts of this book will use a CQRS approach, though in a very limited and simplified implementation. Again, this is an edition choice as adding a full Kafka engine would have made it difficult to concentrate on the application itself and would get us too far from the subje<a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>ct of this book.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>The need for data quality</h2>
<p>Coming<a id="_idIndexMarker287"/> back to the oil metaphor, having sand in it is a real problem because oil has to be purified enough to enter the plant. Otherwise, not only the quality of the output products would not be as good, but this could also damage this extremely expensive piece of industrial equipment that the refinery column is in. This is why sweet crude oil is one of the best types of oil, and also the reason why gas coming from bituminous sands is so costly to refine (in addition to a catastrophe for our environment).</p>
<p>In IT, there is a strong equivalence to data as clean data is a great product that will allow precise reporting on the business activity, quick insights on problems that may appear, and overall better control of the company. Discuss this with anybody in the industry and everyone will agree that the quality of data is of paramount importance… Yet, it is estimated that more than half of the job of a data scientist is to clean data. I have seen several companies where this proportion dangerously increases to around 80%. I say “dangerously” for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, paying a high-salary profile to realize such low-intelligence tasks is a waste of money</li>
<li>It is also generally a waste of time as good data scientists will generally leave the job in the next 6 months if they have to work more on cleaning and assembling the data than “making it talk”</li>
<li>Finally, it shows a problem up the pipe because the IT system that sends this dirty data has not been correctly designed, which means that there are good chances that these reporting issues are not the only ones</li>
</ul>
<p>How<a id="_idIndexMarker288"/> come everybody agrees that data cleanliness is important but the situation remains so awful? Well, it just so happens that data management is generally not about the technical part (which is quite easy, with the number of tools we have nowadays) but about the organizational part: who is responsible for which data? Who has the right to collect it and update it? Which group decides on how data is cut and which data goes into this or this service responsibility? All these subjects are a part of what is<a id="_idIndexMarker289"/> called <strong class="bold">data governance</strong>, which, despite its huge importance, is mostly not dealt with by many companies, though they have all the technical tools to store data. Again, this is the same root cause as usual: technology has never solved an organizational problem, but editors are so good at making you believe this… and, as a company owner, you want so much for it to be true! But no, you will have to do the uninteresting job of data classification, finding data owners and data stewards, implementing regular meetings to follow up on the decided data processes, and more. Creating your MDM module now is precisely the right time to do so as its success heavily depend<a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>s on these actions.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Designing a generic “referential”</h2>
<p>There will <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>almost always be an internal designation of the software application that stores the main entities of an organization, for example, products. Most of the time, people will call this by the name of the technology – for example, the “products database” or the “products Excel file” – but this is a bad habit as it couples the functional concept with a technical, software, concept. Not only can these two evolve separately (and the “products file” becomes the “products database”) but they should be able to do so as much as possible, and thus be kept separate.</p>
<p>The “products list” is already a bit better from this point of view, but my favorite (because it is very close to an equivalent word in French, which is my native language) is to call this a product “referential.” This name bears the important notion of it assuming a status of reference for<a id="_idIndexMarker291"/> the data contained within while being also possible to see it as a referential in space, which comes back to the idea of a map of the information system, just like we would have a geographical map, with coordinates inside a referential.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">The naming could be much worse, as I already cited anecdotally in <a href="B21293_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor069"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, with one of my customers calling the article’s referential simply “Serge’s file.” This led to a lot of confusion as it was hiding the uttermost importance of keeping this file up-to-date, which was not even Serge’s job officially!</p>
<p>Most of the time, so-called “referentials” are dedicated to a single type of entity (products, sales, customers, and so on) The idea of the utopic system described in this chapter is to have a single piece of software for any type of entity. We won’t dive too deep into the utopia in the rest of this book and will maintain a more standard approach with one implementation of referential for a given business domain. This also allows us to adopt the best technology for each case (the “best of bread” approach), rather than a “one size fits all” approach, which is interesting in theory but extremely complex to make wo<a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>rk in the real world.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Choices of implementation for an MDM</h2>
<p>Love it or hate it, Excel <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>remains the simplest MDM you can have, and in many small companies, a well-organized process using Excel can already go a long way, provided you have removed the most important shortcomings of a good organization (a centralized file shared with rights for different users rather than copies everywhere, strict organization of data quality, and so on).</p>
<p>Of course, there will be a level of complexity that will necessitate a dedicated implementation. That sounds crazy, but there are very few software applications dedicated to MDM. There is an offer from Microsoft based on SQL Server called Master Data Services, but its use sounds very limited, at least in my area of knowledge. Following a discussion with Microsoft, the product is indeed abandoned, and the successor is a partner product <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>called <strong class="bold">Profisee</strong> working together <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>with <strong class="bold">Microsoft Purview</strong> to provide data governance functions (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/profisee-master-data-management-purview">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/profisee-master-data-management-purview</a>). Semarchy (<a href="https://www.semarchy.com">https://www.semarchy.com</a>) sounds like a new and interesting approach to integrated MDM but I have not given it a sufficient try to recommend it yet.</p>
<p>I have seen some companies using headless CMS systems such as Strapi, Sanity, Cockpit, Prisma, and others to create backends that can serve as entry-level MDM. But this generally lacks a good data versioning system and implementation of governance remains the job of the integrator. All in all, this is a very technology-based approach and, as stated previously, an MDM is much more than simply storing data.</p>
<p>This is roughly<a id="_idIndexMarker295"/> it for an off-the-shelf approach, and admittedly this does not go a long way. Every correct implementation of an MDM I have seen to this day has been a dedicated development. Some business applications, such as ERP, sometimes have a good referential for products or customers, but most of them miss the alignment on business.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">It may sound logical that an ERP may not be business-aligned as it tries to be generic to many business domains. Nonetheless, when you see a top five ERP system proposing two separate domains for customers and suppliers, ignoring the possible duplication of data for most of the existing companies, this shows that the problem is not only the variety of businesses, but the very approach of these ERP companies, which consider that modeling the business is 100% the customer’s responsibility, whereas it should be a shared responsibility based on written, forward-compatible, standards. But this would go against vendor lock-in, which is not in their interest, and this is why the only way forward is for the customers to choose an implementation that accepts standards for business entity representations, including developing these standards in the (rare) cases where they do not exist.</p>
<p>What remains – and represents the vast majority of running MDM systems – are dedicated applications coupled with a database (and sometimes an indexation engine, and even a data lake, as explained previously). They are custom-developed for a given business use by internal IT or external software companies. This is a huge waste of time and money if you think globally as many companies have needs that are extremely close to each other. However, this is just how it is for now due to the lack of business standards used in the software industry.</p>
<p>Now for the second part of the ideal system: after talking about data, we need t<a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>o discuss business rules.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Rules management in the ideal system</h1>
<p>Business<a id="_idIndexMarker296"/> rules are <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>predicates that apply to data to help implement real-world decisions made that are necessary for the business. For example, you may state that a customer cannot be sent a product so long as they have not checked their bank coordinates. This is a business rule as it can be expressed without any signs of software implementation: this could be done manually by someone in the plant checking with accounting via phone that the rule has been respected via p before sending t<a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>he package to the customer.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Rules as the nervous network of the information system</h2>
<p>If data <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>is the blood of the information system, business rules are its nervous and muscular networks: they use the blood to realize some activities in a given way. A business rule in our metaphor could be that “if you feel a burning sensation on your finger, the arm must retract.” This rule is implemented in our spinal reflex system, which uses the sensors in its fingers to send the information/data through the nerves, resulting in the muscles from the concerned arm being unable to be controlled.</p>
<p>In IT, the implementation of business rules is mostly what are called applications. This is generally where business rules are contained. In our example, there must be some code somewhere in the ERP that alerts the package preparation system that the customer has not passed the condition of having a verified way of payment. The reaction of the packaging system may be that this order will not be processed, or maybe that it will be processed in advance but the resulting physical package will be retained before delivery. The actual implementation is the responsibility of each module, but the business rule remains the same: “No customer delivered with their orders so long as we have not verified we can get paid,”</p>
<p>Business <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>rules also contain all the calculations, from the most complex to the most mundane, that you will perform in the information system. Let me go back on this because there is something to say about the right separation of responsibility: <strong class="bold">no client (GUI or application calling an API) should deal with business rules, which always have to be implemented server-side</strong>. This is certainly something that you know about and sounds logical: after all, it is obvious that such important bits of functional reasoning must be centralized to ensure that they are applied everywhere the same way. But look at any client for a few minutes and you will find loads of functional decisions that are made locally, sometimes with the best reasoning. For example, think about calculating a net amount from the gross amount and the VAT rate. Sure, the VAT rate does not change very often in an application’s lifetime, and the way the calculation is made is itself very stable, so there should not be any big issue with trusting the client to do this computing, and we are getting better performance since we avoid a roundtrip to a server.</p>
<p>Alright, but you can always imagine ways that the business rule is going to change. As already imagined, the VAT rate can change. Also, if we are talking about net amount calculation for a multi-line order, you must handle multiple VAT rates in a single entity. The question boils down to risk management: if you know that you will never hit these particular cases, that’s alright. If you doubt the possibility they will appear in the future, you should first ask your product owners about it. If they are not sure about it, you will have to compare the costs of different approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can hard-code the business rule in all clients and hope it doesn’t evolve. If there are not that many of them and you can easily upgrade them, no big deal.</li>
<li>You can prepare for a possible change by making the rate a parameter of the applications you use (when they support it); this will already be better easier in case of adjustment, without a huge upfront cost.</li>
<li>If you foresee changes in the business rules in the coming years and you know adjusting the software will be complicated, maybe you should put the rule in a server-side, centralized, application. Sure, it will be a bit slower, but client-side cache can help and you will be future-proof.</li>
<li>If you are in a situation where lots of business changes are going to happen, and many business rules are going to be dealt with, then you’ll reach the point where investing in a centralized piece of software dedicated to managing your business rules makes sense.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>BRMS as a dedicated tool for business rule handling</h2>
<p>Now, let’s concentrate <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>on this last hypothesis, where you need what is <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>called a <strong class="bold">BRMS</strong>. Again, it is very important to state that this is not a module you will need in every information system and the simplest ones do not justify such an installation effort. But beware that most information systems start simple and become more complex. The real difficulty is that, once you are in production, it is going to be harder to replace existing rules with a BRMS customization since all calls will have to be changed if they have not been unified behind an API contract. This is why this utopic information system makes sense: it shows what you should do (and does not hide the size of the investment) if you are serious with your information system and do not want to take any bets on it. If you know from the start it is going to grow and your activity will become industrial, then you should start with something that might seem overly complex and expensive at first but that will pay back hugely in the future. If you are not convinced about this, simply read all the returns of experience of startups that have failed because they have not invested in their information system, though their idea was customer-approved, their pricing was fine, and they had a market: this is one of the most common reasons for startups to fail, but also bigger companies (the latter, though, generall<a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>y do not provide any feedback).</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Common implementations of business rules</h2>
<p>How would<a id="_idIndexMarker302"/> you go about implementing a BRMS? It may make you smile but, again, Excel is the simplest implementation for a BRMS, most of the time without people knowing it. One accountant will certainly tell you (if you ask) that they do not use any BRMS for their job. But at the same time, they will boast about a hand-crafted Excel workbook with all the calculations (and thus business rules, whether regulatory or company-wise) they need in their day-to-day job as well as for the monthly closing period. What is this if not a BRMS? In fact, due to the relatively rare use of a “true” dedicated BRMS, it simply happens that business rules are contained in Excel files for most small companies.</p>
<p>Within larger companies, there are more business-line applications, such as ERP, or even bespoke software when the companies have internal software development capacity. In this case, the proportion of business rules integrated into the application rises, but this is not necessarily <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>for the best. Why do lots of business-oriented people love Excel spreadsheets despite their shortcomings? Simply because they have full control over it and do not depend on the IT department to make changes, add functions, and so on. Start implementing a business rule inside some application and the coupling problem immediately pops up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to change the rule without recompiling, testing, and deploying the application again?</li>
<li>If the rules can be customized, is it possible to do so via a functional operator or do you need the IT to implement the change (or in the best case, train them)?</li>
<li>How do we deal with rules that must change at a particular date and time (for example January 1 at midnight for lots of accounting-related or business-wide reporting rules)?</li>
<li>Is it possible to have two concurrent versions of the business rule, or are we obliged to stop the software at the end of the year to make sure nothing is done before somebody changes the rule at the beginning of the new year (do not laugh: it happens very often…)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these potential problems, implementing business rules in dedicated business applications is already a nice step forward, particularly if this is done server-side, preferably as the implementation of a well-documented, contract-first API. This solution is less prone to errors than Excel spreadsheets, which might be disseminated across the organization with different implementations of rules, resulting in a mess. It also tends to provide a first level of governance of the business rules since different services are responsible for “their” software applications, and thus for the business rules implemented (or customized) in them.</p>
<p>Still, these implementations are not representative of a BRMS in the sense of our utopic system, namely a unique one that would contain all the business rules of the company. And if you want to go all the way to a future-proof information system, you will rather use something such as Drools (an open source package, declined in JBoss Rules by Red Hat) or IBM Operational Decision Manager. These pieces of software will generally provide the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The execution of business <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>rules, which provides what is called a decision engine (<strong class="bold">DMN</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Decision Model and Notation</strong> and is an accompanying standard of BPMN). If you want to know more about this important bit of a BRMS, I recommend the excellent documentation page from Drools, available at <a href="https://www.drools.org/learn/dmn.html">https://www.drools.org/learn/dmn.html</a>.</li>
<li>Storage for the definition of these business rules, which sounds obvious but isn’t when you add the requirement of storing the whole version history of the business rules.</li>
<li>Use of decision<a id="_idIndexMarker305"/> tables, links between events and actions, and, in the most sophisticated cases, inference engines that are going to mix many different rules to find additional conclusions (an overly simplified example would be that “all purchases need an invoice” and “an invoice must include the buyer’s address in the header,” to “all purchases need the address of the buyer”).</li>
<li>Some of them provide a graphical editor for non-technical people to be able to adjust rules by themselves. Though editors claim anyone can use them, they remain quite technical and require some training.</li>
<li>Together with this, a sandbox is very useful for people to test their business rules adjustments before putting them into production.</li>
<li>Depending on the performance needed and the variation of the calls, a cache mechanism can be a good addition to a BRMS.</li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">Open Policy Agent is a BRMS that is dedicated to authorization rules. <a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>We will show its use in <a href="B21293_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor446"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, after talking about data and business rules, we are going to add the third and last module to complete our ideal IT system.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Processes management in the ideal system</h1>
<p>Our<a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> ideal system handles data and can make decisions on it with business rules, but what makes it tick? In <a href="B21293_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, we stressed that<a id="_idIndexMarker307"/> everything is a question of time, but nothing has the role of putting the data and rules in controlled, time-based, motion. This wi<a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>ll be the role of the process engine.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>Processes as the brain of the information system</h2>
<p>Coming back <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>to our metaphor of the human body, you may have guessed that business process management, as the module that orchestrates the actions of applications containing the business rules over the data, can be associated with the control tower that is the brain. As our brain coordinates the actions of each muscle together with receiving the signals coming from our five senses to achieve complex results such as catching a ball, typing on a keyboard, or dressing, the processes describe the complex tasks that must be accomplished by each part of the information system to reach a global objective, and the BPM engine coordinates these tasks, effectively calling the modules in charge (or rather, the API, which themselves are implemented by technical module; remember the important point we explained in <a href="B21293_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor069"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>?).</p>
<p>If the utopic information system is made of one MDM and one BRMS that contain all the data and all the business rules for each of the business domains, the BPM is the module that makes everything work together, b<a id="_idTextAnchor200"/>y interoperating all of the functions.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>Implementations of a BPM</h2>
<p>Before<a id="_idIndexMarker309"/> talking about technical implementations (and this should be a reflex by now), we have to try and find an accepted standard for our feature. Luckily, an indisputable one exists that we have talked about previously: BPMN. So, if you are looking for an evolutive way of executing processes, where the engine can be completely decoupled from the design, you must use BPMN. I have tested editing BPMN 2.0 on a given editor’s GUI and executing on another editor’s execution engine, and it works well, which says something about the maturity of the norm.</p>
<p>Of course, not<a id="_idIndexMarker310"/> all information systems need the kind of sophistication we are talking about, but all of them use a central orchestration system at some point, even if large parts of it can be manual and processes might not even be designed in BPMN, but only known in their heads by the participants of the information system (again, this does not mean that everything is based on computers). And guess what? When we do not need any complexity at all, we will find our old friend Excel!</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">At this point, I know you must be convinced I am an absolute Excel fan. However, I’m not and I have seen my fair share of huge functional problems because of using Excel for shared data, not controlling its spreading in the organization, and more. I am fully aware of the way it prevents people from working together by making it so easy for almost everyone to have a little part of the information system. But at the same time, I am not in favor of forgetting everything spreadsheets have brought to IT and the empowerment of business specialists. Also, it is not my fault that most information systems nowadays are so unsophisticated! So if you have to use a crude tool to do the job… so be it! And Excel will long remain the “Swiss Army knife” of information systems. You will be better off with a complete toolbox but if you can only have one tool, take this knife rather than the circlip-removing tongs or some other exotic and highly-specialized utensil. Going back to the software, better alternatives for MDM, BRMS, and BPM exist today than an Excel spreadsheet. However, if you are aware of Excel’s drawbacks and control them, its versatility and ease of use will speed you up in many parts of the information system. In particular, though MDM and BPM are much better outside Excel, I have often set up some “low-quality BRMS” by putting complex calculations in Excel and plugging the spreadsheet into APIs with great business success. Yes, this is somewhat of a hack, but so long as it is hidden behind an API, there is no problem with a temporary, quick, and dirty implemen<a id="_idTextAnchor202"/>tation… and the business users LOVED it!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/>How close can we get to this utopic system?</h1>
<p>So far, we have described the <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>contents of an ideal information system, as described by Dominique Vauquier in his seminal book. This assembly of MDM + BRMS + BPM will also be found in some other sources, such as the “sustainable information system” described by the SHIFT project in its approach to the digital transformation toward a more ecologically friendly IT industry, or<a id="_idIndexMarker312"/> the <strong class="bold">Agility Chain Management System</strong> (<strong class="bold">ACMS</strong>) approach.</p>
<p>Of course, this is an ideal vision, so the question is not to use it as a blueprint that actual information systems should all be based on, but how close we can get to it when designing new infor<a id="_idTextAnchor204"/>mation systems or improving existing ones.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/>Favoring contexts</h2>
<p>Various <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>context elements <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>may favor the use of the approach discussed in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">A brand new information system</strong>: If you are lucky enough to start from scratch with a newly-created organization, the legacy will not hold you back and this is a huge factor that can make an ideal information system come to life.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Degree of sophistication</strong>: This will not be enough, of course, because as stated previously, there is a place for such an ideal system only when it is justified by business. If your information system has to be highly evolutive because business rules and markets are changing very often, data structures are unclear, and processes must be adapted quickly, then this is another factor that can favor the adoption of the architecture explained previously.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Investment approval</strong>: Once again, this factor is not enough because the business may need such a highly sophisticated information system but the investors might not be aware of this. For lots of CEOs, IT is just a cost center. But if you understand that information systems have become the backbones of most industrial activities, you have one more positive factor.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Capacity of implementation</strong>: Everything seems fine, but do not underestimate the difficulty of implementing such an information system. This approach is so different from what most professionals know that you will have difficulty finding people able to deploy it. You will have to convince them, train them, and adjust them to your way with very little existing feedback and return on experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Admittedly, these are a<a id="_idIndexMarker315"/> lot of factors and chances are you will not have them now. For people my age, there is even a chance that we’ll never see such a perfect alignment that would make this utopic structure the most used one. But it exists – its advantages are obvious and the accelerating rate of changes and digital transformation of the industry will, without any doubt, make it a more and more observed option. A technical watch also shows that, in the past 3 to 5 years, the subject of MDM has advanced and some advanced companies have put them in place, together with an internal developer platform, bringing them some very interesting results. In short, we are at the very beginning of the trend, but <a id="_idTextAnchor206"/>the chances that the wave will grow are high.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/>Approaching the target, the Agile way</h2>
<p>The fact that such <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>ideal information systems are not mainstream yet and will not be the standard in the near future does not mean that they have no interest. It would be a bit like somebody working in an Agile team <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>who would not want to know what the vision of the final software is, arguing that they are only interested in what will be done in the current sprint!</p>
<p>An ideal – a vision – is also there to provide direction, somewhere to guide our trip. Remember the metaphor of the arrow? We must know what the target looks like to locate it and reach it; otherwise, we are just randomly walking around, hoping for the best. In conclusion, please do not discard this concept because it is not immediately practical: knowing it can help you make choices in the future between different directions of your information system because you will feel closer to this long-term, ideal, direction that will bring you better value. Chances are you will never reach the ideal state, but hopefully, the direction taken will bear more value and flexibility to your information system. The state of information systems nowadays is so poor that having something above average is already a huge advantage in the era<a id="_idTextAnchor208"/> of digitalization of all industrial processes.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we presented what could be an ideal information system. We talked about all the problems that can arise in software industrial deployments, particularly concerning their evolution, so it was quite logical to show not only punctual solutions but also how the problem could be addressed globally. Of course, a fair part of this approach remains utopic, but this exercise is interesting in the fact that it shows that only three modules, if very well built, can serve any business needs. The separation between data, business rules, and business processes is something that should be kept in mind even if the information system you work with is far from being ideal.</p>
<p>This chapter was quite conceptual, but this concludes the first part of this book, which was meant to cover a lot of theoretical background. The next part of this book will cover more practical methods for architecture and, to be fully articulated between theory and practice (which is the main premise of this book), the third part will provide source code to show you how to implement the concepts and approaches of sound architecture that we have talked about. In particular, the three main modules that have been explained here will be shown in a sample application with a limited functional perimeter, but with all the sophistication needed to grow to a full-fledged information system if needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The MDM will be based on a NoSQL database, with a back office server in ASP.NET that exposes API-designed contract-first</li>
<li>A separate BRMS will be used for authorization management</li>
<li>A BPM approach will be held to show how to make processes adjustable, with a low-code implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, in the next seven chapters, we will use battle-hardened methods to design the sample application by using examples that apply to parts of the use cases we will need. This, in the following five chapters, will be used to implement the sample application, module by module. Finally, the last three chapters will be about deploying and adjusting this sample application, just like if it were in production. As time passes by, adjustments need to be made to keep it aligned with the functional business needs.</p>
