    to create an immersive experience that makes users feel as though they are physically
    present in a digital world, interacting with the environment and objects as they
    would in real life. Key components of a VR system include **head-mounted displays**
    (**HMDs**), controllers, and tracking systems. HMDs, such as the Oculus Rift and
    HTC Vive, provide stereoscopic displays and a wide field of view, essential for
    immersion. Controllers and tracking systems enable interaction with the virtual

    engaging multiple senses and providing interactive experiences, VR can transport
    users to entirely new worlds. This has profound applications not only in gaming
    but also in fields such as education, healthcare, and real estate. For instance,
    VR can be used to simulate surgical procedures for training doctors or to create
    virtual tours of properties for potential buyers. In downtown Tampa, Florida,
    a real estate developer has even generated a digital twin of the city ([https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/transforming-real-estate-visualization-with-an-xr-based-digital-twin-of-tampa](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/transforming-real-estate-visualization-with-an-xr-based-digital-twin-of-tampa))
