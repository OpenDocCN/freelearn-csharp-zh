But the application has a lot more possibilities regarding accounting and financial management. In this chapter, we will briefly explain all the other possibilities, which include the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Currencies</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Intercompany postings</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Accounting implications of other areas</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">XBRL</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">E-services and document management</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec50"/>Currencies</h1></div></div></div><p>Different countries use different currencies. The application can post transactions such as invoices or payments in different currencies and translate them into the <strong>local currency</strong> (<strong>LCY</strong>) according to the corresponding exchange rate.</p><p>Imagine that your local currency is Euro (EUR) and you sell your products or services to the United States of America, where the currency used is Dollar (USD).</p><p>You would first assign the USD currency to all those customers who do use this currency. You do so in the <strong>Currency Code</strong> field found in the <strong>Foreign Trade</strong> FastTab of the customer card.
</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip40"/>Tip</h3><p>Always leave the <strong>Currency Code</strong> field blank when using the local currency.</p></div></div><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_07_01.jpg" alt="Currencies"/></div><p>
</p><p>Then, you would inform the correct exchange rate by navigating to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Periodic Activities</strong> | <strong>Currency</strong> | <strong>Currencies</strong>, selecting the appropriate currency, and clicking on <strong>Exchange Rate</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_07_02.jpg" alt="Currencies"/></div><p>
</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note41"/>Note</h3><p>Exchange rates have to be frequently updated in Dynamics NAV because they change constantly.</p></div></div><p>Now, if you prepare an invoice for this customer, you will see that the USD currency is used. This means that prices and amounts will be in dollars; however, you can always see the conversions to your local currency in all those fields that have the LCY acronym.</p><p>In the general ledger, amounts will always be shown on local currency. In other places, such as the posted invoice or the customer ledger entry, amounts will be shown both in local currency and in the used currency.</p><p>Currencies are available in the following application areas:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Customers, vendors, and banks</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">All transactions that can be done with a customer, a vendor, or a bank, such as invoices, payments, and so on</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Definition of item sales and purchase prices</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Definition of resources, sales prices, and so on</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec51"/>Intercompany postings</h1></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Intercompany postings</strong> are useful when you manage multiple companies at the same time and those companies do transactions between them (that is, a subsidiary company buys or sells products or services to another subsidiary company).</p><p>The intercompany functionality allows you to define the mapping between the items and chart of accounts of company A and the items and chart of accounts of company B. When company A wants to buy items from company B, company A creates a purchase order and then sends it electronically to company B. In company B, a sales order is automatically created with the appropriate items or G/L accounts. This way, the information is introduced only once and carried to the corresponding companies in the corresponding way.</p><p>Intercompany postings use a number of entries and documents for the relevant transactions:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">General journal entries</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Purchase and sales orders</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Purchase and sales invoices</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Credit memos</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Return orders</li></ul></div><p>To set up Intercompany postings, the company must create a list of IC partners and an IC chart of accounts:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem"><strong>Intercompany (IC) partners</strong>: Set up customers and vendors as business partners and assign them IC partner codes. This permits exchange of IC purchase and sales documents, including items and item charges. You can do this by navigating to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Application Setup</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Intercompany Postings</strong> | <strong>IC Partners</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_07_03.jpg" alt="Intercompany postings"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem"><strong>IC chart of accounts</strong>: Before IC partners can begin to transfer IC transactions electronically, each company must set up the IC chart of accounts in their company. You can do this by navigating to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Application Setup</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Intercompany Postings</strong> | <strong>IC Chart of Accounts</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_07_04.jpg" alt="Intercompany postings"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem"><strong>IC</strong> <strong>journals</strong>: These are used to post transactions with your intercompany partners. When you post an intercompany journal, a corresponding journal is created in your IC outbox that you can transfer to your partner. Your partner can then post the journal in their company, without having to re-enter the data:<div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In the search box, enter <code class="literal">IC General Journal</code>, and/or you can navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>General Ledger</strong> | <strong>IC General Journal</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Enter the details as follows:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">In the <strong>Account Type</strong> field, select <strong>IC Partner</strong>. In the <strong>Account No.</strong> field, select the IC partner code that you will send the transaction to.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">In the <strong>IC Partner G/L Acc. No.</strong> field, enter the IC general ledger account that the amount will be posted to in your partner's company.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">After filling in the fields, post the journal.</li></ul></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec52"/>Accounting implications of other areas</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, we saw the financial management of Dynamics NAV and also the accounting implication the sales and the purchase areas have. Other functional areas such as jobs, service, warehouse, or manufacturing also have some kind of accounting implications that will be briefly explained in this section.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec66"/>Jobs</h2></div></div></div><p>The Job functional area is meant to manage projects and perform tasks such as configuring the job, scheduling resources, monitor progress, and so on.</p><p>This area has two kinds of accounting implications, which are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It can create sales invoices. The accounting implication of those sales invoices are the same as regular sales invoices.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Work in Process</strong> (<strong>WIP</strong>) can be calculated and posted to the general ledger. Multiple WIP methods can be configured to calculate WIP for a specific job.</li></ul></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec67"/>Service</h2></div></div></div><p>The Service functional area is meant to manage post-sale services and maintain a record of customers.</p><p>Within this area, service invoices can be created and posted, which will end up in postings to the general ledger and in customer ledger entries that will have to be paid later on.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec68"/>Warehouse</h2></div></div></div><p>The Warehouse functional area is meant to manage all warehouse-related processes, such as receiving items from vendors, stocking them into the warehouse, picking and sending items to customers and perform the necessary internal item movements.</p><p>This area is all about items. Items have a cost that has to be posted to the general ledger in order to be able to know our inventory valuation. We have already talked about inventory valuation earlier on this book.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec69"/>Manufacturing</h2></div></div></div><p>The Manufacturing functional area is meant to manage and plan the transformation of inputs into finished goods.</p><p>This area has two kinds of accounting implications:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It works with items, which have a cost that has to be posted to the general ledger in order to be able to know our inventory valuation. We have already talked about inventory valuation earlier on this book.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">WIP can be calculated and posted to the general ledger.</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec53"/>XBRL</h1></div></div></div><p>
<strong>eXtensible Business Reporting Language</strong> (<strong>XBRL</strong>) is a global standard for exchanging business information such as financial statements or other such information. Dynamics NAV can export financial data using the XBRL standard.</p><p>The idea is that someone who wants to get financial information from you would provide you a taxonomy (an XML document), which would contain one or more schemas with lines you should fill out. You would import this taxonomy into the program and fill out the schema or schemas by entering the account or accounts that correspond to each line in the schema and other required information. Once it is filled out, export it from the application and send it to the requester.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec54"/>E-services and document management</h1></div></div></div><p>Microsoft dynamics NAV 2016 allows you to capture and store invoices and credit memos as incoming documents and use them to create corresponding purchase documents or journal lines. As an alternative to e-mailing as file attachments, you can send and receive documents electronically. By electronic document, we mean a standard-compliant file representing a business document, such as an invoice from a vendor that you can receive and convert to a purchase invoice in Microsoft Dynamics NAV. The exchange of electronic documents between two trading partners is performed by an external provider of document exchange services.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec55"/>Document exchange service</h1></div></div></div><p>The Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2016 version supports sending and receiving electronic invoices and credit memos in the PEPPOL format, which is supported by the largest providers of document exchange services. A major provider of document exchange services is preconfigured and ready to be set up for your company. You can perform the Document Exchange Service setup by navigating to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>IT Administration</strong> | <strong>Services</strong> | <strong>Document Exchange Service setup</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_07_06.jpg" alt="Document exchange service"/></div><p>
</p><p>Once you enable the <code class="literal">Document Exchange Service</code> setup, these <strong>Job Queue</strong> entries will be auto-created:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_07_07.jpg" alt="Document exchange service"/></div><p>
</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec56"/>The OCR service</h1></div></div></div><p>From PDF or image files representing incoming documents, you can have an external <strong>Optical Character Recognition</strong> (<strong>OCR</strong>) service to create electronic documents that you can then convert to document records in Microsoft Dynamics NAV, like for electronic PEPPOL documents. For example, when you receive an invoice in the PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the <strong>Incoming Documents</strong> window. After a few seconds, you will receive the file back as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor. If you send the file to the OCR service by e-mail, then a new incoming document record is automatically created when you receive the electronic document back.</p><p>Then, you can set up the OCR service by navigating to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>IT Administration</strong> | <strong>Services</strong> | <strong>OCR Service setup</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_07_08.jpg" alt="The OCR service"/></div><p>
</p><p>Once you enable the <code class="literal">OCR</code> setup, these <strong>Job Queue</strong> entries will be auto-created:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_07_09.jpg" alt="The OCR service"/></div><p>
</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec57"/>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</h1></div></div></div><p>You can send attachments by e-mail from Microsoft Dynamics NAV. The default e-mail sender address is based on the settings in the <strong>SMTP Mail Setup</strong> window. If SMTP is not configured or Outlook is not available, the <code class="literal">.pdf</code> file will open instead.</p><p>Then, you can perform the SMTP Mail setup by navigating to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>IT Administration</strong> | <strong>Services</strong> | <strong>SMTP Mail setup</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_07_10.jpg" alt="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)"/></div><p>
</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec58"/>Process</h1></div></div></div><p>We can test the whole process in <strong>Sales Invoice</strong> and send it electronically. For this, check the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Create the sales invoice by navigating to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Sales Marketing</strong> | <strong>Sales Invoice</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Select <strong>10000</strong> as the customer number.</li><li class="listitem">Select the <strong>Bicycle</strong> item in the <strong>Lines</strong> area with the quantity <strong>1</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Action pane, click on <strong>Post</strong> and send it as follows:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_07_11.jpg" alt="Process"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec59"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, you learned about other possibilities of the financial management area of Dynamics NAV, such as the use of multiple currencies, intercompany postings, the accounting implications of other areas, the XBRL standard for reporting business information, document exchange by PEPPOL, and LCS.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will work on fixed assets, where we will see the complete life cycle of fixed asset from acquisition to disposal, maintenance expenses, budgeted asset, and how to insure fixed assets in NAV 2016.</p></div></body></html>
