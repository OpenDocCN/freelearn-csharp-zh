			<h1 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Additional Resources and Libraries</h1>
			<p>At this point, you have everything that you need to start building outstanding CLI applications. In the pages of this book, we have covered every step of the way: setting up your development environment, understanding the foundations of CLI applications, developing a CLI application ‚Äì from the basic concepts to the most advanced ones, testing, security, performance optimization, and finally packaging <span class="No-Break">and deployment.</span></p>
			<p>However, while developing your CLI applications, you may face situations where you need to deepen your skills in one or more of these areas. You may also face situations where you will need to design a complex feature or code. These are situations every developer faces, no matter what kind of applications they build, and you <span class="No-Break">will too.</span></p>
			<p>That‚Äôs why I designed this last chapter: to give you some guidance in these situations so you don‚Äôt get lost. Use it as a reference whenever you <span class="No-Break">need guidance.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>Further reading and resources</h1>
			<p>While there are a lot of very interesting things to read on the web, I will mention some books from the Packt Publishing collection that I‚Äôve found <span class="No-Break">particularly useful.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>C# 12 and .NET 8, by Mark J. Price</h2>
			<p>If you are learning .NET, it is impossible not to recommend Mark J. Price‚Äôs book. This book covers everything you need to know about .NET development. Also, Mark updates his book with every new version of .NET. The latest edition, at the time of writing, is the one covering .<span class="No-Break">NET 8.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>Refactoring with C#, by Matt Eland</h2>
			<p>When building your CLI application, you will most likely have to deal with existing code, and you may need to refactor it in order to make it safer and improve its performance. When this happens, you will be happy to have this book <span class="No-Break">on hand.</span></p>
			<p>By reading this book, you will learn many refactoring techniques that take advantage of the latest C# features. You will also learn how to leverage AI assistants, such as GitHub Copilot Chat, for your refactoring, testing, <span class="No-Break">and documentation.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>Pragmatic Test-Driven Development in C# and .NET, by Adam Tibi</h2>
			<p>You simply cannot guarantee the quality of your application if you don‚Äôt implement automated testing. Although you can implement automated testing without <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>relying on <strong class="bold">Test-Driven Development</strong> (<strong class="bold">TDD</strong>), as I used to say in every class where I teach this topic: ‚Äú<em class="italic">Automated testing ensures that your code performs the task it has been designed for, while TDD ensures that your code performs the task stated by your business requirements.</em>‚Äù This summarizes the difference between <em class="italic">simple </em>automated tests and the practice <span class="No-Break">of TDD.</span></p>
			<p>This book covers what you need to know not only to implement unit testing in your application (including mocking external dependencies) but also to integrate a <span class="No-Break">TDD practice.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>C# 7 and .NET Core 2.0 High Performance, by Ovais Mehboob Ahmed Khan</h2>
			<p>Although this book relies on an older version of .NET, the concepts and principles it teaches are still valuable <span class="No-Break">and applicable.</span></p>
			<p>By reading this book, you will understand the most common pitfalls that negatively impact your application‚Äôs performance. You will also learn how to measure the performance of your application (as a whole, but more importantly at its hot paths). You will then learn design and memory management techniques (including async programming, multithreading, and optimized data structures) that will help you improve the performance of <span class="No-Break">your application.</span></p>

			<p>These readings will give you a deeper knowledge and understanding of various topics covered throughout <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p>However, you will find that, in many situations, a library already exists for what you are trying to achieve. You <em class="italic">should</em> consider using <span class="No-Break">such libraries.</span></p>
			<p>I‚Äôm highlighting ‚Äúshould‚Äù here on purpose. My point is that you don‚Äôt have to use any library, but you have to, at least, disregard a library consciously after analyzing it and deciding that it doesn‚Äôt suit <span class="No-Break">your needs.</span></p>
			<p>By relying on an existing library, you avoid having to write extra code, maintain it, and test it. You simply use it as a means to achieve your goal <span class="No-Break">more quickly.</span></p>
			<p>If you have been developing for a long enough period of time, you will most likely have encountered libraries that you found useful and that you reused over and over in your projects. In the next section, I will share with you some of the libraries that I have discovered (and used) along <span class="No-Break">my journey.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-239"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Useful libraries for CLI application development</h1>
			<p>There are plenty of useful libraries and this section doesn‚Äôt intend to list them all (we would need an encyclopedia for that üòâ). Also, the ones listed here are by no means the best ones. They are the ones I‚Äôve discovered along the way and use on a regular basis. These libraries add up to the ones we have already used throughout the pages of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-240"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>Polly</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Polly</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>resilience and<a id="_idIndexMarker558"/> transient fault-handling library.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>With the help of these readings and libraries, you can take your CLI applications to the next level and build some quite impressive and useful ones. I am eager to see what you will create. Do not hesitate to let <span class="No-Break">me know.</span></p>
			<p>One more thing: this list is not frozen in time. It is alive and you should keep it alive. How? By continually revisiting it and updating it as technology and trends evolve. I am passing this mission on <span class="No-Break">to you.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Your turn!</h1>
			<p>Following along with the provided code is a great way to learn <span class="No-Break">through practice.</span></p>
			<p>A better way is by challenging yourself to achieve tasks. Hence, I challenge you to improve the <strong class="bold">Bookmarkr</strong> application by adding the <span class="No-Break">following features.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Task #1 ‚Äì List additional features for Bookmarkr</h2>
			<p>This is where I hand you <strong class="bold">Bookmarkr</strong> so you can make it <span class="No-Break">your own.</span></p>
			<p>I am challenging you to list some additional features you would like to have in <strong class="bold">Bookmarkr</strong>. You can add them as feature requests in GitHub so either you or someone else can <span class="No-Break">implement them.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Task #2 ‚Äì List the skills and libraries you need to implement a feature</h2>
			<p>Once you have decided what features you would like to implement, start by listing the skills and libraries you need to do so. The purpose of this step is to avoid having to reinvent the wheel but rather take advantage of what already exists and use it to achieve <span class="No-Break">new horizons.</span></p>
			<p>Remember: your users aren‚Äôt interested in your coding skills (they won‚Äôt even see the code). They are interested in the value your (CLI) application <span class="No-Break">brings them.</span></p>
