- en: '[Chapter 4](049a0a4b-74b6-41a1-92db-87a4f8af9fd1.xhtml),  *Deciding the Best
    Cloud-Based Solution*, is a general introduction to the cloud and Azure. There,
    you find all relevant cloud concepts and a description of the overall Azure offering,
    together with examples that show how you can configure resources in the cloud
    to meet your needs. [Chapter 5](49aed8bb-9a4a-4241-9efc-f53c3f53dd5a.xhtml), *Applying
    a Microservice Architecture to Your Enterprise Application*, describes the microservice
    computational model, which is the most efficacious way to achieve flexibility,
    high throughput, and reliability in the cloud. There, you can learn also about
    containers and Docker, which will enable you to mix different technologies in
    your architecture and to make your software platform-independent.'

    with Azure Functions*, you will learn about the serverless model of computation,
    which is included in all main cloud offerings, and understand how to use it in
    the Azure cloud. Thanks to serverless, you can run your computations just when
    they are needed without preallocating cloud resources, and you can do so while
    paying only for the actual computation time.
