<h1 id="_idParaDest-18">Understanding XR and its different forms (VR, AR, and MR)</h1>
<p>XR is an <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>all-encompassing term that includes a range of technologies designed to enhance our senses. Whether it’s providing additional information about <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>the physical <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>world or creating entirely <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>new, simulated worlds<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> for us<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> to explore, XR comprises <strong class="bold">Virtual Reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">VR</strong>), <strong class="bold">Augmented Reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">AR</strong>), and <strong class="bold">Mixed Reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">MR</strong>) technologies. You <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>may be someone who has already put on multiple <strong class="bold">XR headsets</strong>, lost <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>yourself in immersive <strong class="bold">VR games</strong> such as <em class="italic">Beat Saber</em>, or <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>even <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>have a <strong class="bold">VR headset</strong> of your own. If so, you already have a pretty good idea of what XR is. You may know that while VR implies a complete immersion experience that shuts out the physical world, AR and MR combine the real and virtual worlds with each other. However, can you pinpoint the differences between AR and MR?</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-19">What is the difference between A<a id="_idTextAnchor001"/>R and MR?</h2>
<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>explore this through an example – imagine you’re <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>wearing a <em class="italic">Meta Quest 3 </em>headset. This headset comes <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>equipped with cameras that allow passthrough capabilities – a feature enabling you to view your real-world surroundings while also being immersed in the virtual environment. When these cameras are active, you’re essentially in an MR experience. For instance, as you stand in your living room, you might spot an ancient vase on your coffee table. In actuality, your coffee table is real, but the vase is a virtual object seamlessly integrated through MR. The true magic of MR lies in its ability to intertwine the digital and physical worlds so intimately that it becomes challenging to differentiate between them. When the passthrough is disabled, however, the headset returns to a purely VR experience, detaching you from the physical world’s view.</p>
<p>In contrast, AR enhances our experience of the real world by projecting digital information onto it. When <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>wearing <strong class="bold">AR glasses</strong>, such as <em class="italic">HoloLens</em> or <em class="italic">Magic Leap</em>, there’s<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> a clear delineation between the real and virtual elements in <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>your view. For instance, imagine wearing AR glasses and seeing interactive labels hovering next to objects in your room, such as a floating note reminding you to water a plant or arrows directing you to a misplaced item.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are mobile AR devices, where the augmentation is experienced through a smartphone or tablet screen. These devices provide a windowed experience of the augmented world – for example, games<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> such as <em class="italic">Pokémon Go</em>, where you use your smartphone’s camera to spot virtual creatures in the real world, or an app that lets you visualize how a piece of furniture looks in your room before purchasing.</p>
<p>AR strives to enhance our current reality, but MR pushes the boundaries of imagination to envision a world where real and virtual objects merge seamlessly, while VR creates a completely alternative reality altogether. Many find it challenging to differentiate between MR headsets and AR glasses, but the display serves as a good indicator. AR glasses utilize transparent displays instead of cameras, granting them direct access to real-world lighting for seamless integration of digital overlays. In contrast, MR headsets allow users to view the environment through additional sensors and cameras, but they do not provide direct access to sunlight. It’s like a spectrum of reality – at one end, we have the familiar and the real, subtly enhanced with digital elements; at the other end, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>entirely invented worlds, with <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>limitless potential for exploration and adventure. And somewhere in between, we have the magical space where the real and virtual merge, seamlessly blending the best of both worlds. Can you guess which idea dates back the earliest – VR, AR, or MR? And how did XR enter the picture?</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20">How did AR, VR, MR, and XR evolve?</h2>
<p>Although VR <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>certainly is the most advanced of these technologies <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>to date, it was the author of <em class="italic">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>, L. Frank Baum, who predicted AR in his 1901 novel <em class="italic">The Master Key: An Electrical Fairy Tale and the Optimism of Its Devotees</em>. Nevertheless, it <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>was not until half a century had passed that the <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>first aspirations of meandering through virtual realms and augmenting our reality truly took flight.</p>
<p>In 1962, Morton Heilig<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> introduced the <em class="italic">Sensorama</em> – a device that plays with more senses than modern VR headsets. In one of the Sensorama’s experiences, you were teleported into a mythical jungle, and could hear the calls of tropical birds, smell the moist soil, and feel the mild breeze on your face as you wandered on a thin trail. In another experience, you rode a quad through a desert, inhaling the smell of hot rocks through your nose, feeling the wind hitting your cheeks from different angles as you made a turn, and listening to the symphony of the wind flowing down the dunes and the quad’s rusty motor. The Sensorama consisted of a stereoscopic color display, fans to simulate wind, odor emitters creating different smells with chemicals, a movable chair, and a stereo-sound system (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSINEBZNCks">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSINEBZNCks</a>).</p>
<p>The emergence of XR technology was a rocky and unpredictable journey. Following the Sensorama’s sensory immersion, which painted a splendid vision of blended realities within reach, the 1990s witnessed a VR terrain strewn <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>with the debris of ill-fated contraptions, such<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> as <em class="italic">Sega VR</em> and <em class="italic">Nintendo Virtual Boy</em>. They failed <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>to ignite the consumer’s imagination. As a result, the momentum of <strong class="bold">Head-Mounted Displays</strong> (<strong class="bold">HMDs</strong>) began to wane.</p>
<p>This is why researchers at Indiana University invented a completely different XR technology <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>called the <strong class="bold">Computer Automatic Virtual Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">CAVE</strong>). This technology enables viewers standing inside a cube and wearing 3D glasses to see any 3D graphics projected onto the walls, ceiling, and floor as if they’re floating in space. Users wander through the scenes, observing the projected objects from any angle. CAVEs can usually host up to 10 people, all of whom might be standing in front of a virtual replica of Michelangelo’s David statue, viewing the masterpiece from any angle, plunging into the rollercoaster of evoked emotions, and capturing every slight edge with their eyes. As CAVEs enabled high-resolution XR experiences at a time when heavy HMDs with low-quality resolution were the only alternative, they seemed to be the most promising way to experience XR for a few years. So, which factors led to the widespread adoption of HMDs to experience virtual words, while the seemingly superior CAVEs failed to gain significant traction?</p>
<p>Installing a CAVE costs a pile of money, often hundreds of thousands of dollars, paired with high monthly maintenance and usage costs. Setting up a CAVE can be tiring. You need to properly adjust the projectors, add appropriate lighting and air conditioning, and coordinate a network of computers to ensure the projectors seamlessly synchronize with one another. Most importantly, CAVEs fall short when it comes to multiple individual experiences or immersive storylines that demand interactive engagement between the users and the application: <a href="https://sky-real.com/news/the-vr-cave-halfway-between-reality-and-virtuality/">https://sky-real.com/news/the-vr-cave-halfway-between-reality-and-virtuality/</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070109083006/http://inkido.indiana.edu/a100/handouts/cave_out.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20070109083006/http://inkido.indiana.edu/a100/handouts/cave_out.html</a>.</p>
<p>After a bleak winter in XR development, marked by the dashed excitement over CAVEs and a slew of failed HMDs, a glimmer of hope emerged in the early 2000s. In 2005, the world witnessed the birth of the<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> first-ever <strong class="bold">AR app</strong> called <em class="italic">AR Tennis</em>. This game could be played by two people, armed only with a <em class="italic">Nokia</em> phone and a sense of adventure. Using the phone’s camera, a marker was tracked, and voilà – a tennis court sprang to life on the screen. Both participants could interact with a virtual ball, court, and opponent, all simulated within the device. The mobile phone itself functions as the racquet, allowing for an immersive gameplay experience (<a href="https://www.imgawards.com/games/ar-tennis/">https://www.imgawards.com/games/ar-tennis/</a>).</p>
<p>In 2012, <em class="italic">Palmer Luckey</em>, often regarded as the father of modern VR for his pioneering work, marked another milestone in XR development with the introduction of a crowdfunded VR headset known as <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>the <em class="italic">Oculus Rift</em>. Luckey founded <em class="italic">Oculus VR</em>, the <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>project’s parent company, which was eventually acquired by <em class="italic">Facebook</em> in 2014 (<a href="https://history-computer.com/oculus-history/">https://history-computer.com/oculus-history/</a>). The following year, <em class="italic">Microsoft</em> unveiled its <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>groundbreaking <em class="italic">HoloLens</em> <strong class="bold">AR headset</strong>, which seamlessly blended high-definition holograms with the real world (<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-au/2016/10/12/microsoft-announces-global-expansion-for-hololens/">https://news.microsoft.com/en-au/2016/10/12/microsoft-announces-global-expansion-for-hololens/</a>). In 2016, <em class="italic">Niantic</em> released <em class="italic">Pokémon Go</em>, a game that would go on to capture the hearts of millions <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>and usher in a new era of <strong class="bold">AR games</strong>. Like wildfire, the game’s popularity spread across the globe, igniting a new wave of excitement and enthusiasm for AR technology.</p>
<p>In 2017, <em class="italic">IKEA</em> introduced its famous AR app, allowing customers to transcend the limits of imagination and see how IKEA’s furniture would look in their homes, without ever leaving the comfort of their own couch.</p>
<p>Today, we have arrived at a pivotal moment in XR history, where the technology has never been more thrilling, and the possibilities never more endless. From its humble beginnings as a niche industry, XR is now poised to explode into every aspect of our lives, like a supernova of innovation and progress. In 2021, Mark Zuckerberg unveiled his bold vision for the future – a world where<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> immersive, practical <strong class="bold">XR devices</strong> are not just a novelty but also an essential tool to enhance our lives and make our everyday joys even more extraordinary. <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>The year 2022 saw the launch of the <em class="italic">Meta Quest Pro</em>, marking the first time <em class="italic">Meta</em> dipped its toe into releasing <strong class="bold">MR headsets</strong>, after covering a global market share of 81% with their VR headsets, such as the <em class="italic">Meta Quest </em><em class="italic">2</em> (<a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-xr-ar-vr-headsets-market-share/">https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-xr-ar-vr-headsets-market-share/</a>).</p>
<p>However, even as XR technology becomes more advanced and sophisticated, there are still some who believe in making it accessible to all. The founders of the <strong class="bold">Open Source Community for Augmented Reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">OpenAR</strong>), a <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>group dedicated to democratizing AR, have created DIY Open AR Glasses, a budget-friendly project that empowers anyone to build their <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>own <strong class="bold">AR glasses</strong> with just €20 (<a href="https://sites.uef.fi/openar/">https://sites.uef.fi/openar/</a> and <a href="https://openar.fi/">https://openar.fi/</a>). It is beautiful to witness how technology can be used to bring people together and make the world a better place.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-21">How did Unity evolve as a platform for XR development?</h1>
<p><em class="italic">Unity Technologies</em>, now a <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>billion-dollar titan in the realms of gaming and XR, emerged from humble origins in a cozy Copenhagen flat in 2004. The company’s journey to dominating the market with its <em class="italic">Unity game engine</em> has been equally fraught with uncertainty and turbulence, like that of XR technologies.</p>
<p>In 2002, a Danish graphics student sought aid on a digital forum, where a Berliner high schooler with backend experience joined him. Serendipity united their game studio dreams. With only a father’s financial cushion and café wages, they created their first game in 2005 – an alien, trapped in a life-support sphere, navigating Earth. Players tilted the world, and the alien rolled, gathering gems and evading CIA capture, utilizing wall-sticking and jumping tricks. The game’s difficulty overshadowed its cutting-edge lighting, and it found little success. Recognizing their talent for building tools and prototypes, the duo refocused their energy on crafting a game engine for the Mac community, dubbing it Unity – a symbol of collaboration and compatibility (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/how-unity-built-the-worlds-most-popular-game-engine/">https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/how-unity-built-the-worlds-most-popular-game-engine/</a>).</p>
<p>Today, Unity’s fame<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> in the realm of mobile game creation is legendary, with good cause. As the architect behind nearly half the globe’s games, it stands as the model for countless developers to aspire to. Yet, Unity’s reach extends far beyond just gaming. It’s increasingly used for 3D design and simulations across other industries such as film, automotive, and architecture. In fact, Unity is used to create a stunning 60% of all AR and VR experiences worldwide (<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/unity-deempind-ai/">https://www.dailydot.com/debug/unity-deempind-ai/</a>).</p>
<p>In the world of high-end filmmaking, VR and the Unity Game Engine are the hottest ingredients to create a cinematic masterpiece. Disney’s Oscar winner <em class="italic">The Jungle Book</em>, Spielberg’s <em class="italic">Ready Player One</em>, and Oscar winner <em class="italic">Blade Runner 2049</em> all owe their stunning visuals to these breakthrough technologies (<a href="https://unity.com/madewith/virtual-cinematography">https://unity.com/madewith/virtual-cinematography</a>). <em class="italic">The Lion King</em>, a technical wonder in the realm of photo-realistic animation, is no exception. From every bone and breath to each muscle and whisker, every aspect of the African lions was carefully observed in nature and simulated in Unity to mimic real-life lions as closely as possible, while retaining the distinguished features of the original animated movie (<a href="https://ai.umich.edu/blog-posts/how-disneys-the-lion-king-became-a-pioneer-in-the-use-of-virtual-reality/">https://ai.umich.edu/blog-posts/how-disneys-the-lion-king-became-a-pioneer-in-the-use-of-virtual-reality/</a>).</p>
<p>Beyond the realm of filmmaking, XR development in Unity has the potential to transform the very way we communicate and interact with each other. Through the use of immersive virtual environments and<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> cutting-edge <strong class="bold">Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) and emotion systems, XR has the power to create non-linear narratives, personalized experiences, and dynamic interactions that blur the lines between reality and fantasy. From education and training to gaming and social media, the possibilities for XR are endless, and Unity is at the forefront of this exciting new frontier.</p>
<p>XR development<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> in Unity enabled experiences unlike anything the world had ever seen before, such as the award-winning VR game <em class="italic">Bonfire</em>, where <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>you’re stranded on a desolate planet with only a flickering bonfire. Your survival depends on building a rapport with an extraterrestrial who speaks no known language and relies solely on your non-verbal cues and gestures. The result is magical, non-verbal communication, accompanied by a completely organic, non-linear storyline, driven by sophisticated AI and emotion systems that adapt to your every move in real time.</p>
<p>Unity’s XR development not only transforms gaming but also revolutionizes healthcare, as exemplified by <em class="italic">VirtaMed’s</em> innovative applications that reshape the way surgeons acquire surgical skills. The <strong class="bold">MR simulator</strong> mimics every action of a real surgical operation, from the subtlest <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>movements to complications such as unexpected bleeding and bile leakage. Every trainee’s move is recorded with millimeter accuracy, providing valuable feedback. Simulated training accelerates the learning curve for aspiring surgeons, allowing them to enter the operating room with greater confidence and skill.</p>
