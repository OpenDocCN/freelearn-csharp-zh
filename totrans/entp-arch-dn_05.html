<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">But who created the computer first? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Human, of course. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">So, the joke was not about the fact that humans should not touch computers at all, but rather create them and then let them do the work without changing anything afterward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">Of course, this would only be possible if the first attempt was, through some kind of a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">miracle, perfect.</span></span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">This chapter will describe what would resemble this 100% ideal information system, with an ability to adapt to the ever-changing business changes and still perform in terms of speed and robustness, as well as energy efficiency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Such a system was imagined by Dominique Vauquier in his fundamental book </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Le système d’information durable - la refonte du SI avec SOA</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">The three main entities constituting the ideal information system are </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">master data management</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">MDM</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">), </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">business rules management system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">BRMS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">), and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">business process modeling</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1"> (we are going to explain these in more detail shortly). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">The next few sections will explain them one by one, and this chapter will end with an analysis of how this utopic system could be created in reality and what would </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">prevent this.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">The concept of an ideal IT system</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Before we detail the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker270"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1"> different parts of such an ideal system, I will explain a bit more about the usefulness of such a model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">When things are a bit clearer about the goal we want to reach, we will detail the different parts of the concept and try to make them </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">more concrete.</span></span><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">The use for an ideal structure</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">“Ideal” or “utopic” are</span><a id="_idIndexMarker271"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1"> terms that engineers generally have a strange relationship with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Though much of their thinking is done inside hypothetical contexts to make an advance in theory, they know that practice will always be quite a long shot from the theory and, depending on how they are versed between theory and practice, engineers can easily fall into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">many traps:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Staying purely in theory risks that their thinking is never applied in the real world, which ends up in a loss of time and also an impossibility of truly knowing the value of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">their work.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Not having enough theoretical background to make advances in their field; remaining purely in the practice of the job might help refine some areas but seldom bring strong, domain-changing, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">revolutionary ideas.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">The worst of all: switching between the two but never making real links between them that enrich the practice from the theory and confirm the theory from the practice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">This capacity of bringing the two together is, in my opinion, what makes the best engineering structures, may they be companies or even countries that teach and organize this capacity at the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">highest level.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">This is why there is a place in such a book, otherwise extremely turned toward practices with lots of returns on experience from many real-world information systems, for a bit of theory and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">ideal thinking</span><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">The origin of the design</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">The structure of an</span><a id="_idIndexMarker272"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1"> ideal system, as we are going to describe here, was first coined in a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Le système d’information durable - la refonte du SI avec SOA</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">, by Dominique Vauquier, one of the best-known enterprise architects in France, and proponent of the PRAXEME method. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">I was lucky enough to receive training more than 10 years ago and its explanations were so clear that I immediately bought his books, which quickly became some of my references for my consulting work in information </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">system industrialization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">The principles</span><a id="_idIndexMarker273"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1"> behind this idea were that, knowing lots of information systems, it was possible to describe a kind of meta-system that would encompass all the necessary features with only a few generic modules that could be customized to implement the business-related aspects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">Each of these three modules would be extremely general and not related at all to any particular business, which explains why there is so little in the whole system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">These three areas are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">as follows:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">Storing data and making it available (roughly speaking, this is what gets done </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">by databases)</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Executing business rules to make decisions (this would be where software applications consuming the data come into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">the game)</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Implementing complex processes by orchestrating many small tasks (though very approximative, this is what making applications work together </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">is about)</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Dominique Vauquier was indeed able to point to any business feature as a composition of these three different technical functions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">After working with many industrial information systems in small and large companies, he considered that the three modules together would be able to handle every imaginable feature of any given business domain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.3">Though this is not a structure that has been largely used for now, it may be just a very anticipated glimpse at what would become industrialized and well-controlled information systems a few decades from now. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.4">At least, this is – from my humble point of view – the best candidate for such a structure with so </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">much ahead-thinki</span><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">ng.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">Using a vision to define a target</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Why</span><a id="_idIndexMarker274"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1"> should we talk about an architecture that is so futuristic and that we do not have any proof of its capability to be applied in practice? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">Can this lead to overthinking or over-engineering? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">If you ask yourself these questions, you are very right to do so, and this chapter is not about pushing you to use this tool for your next information </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">system architecture.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Just like any pattern or architecture tool, it is principally there to give you some ideas and, if some parts of it are fit for your system, it will be great that it helps you go forward and accelerate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">your thinking.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">But having</span><a id="_idIndexMarker275"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1"> an “ideal” or “utopic” vision can also be helpful to give a global orientation to your realization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">Remember the metaphor of Agile development, where we do not shoot an arrow but walk with it toward the target and plant the arrow with our hands when the target is reached? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">Well, to do so, we agreed that we need to know what the target is like to find and reach it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">And sometimes, the target shape can be hard to imagine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">Sure, a business-oriented mind will give you the best idea and you should remain functionally-focused. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.6">But what happens if the business ideas are quite blurry? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.7">Maybe a “soft,” adaptable information system would allow you to start working while things get a little clearer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.8">Starting building the system will even help the business owners think better about what they want. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.9">And if you have an “ideal” system that can very quickly adapt to their minds constructing the business idea, it may be the kind of system you need for such </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">a project.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Of course, there will be an extra cost of being completely generic (in performance but also time for initial setup), but if this is the kind of situation you are in, the capacity to adapt to a moving business target by simply customizing parameters of the information system may largely overcome these drawbacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">And nothing prevents you, once the business vision is settled, from re-implementing some now-stable parts with specific, optimized bits of code, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">where needed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Now that the vision is clear, we are going to dive deeper into the three parts that constitute this ideal IT system, namely the data management module, the rules management module, and, finally, the process </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">management mo</span><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">dule.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Data management in the ideal system</span></h1>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">MDM</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker276"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">the very first </span><a id="_idIndexMarker277"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">part of the ideal system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.2">Before talking</span><a id="_idIndexMarker278"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1"> about how the data is processed and used, it is logical to explain what form the data will take and how it will be managed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">This is why we will explain the concept of MDM in a utopic system before discussing BRMS </span><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">and BPM.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Data is the blood of information systems</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Data is the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker279"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">most important component of any information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">Some people may even think they are purely about data since the very term “data” has been so hyped in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">past decade.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">Admittedly, it is hard to imagine an information system without at least one database to store the data, since it would mean there is no knowledge of any business event that stays there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">It is possible to imagine some pieces of information that are completely transient and not stored, but a whole system made of such particular cases sounds impossible </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">to fathom.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">This means that data should be taken care of first and foremost, and this is what the first module of the ideal generic information system is about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">The feature is called MDM. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">The term </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">master</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">, in this case, refers to the most important data in a system, those used by most of the participants in the system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">But in this particular case of a utopic system, every single piece of data would be considered as such and placed in a single module that deals with this responsibility </span><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">of “MDM.”</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">Data as the 21st-century oil – really?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">Before we dive</span><a id="_idIndexMarker280"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1"> a bit more into what would be such a module, a small additional note on the importance of data: you may heard the expression “oil of the 21st century” regarding data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">This is to stress the point that data has become such an important part of commercial organizations nowadays that it can be compared to oil, which has brought a huge part of the industry improvements in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">20th century.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Data is used by many industrial companies to follow their machines, optimize production, and relate it to selling and stocks, in short virtualizing the industrial process in a “digital twin” to better control it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">But for some industries, data may even be the raw material itself, and lots of digital-native companies nowadays make their money purely out of data collection, refining, and reselling, particularly for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">advertisement activities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">Oil exploitation, which has happened since the 20th century, has allowed industrial production to be accelerated dramatically in almost every domain (heavy industries, trains, fertilizers, agriculture machinery, and so on) but also brought to life many of the biggest companies to exploit and produce oil itself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">This comparison is fair, although care should be taken in keeping a few important differences </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">in mind.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">First, the equivalent of the oil-cracking refinery column has not been invented yet for data, or at least not in its standard form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">Sure, some business intelligence tools and big data </span><a id="_idIndexMarker281"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">approaches can help in some cases, but the rate of failure of data projects (estimated between 70 and 80%, depending on the studies) shows that we are still far from industrialization in oil-refinery plants. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">To this day, data remains partly, for most companies, such as oil, was for land owners at the end of the 19th century: pollution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">Sure, there is value in it, but it is completely out of exploitation, and there is no standard way of extracting </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">this value.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">Let’s also not forget that data remains based on actual oil: data centers consume a huge amount of energy (soon, 8% of the energy on the planet will be taken for digital uses, which is more than air travel and will soon reach car transportation). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">And though some data center owners pretend to use renewable energies (but just buy compensating activities, which does not reduce global oil consumption), most of them are still heavily dependent on oil for energy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">In addition, the production of servers and network hardware, the transportation used for them, and the exploitation functions are large consumers of energy and, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">eventually, oil.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">Therefore, it is very important to keep in mind that data may indeed become the oil of the next century, but we are in this situation at the moment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">The data management approach described in this chapter may help you reach it, particularly by using governance to improve data quality, which remains the number-one cause hindering </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">data ex</span><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">ploitation.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">A really “know it all” system</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">I will not go into too</span><a id="_idIndexMarker282"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1"> much detail in this chapter since MDM is the subject of a dedicated chapter later in this book, and it will be explained together with a real example, which will hopefully make everything easier. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.2">For</span><a id="_idIndexMarker283"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1"> now, I will just propose a comparison of the MDM with a “know-it-all all” system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">Indeed, a well-made MDM will not only know the state of entities at present but will know the whole story of each entity and remember their different states and modifications, from cradle (creation) to grave (archiving or deletion). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.3">Due to this, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">persistence</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1"> is the main responsibility of an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">MDM module.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">However, there are some </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">other responsibilities:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">Ease of research</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">: This goes with persistence because keeping data without making it available afterward would not make much sense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">This particular responsibility might be delegated in its implementation, typically when the MDM application uses an indexation engine, for example (full-text search is a complicated matter that justifies cutting a responsibility into several more atomic ones and trusting dedicated modules </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">with each).</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">Origin of reporting /business intelligence</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">: Just like data search, reporting is an important responsibility that MDM modules can trust other implementations with, for example, a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">data lake.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">Ability to handle multiple versions of entities</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">: As explained previously, a true MDM should know </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">every</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1"> version of a data entity, not only its “latest” state (the quotes are there to stress the point that this “latest” concept is something of a pain in lots of systems, particularly when they are distributed, because it depends on the consistency of data, and thus transactions, optimistic/pessimistic locks, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">so on).</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">CQRS is too big of a subject for it to be treated in this book together with all the other subjects we have to explain, but it perfectly fits the separation of responsibilities of an MDM module, and I strongly encourage you to use this approach when creating MDM implementations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.2">The example we’ll cover in the next few parts of this book will use a CQRS approach, though in a very limited and simplified implementation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.3">Again, this is an edition choice as adding a full Kafka engine would have made it difficult to concentrate on the application itself and would get us too far from the subje</span><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">ct of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">this book.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">In IT, there is a strong equivalence to data as clean data is a great product that will allow precise reporting on the business activity, quick insights on problems that may appear, and overall better control of the company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.2">Discuss this with anybody in the industry and everyone will agree that the quality of data is of paramount importance… Yet, it is estimated that more than half of the job of a data scientist is to clean data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.3">I have seen several companies where this proportion dangerously increases to around 80%. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.4">I say “dangerously” for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">many reasons:</span></span></p>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">It is also generally a waste of time as good data scientists will generally leave the job in the next 6 months if they have to work more on cleaning and assembling the data than “making </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">it talk”</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">Finally, it shows a problem up the pipe because the IT system that sends this dirty data has not been correctly designed, which means that there are good chances that these reporting issues are not the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">only ones</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">There will </span><a id="_idIndexMarker290"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">almost always be an internal designation of the software application that stores the main entities of an organization, for example, products. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">Most of the time, people will call this by the name of the technology – for example, the “products database” or the “products Excel file” – but this is a bad habit as it couples the functional concept with a technical, software, concept. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.3">Not only can these two evolve separately (and the “products file” becomes the “products database”) but they should be able to do so as much as possible, and thus be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">kept separate.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">The “products list” is already a bit better from this point of view, but my favorite (because it is very close to an equivalent word in French, which is my native language) is to call this a product “referential.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">This name bears the important notion of it assuming a status of reference for</span><a id="_idIndexMarker291"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1"> the data contained within while being also possible to see it as a referential in space, which comes back to the idea of a map of the information system, just like we would have a geographical map, with coordinates inside </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">a referential.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">Important note</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">The naming could be much worse, as I already cited anecdotally in </span><a href="B21293_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor069"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">Chapter 3</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">, with one of my customers calling the article’s referential simply “Serge’s file.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">This led to a lot of confusion as it was hiding the uttermost importance of keeping this file up-to-date, which was not even Serge’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">job officially!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">Most of the time, so-called “referentials” are dedicated to a single type of entity (products, sales, customers, and so on) The idea of the utopic system described in this chapter is to have a single piece of software for any type of entity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">We won’t dive too deep into the utopia in the rest of this book and will maintain a more standard approach with one implementation of referential for a given business domain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.3">This also allows us to adopt the best technology for each case (the “best of bread” approach), rather than a “one size fits all” approach, which is interesting in theory but extremely complex to make wo</span><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">rk in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">real world.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">Love it or hate it, Excel </span><a id="_idIndexMarker292"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">remains the simplest MDM you can have, and in many small companies, a well-organized process using Excel can already go a long way, provided you have removed the most important shortcomings of a good organization (a centralized file shared with rights for different users rather than copies everywhere, strict organization of data quality, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">so on).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">Of course, there will be a level of complexity that will necessitate a dedicated implementation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">That sounds crazy, but there are very few software applications dedicated to MDM. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.3">There is an offer from Microsoft based on SQL Server called Master Data Services, but its use sounds very limited, at least in my area of knowledge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.4">Following a discussion with Microsoft, the product is indeed abandoned, and the successor is a partner product </span><a id="_idIndexMarker293"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">Profisee</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1"> working together </span><a id="_idIndexMarker294"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">with </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Microsoft Purview</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1"> to provide data governance functions (</span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/profisee-master-data-management-purview"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/profisee-master-data-management-purview</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">Semarchy (</span><a href="https://www.semarchy.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">https://www.semarchy.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">) sounds like a new and interesting approach to integrated MDM but I have not given it a sufficient try to recommend </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">it yet.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">I have seen some companies using headless CMS systems such as Strapi, Sanity, Cockpit, Prisma, and others to create backends that can serve as entry-level MDM. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.2">But this generally lacks a good data versioning system and implementation of governance remains the job of the integrator. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.3">All in all, this is a very technology-based approach and, as stated previously, an MDM is much more than simply </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">storing data.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">This is roughly</span><a id="_idIndexMarker295"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1"> it for an off-the-shelf approach, and admittedly this does not go a long way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.2">Every correct implementation of an MDM I have seen to this day has been a dedicated development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.3">Some business applications, such as ERP, sometimes have a good referential for products or customers, but most of them miss the alignment </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">on business.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">Tip</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">It may sound logical that an ERP may not be business-aligned as it tries to be generic to many business domains. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">Nonetheless, when you see a top five ERP system proposing two separate domains for customers and suppliers, ignoring the possible duplication of data for most of the existing companies, this shows that the problem is not only the variety of businesses, but the very approach of these ERP companies, which consider that modeling the business is 100% the customer’s responsibility, whereas it should be a shared responsibility based on written, forward-compatible, standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.3">But this would go against vendor lock-in, which is not in their interest, and this is why the only way forward is for the customers to choose an implementation that accepts standards for business entity representations, including developing these standards in the (rare) cases where they do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">not exist.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">What remains – and represents the vast majority of running MDM systems – are dedicated applications coupled with a database (and sometimes an indexation engine, and even a data lake, as explained previously). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.2">They are custom-developed for a given business use by internal IT or external software companies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.3">This is a huge waste of time and money if you think globally as many companies have needs that are extremely close to each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.4">However, this is just how it is for now due to the lack of business standards used in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">software industry.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">Now for the second part of the ideal system: after talking about data, we need t</span><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">o discuss </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">business rules.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">If data </span><a id="_idIndexMarker298"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">is the blood of the information system, business rules are its nervous and muscular networks: they use the blood to realize some activities in a given way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.2">A business rule in our metaphor could be that “if you feel a burning sensation on your finger, the arm must retract.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.3">This rule is implemented in our spinal reflex system, which uses the sensors in its fingers to send the information/data through the nerves, resulting in the muscles from the concerned arm being unable to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">be controlled.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">In IT, the implementation of business rules is mostly what are called applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.2">This is generally where business rules are contained. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.3">In our example, there must be some code somewhere in the ERP that alerts the package preparation system that the customer has not passed the condition of having a verified way of payment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.4">The reaction of the packaging system may be that this order will not be processed, or maybe that it will be processed in advance but the resulting physical package will be retained before delivery. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.5">The actual implementation is the responsibility of each module, but the business rule remains the same: “No customer delivered with their orders so long as we have not verified we can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">get paid,”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">Business </span><a id="_idIndexMarker299"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">rules also contain all the calculations, from the most complex to the most mundane, that you will perform in the information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">Let me go back on this because there is something to say about the right separation of responsibility: </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">no client (GUI or application calling an API) should deal with business rules, which always have to be implemented server-side</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">This is certainly something that you know about and sounds logical: after all, it is obvious that such important bits of functional reasoning must be centralized to ensure that they are applied everywhere the same way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.3">But look at any client for a few minutes and you will find loads of functional decisions that are made locally, sometimes with the best reasoning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.4">For example, think about calculating a net amount from the gross amount and the VAT rate. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.5">Sure, the VAT rate does not change very often in an application’s lifetime, and the way the calculation is made is itself very stable, so there should not be any big issue with trusting the client to do this computing, and we are getting better performance since we avoid a roundtrip to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">a server.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">Alright, but you can always imagine ways that the business rule is going to change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">As already imagined, the VAT rate can change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.3">Also, if we are talking about net amount calculation for a multi-line order, you must handle multiple VAT rates in a single entity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.4">The question boils down to risk management: if you know that you will never hit these particular cases, that’s alright. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.5">If you doubt the possibility they will appear in the future, you should first ask your product owners about it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.6">If they are not sure about it, you will have to compare the costs of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">different approaches:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">You can hard-code the business rule in all clients and hope it doesn’t evolve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">If there are not that many of them and you can easily upgrade them, no </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">big deal.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">You can prepare for a possible change by making the rate a parameter of the applications you use (when they support it); this will already be better easier in case of adjustment, without a huge </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">upfront cost.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">If you foresee changes in the business rules in the coming years and you know adjusting the software will be complicated, maybe you should put the rule in a server-side, centralized, application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">Sure, it will be a bit slower, but client-side cache can help and you will </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">be future-proof.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">If you are in a situation where lots of business changes are going to happen, and many business rules are going to be dealt with, then you’ll reach the point where investing in a centralized piece of software dedicated to managing your business rules </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">makes sense.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">How would</span><a id="_idIndexMarker302"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1"> you go about implementing a BRMS? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.2">It may make you smile but, again, Excel is the simplest implementation for a BRMS, most of the time without people knowing it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.3">One accountant will certainly tell you (if you ask) that they do not use any BRMS for their job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.4">But at the same time, they will boast about a hand-crafted Excel workbook with all the calculations (and thus business rules, whether regulatory or company-wise) they need in their day-to-day job as well as for the monthly closing period. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.5">What is this if not a BRMS? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.6">In fact, due to the relatively rare use of a “true” dedicated BRMS, it simply happens that business rules are contained in Excel files for most </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">small companies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">Within larger companies, there are more business-line applications, such as ERP, or even bespoke software when the companies have internal software development capacity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">In this case, the proportion of business rules integrated into the application rises, but this is not necessarily </span><a id="_idIndexMarker303"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">for the best. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.2">Why do lots of business-oriented people love Excel spreadsheets despite their shortcomings? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.3">Simply because they have full control over it and do not depend on the IT department to make changes, add functions, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.4">Start implementing a business rule inside some application and the coupling problem immediately </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">pops up:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">Is it possible to change the rule without recompiling, testing, and deploying the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">application again?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">If the rules can be customized, is it possible to do so via a functional operator or do you need the IT to implement the change (or in the best case, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">train them)?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">How do we deal with rules that must change at a particular date and time (for example January 1 at midnight for lots of accounting-related or business-wide </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">reporting rules)?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">Is it possible to have two concurrent versions of the business rule, or are we obliged to stop the software at the end of the year to make sure nothing is done before somebody changes the rule at the beginning of the new year (do not laugh: it happens </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">very often…)?</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">Despite these potential problems, implementing business rules in dedicated business applications is already a nice step forward, particularly if this is done server-side, preferably as the implementation of a well-documented, contract-first API. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">This solution is less prone to errors than Excel spreadsheets, which might be disseminated across the organization with different implementations of rules, resulting in a mess. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.3">It also tends to provide a first level of governance of the business rules since different services are responsible for “their” software applications, and thus for the business rules implemented (or customized) </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">in them.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">Still, these implementations are not representative of a BRMS in the sense of our utopic system, namely a unique one that would contain all the business rules of the company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">And if you want to go all the way to a future-proof information system, you will rather use something such as Drools (an open source package, declined in JBoss Rules by Red Hat) or IBM Operational Decision Manager. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.3">These pieces of software will generally provide the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">following features:</span></span></p>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">Some of them provide a graphical editor for non-technical people to be able to adjust rules by themselves. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.2">Though editors claim anyone can use them, they remain quite technical and require </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">some training.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">Together with this, a sandbox is very useful for people to test their business rules adjustments before putting them </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">into production.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">In this chapter, we presented what could be an ideal information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.2">We talked about all the problems that can arise in software industrial deployments, particularly concerning their evolution, so it was quite logical to show not only punctual solutions but also how the problem could be addressed globally. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.3">Of course, a fair part of this approach remains utopic, but this exercise is interesting in the fact that it shows that only three modules, if very well built, can serve any business needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.4">The separation between data, business rules, and business processes is something that should be kept in mind even if the information system you work with is far from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">being ideal.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">This chapter was quite conceptual, but this concludes the first part of this book, which was meant to cover a lot of theoretical background. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">The next part of this book will cover more practical methods for architecture and, to be fully articulated between theory and practice (which is the main premise of this book), the third part will provide source code to show you how to implement the concepts and approaches of sound architecture that we have talked about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.3">In particular, the three main modules that have been explained here will be shown in a sample application with a limited functional perimeter, but with all the sophistication needed to grow to a full-fledged information system </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">if needed:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">The MDM will be based on a NoSQL database, with a back office server in ASP.NET that exposes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">API-designed contract-first</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">A separate BRMS will be used for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">authorization management</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">A BPM approach will be held to show how to make processes adjustable, with a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">low-code implementation</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">To summarize, in the next seven chapters, we will use battle-hardened methods to design the sample application by using examples that apply to parts of the use cases we will need. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.2">This, in the following five chapters, will be used to implement the sample application, module by module. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.3">Finally, the last three chapters will be about deploying and adjusting this sample application, just like if it were in production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.4">As time passes by, adjustments need to be made to keep it aligned with the functional </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">business needs.</span></span></p>
