- en: Dynamics NAV is an **Enterprise Resource Planning** (**ERP**) system targeted
    at small- and medium-sized companies. An ERP is a system, a software, which integrates
    internal and external management information across an entire organization. If
    you search the Internet, you will find plenty of documentation, web forums, and
    all kinds of information covering Dynamics NAV from many technical points of view,
    but you will find little or nothing covering Dynamics NAV from a functional point
    of view, meant for end users. Thousands of users from all around the world who
    use Dynamics NAV as their main tool for daily work complain that they cannot find
    information about what they need from the system. And they are right.

- en: This book is written for them, after the experience of training many end users
    on each implementation we have worked on. We have found out that most users do
    not care about system configuration; they just want to know how the system works.
    They contact Dynamics NAV consultants to set up when needed. But in the little
    end user documentation they find, each topic starts with a full setup introduction
    that confuses readers and possibly even discourages them from reading.

- en: In this book, we have changed the established structure of official manuals.
    Instead, we have used a logical structure that makes it easy to read and very
    easy to understand; this is how we teach Dynamics NAV in our training courses,
    and this is how people tell us they have learned and understood the application.

- en: Don't think this book is meant only for financers and accountants; this book
    is also meant for Dynamics NAV consultants and developers. You need complete functional
    knowledge of Dynamics NAV to become an expert, and this book can help you with
    it.

    behind the book is that you learn enough to be able to keep learning on your own.
    Every single field in every single table can hide a mini functionality that can
    help you in your work.

    and Business Intelligence*, discusses the tools that can help you with the analysis,

    Schedules and Analysis view are features that allow users to create their own
    reports. You can also use the Business Intelligence tools included in Excel by

    Foretelling - Budgeting and Cash Flow Management*, explains how accounting rules
    are based on fait accomplis, but companies need to anticipate and predict events.

    be used to set up goals and measure performance. The cash flow management functionality
    is meant to help companies to predict future cash needs.'

    can translate transactions into accountancy language according to your company''s
    rules.'
