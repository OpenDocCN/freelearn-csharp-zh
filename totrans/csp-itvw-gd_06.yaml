    and they can be more memory-efficient since there’s no overhead associated with
    storing additional metadata or maintaining unused capacity, which is often the
    case with lists. Arrays are particularly suitable when the number of items is
    known upfront and remains constant, as they cannot dynamically resize as lists
    can.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`LinkedList<T>` is a doubly linked list, where each node has references to
    the previous and next nodes. In contrast, `List<T>` is a dynamic array. The fundamental
    difference lies in how the data is stored and how it can be modified. `LinkedList<T>`
    is optimal for insertion and deletion operations in the middle of the list, given
    its node-based structure, which allows for efficient node addition or removal
    without shifting other elements. Conversely, `List<T>` is efficient for indexed
    access due to its array-backed nature.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of a collection, `LinkedList<T>` can be more efficient. However, if the primary
    operations involve indexed access or if the collection size remains relatively
    static, `List<T>` might be a better choice.

    keys are unique. This data structure allows fast lookups, insertions, and deletions
    based on keys. Typical scenarios for its use include storing configuration settings,
    caching data, and scenarios where you need to quickly retrieve a value associated

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Immutable collections in C# are collections that cannot be modified after they
    are created. Instead of modifying them directly, any operation that would change
    the collection returns a new instance of the collection with the desired changes.
    Advantages of using immutable collections include thread safety (since there’s
    no risk of another thread modifying the collection unexpectedly) and the assurance
    that the data remains unchanged throughout its life cycle. On the downside, they
    can be less performant than mutable counterparts, especially when frequent modifications
    are needed, as each modification results in a new collection being created. This
    can also lead to increased memory usage.

    block?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you use `throw` without any argument, you’re essentially rethrowing the
    current exception, preserving the original stack trace. This allows for easier
    debugging as you maintain the information about where the exception was originally
    thrown. On the other hand, when you use `throw ex`, you reset the stack trace
    to the current `catch` block, potentially losing valuable information about where
    and how the exception originated. Therefore, in general, it’s recommended to use
    `throw` by itself within a `catch` block if you intend to rethrow the caught exception.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An **inner exception** refers to a previous exception that led to the current
    exception being thrown. It’s especially useful when the current exception arises
    as a result of another exception. By examining the inner exception, developers
    can trace back to the root cause of a problem, providing a clearer picture of
    the sequence of events leading up to the final exception. This can be invaluable
    during debugging, as it helps pinpoint the primary source of the issue and, potentially,
    cascading failures that led to the current state. When throwing a custom exception,
    you can include the original exception as the inner exception, preserving this
    chain of causality.

    to the point where an exception was thrown. It essentially shows the hierarchy
    of method calls that the application went through before encountering the exception.
    This can be instrumental for developers as it offers insights into the execution
    flow and context in which the exception occurred. By analyzing the stack trace,
    developers can often pinpoint the exact location and reason for the exception,

    use the `ContinueWith` method on a task to handle exceptions, or use the `await`

    it might throw.
  prefs: []

- en: The distinction between `async void` and `async Task` methods is crucial when
    it comes to exception handling. `async void` methods don’t return a task, so exceptions
    thrown from such methods get thrown directly into the thread pool. This can lead
    to unobserved exceptions which, at best, could crash the application if not caught,
    and at worst, might silently fail without any indication to the developer. `async
    Task`, on the other hand, returns a task that encapsulates the operation, and
    exceptions can be observed and handled by awaiting the task or inspecting its
    result.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If one of the event subscribers throws an exception during its execution, the
    subsequent subscribers in the invocation list won’t be executed. This means that
    other subscribers might miss the event notification. To mitigate this, one can
    invoke each delegate in the event’s invocation list separately, wrapped in a `try`-`catch`
    block. This ensures that an exception in one subscriber does not prevent the others
    from being invoked. Handling exceptions appropriately also ensures that the main

    one or more methods, events are a mechanism that allows a class to notify other
    classes or objects when something of interest occurs. Events use delegates behind
    the scenes to maintain a list of subscribers and to specify the signature of methods
    that can handle the event. In essence, events encapsulate delegates, adding an
    extra layer of protection and ensuring that only the owning class can raise an

    memory management and garbage collection in C#?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The stack is used for storing local variables, method execution details, and
    controlling program flow. It operates in a LIFO manner, and memory is automatically
    reclaimed when the method or block of code exits. The heap, on the other hand,
    is used for storing dynamically allocated memory such as objects. Memory on the
    heap is managed by the GC in C#. Objects in the heap exist until the GC determines
    that they are no longer reachable and reclaims the memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How does .NET recognize that an object has no active references and is ready
    for garbage collection?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: .NET uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm for garbage collection. Initially, all
    objects on the heap are considered *unreachable*. Starting with root objects (for
    example, global and static objects, local variables on the stack, and CPU registers),
    the GC traces and marks each object that is accessible. After the marking phase,
    any object that remains unmarked is considered **garbage** and is a candidate
    for collection. These unreachable objects are then swept or collected, freeing
    up the memory they occupied.

    even though they are no longer needed or accessible. While the GC is designed
    to automatically reclaim memory occupied by unreachable objects, it can’t free
    objects that still have active references. Therefore, even if an object is no
    longer in use but still has references pointing to it (for example, due to event
    handlers or static collections), it will not be collected, leading to memory leaks.

    maintain a cache or temporary reference to an object but don’t want that reference
    to be the sole reason the object remains in memory. When the only existing references
    to an object are weak references, the object becomes eligible for garbage collection.
    By using the `WeakReference` class in .NET, you can access the target object if
    it’s still in memory, but you don’t prevent the GC from collecting it when necessary.

    and is not collected by the GC until the method call. This can be useful for preventing
    premature garbage collection, especially for objects with significant finalization

    cycle, when the object is detected as unreachable, its finalizer is called. The
    object is then moved to a list of finalized objects. Only in a subsequent garbage
    collection cycle is the object actually reclaimed. This means objects with finalizers
    stay in memory longer, which can potentially lead to increased memory usage if
    not managed correctly.

    and likely to be short-lived are placed in the younger generation (Gen 0). The
    idea is that it’s more efficient to collect from this generation (Gen 0) frequently,
    as many objects will become unreachable quickly. When garbage collection occurs
    for this generation, only a subset of the heap (the younger generation) is considered,
    making the process faster. Objects that survive multiple collections are promoted
