I have built mobile applications in Java, objective-C, Swift (2 and 3), and C# across all mobile platforms. I’ve even built entire servers for my mobile applications.</p><p>I'm not standing here to brag, or to say that I'm an expert. But I do believe that I have encountered a ton of problems, and built solutions that a lot of mobile developers will require.</p><p>My latest work has been around building cross-platform solutions with Xamarin using both native and Xamarin.Forms. I have spent a lot of time narrowing down, what I believe are the best approaches in building any cross-platform mobile application. Building good architecture, structure, and a smooth user experience, whilst sharing as much code as possible.</p><p>Enjoy.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1.  Building a Gallery Application">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Building a Gallery Application</em>, provides you a walkthrough for native development with Xamarin by building an iOS and Android application that will read from your local gallery files and display them into a UITableView and ListView.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building a SpeechTalk Application">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Build a SpeechTalk Application</em>, provides you a walkthrough of Xamarin.Forms development by building an iOS, Android and Windows Phone application that will use platform speech services to talk text typed into a text field.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Building a GPS Locator Application">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Building a GPS Locator Application</em>, shows you how to build a Xamarin.Forms application that integrates native GPS location services and Google Maps APIs. We will cover more content on IoC containers, the Xamarin.Forms.Maps library, and techniques for C# async and background tasks.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4.  Building an Audio Player Application">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Building an Audio Player Application</em>, in this chapter, we will integrate native audio functions for processing a sound file using the AVFramework in iOS, and MediaPlayer framework in Android.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Building a Stocklist Application">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Building a Stocklist Application</em>, in this chapter we look at detailing our XAML interfaces using CustomRenderers, Styles, and ControlTemplates. We also build a simple web service and setup a JSON feed for our mobile application.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Building a Chat Application">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Building a Chat Application</em>, in this chapter our user interface will move away from MVVM design and follow a new paradigm called MVP (Model-View-Presenter). We take another step further into the backend and set up a SignalR hub and client to simulate a chat service, where data will be sent between the server and clients instantly as the messages become available. Another key topic of focus is the project architecture, spending time on separating the project into modules, and creating a nicely tiered structure that will maximize code sharing across different platforms.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7.  Building a File Storage Application">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Building a File Storage Application</em>, in this chapter we walk through more development using Xamarin.Forms. We look at Behaviors and their use with user interfaces. We also build a custom layout using the Layout &lt;View&gt; framework and build our first SQLite database for storing text files.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Building a Camera Application">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Building a Camera Application</em>, our last chapter, will introduce Effects and Triggers. We learn how to apply them to user interfaces and use them with Styles. We also build multiple complex CustomRenderers for native platform cameras, tinting images and receiving touch events.</p></div></div>
