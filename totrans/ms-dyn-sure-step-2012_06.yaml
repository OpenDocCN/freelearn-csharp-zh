- en: Quality management practices, including quality control and quality assurance,
    are essential aspects of the solution-delivery process to ensure that the solution
    being developed is in line with the expectations of the customer. *Dr. W. Edwards
    Deming* was one of the pioneers of the quality revolution, first in Japan, then
    in the United States, and then the rest of the world. Dr. Deming's teachings and
    philosophies originated in manufacturing, but have been extended to several disciplines
    over time, and his works have been produced and reproduced via a number of books
    and articles. Dr. Deming emphasized how quality and efficiency can improve simultaneously,
    by creating "a consistency of purpose designed to drive the organization towards
    product and service improvement and continually and permanently improving the
    system."

  zh: 在项目类型中控制质量
- en: Within the Sure Step implementation project types, the execution of quality
    management is often emphasized and entrusted to senior roles like the project
    manager, solution architect, and tester. These roles assume leadership of the
    solution-delivery process, and as such it is seen as a natural extension of their
    roles to oversee the quality aspects of solution delivery. Accordingly, key activities
    in the **Program Management** and **Quality and Testing** cross phases are specifically
    called out to monitor the quality of the implementation, with the project manager,
    solution architect, and so on, as the *owners* of the execution of the deliverables.
    In the Program Management cross phase, key quality-focused activities include
    the documentation of **Conditions of Satisfaction** (**CoS**) and the execution
    of **Tollgate Reviews**. The Quality and Testing cross phase includes activities
    early in the delivery cycle to ensure that Quality Standards are established.
    Additionally, Monitoring and Testing activities are essential elements of this
    cross phase, with activities called out in each phase.

  zh: 在 Sure Step 实施项目类型中，质量管理的执行通常被强调并委托给高级角色，如项目经理、解决方案架构师和测试员。这些角色负责领导解决方案交付过程，因此监督解决方案交付的质量被视为他们角色的自然延伸。因此，**项目管理**和**质量和测试**跨阶段的关键活动被特别指出，以监控实施的质量，项目经理、解决方案架构师等作为可交付成果执行的*负责人*。在项目管理跨阶段，关键的质量关注活动包括**满意度条件**（**CoS**）的记录和**关卡评审**的执行。质量和测试跨阶段包括在交付周期早期确保建立质量标准的活动。此外，监控和测试活动是这个跨阶段的关键要素，每个阶段都有具体的活动。

- en: Conditions of Satisfaction are the measures of project success and the goals
    for the engagement that allow the teams to clearly determine success or failure
    of the project. The guidance in Sure Step calls for the elements of CoS to be
    identified at the outset of the engagement, and are noted within the **Project
    Charter** or in a similar project documentation. The project manager is responsible
    for working with the customer to ensure that this activity is executed, and also
    to ensure that the document is signed off by the customer, thereby denoting their
    acceptance.

  zh: 满意度条件是项目成功的衡量标准，以及允许团队明确确定项目成功或失败的合作目标。Sure Step 中的指南要求在合作开始时确定 CoS 的要素，并在**项目章程**或类似的项目文档中注明。项目经理负责与客户合作确保执行此活动，并确保客户签署文件，从而表示他们的接受。
- en: Another key component of quality control during the implementation is Tollgate
    Reviews. For the Waterfall project types, the executions of Tollgate Reviews are
    called out at the end of each phase. For the Agile project type, Tollgate Reviews
    take the form of the Sprint Post Mortem, which is executed at the end of each
    sprint cycle.

- en: Tollgate Reviews in the Waterfall project types assess the current health of
    the project by reviewing the key milestones achieved and key deliverables completed
    during the corresponding phase. Any project issues and risks are also identified,
    documented, and a course for mitigating them is established. This may include
    a project scope and change requests to be initiated, and an approval is requested
    from the customer. Any adjustments to the overall timeline of the project are
    also performed during this activity. Tollgate Reviews are also used to assess
    how the project is faring in terms of addressing the Conditions of Satisfaction
    identified by the customer.

- en: The need for such rigor in testing is evident from the examples noted here.
    However, if the reader concludes that the number of tests seems to be too much
    overhead for smaller engagements, they may consider combining tests where feasible.
    However, for large-scale engagements, which may have several hundred simple and
    complex requirements, this rigor is necessary; so the reader is strongly advised
    against taking any shortcuts that may pose unnecessary risks. Skipping the individual
    tests may lead to issues being detected downstream in the process. As any experienced
    consultant would tell you, it is better to test a smaller subset of the solution
    so as to isolate any potential issues. The alternative, which is more time consuming
    and laborious, is to test all the setups together to try to determine if the problem
    lies in a single subset of code, or is due to the intersection with another element
    of code. In that sense, you could draw a parallel to a manufacturing process.
    In multi-part manufacturing, it is critical to detect quality issues during the
    manufacture of the components. Waiting until assembly to discover parts that don't
    fit will likely shut down the assembly line and lead to expensive delays. Just
    as in the manufacturing process, testing the individual code components is important
    during the solution development, before the solution is tested as a whole.

- en: 'The Encarta dictionary definition of optimize is: enhance effectiveness of
    something, to make something function at its best or most effective, or use something
    to its best advantage. Optimization can mean different things depending on your
    point of view. In terms of a system, optimization could mean the process of improving
    the ease of use or response rate of the system. For a program, it could mean an
    attempt to reduce runtime, bandwidth, or memory requirements, while for computer
    code, optimization could entail improving the performance or efficiency of the
    compiled code. For a business process, optimization could mean improving the efficiency
    of that process, including reducing costs or the throughput time. For the optimization
    offerings in Sure Step, all these definitions apply to a certain extent.'

    Microsoft Dynamics solution? This is one area where the Technical Review services

    solution deployments. Leveraging the PGDR offering, these resources can work with
    experienced project managers to develop that skill set for future engagements.

    are lost to the competition. As such, the service provider should leverage the
    Health Check offerings to further their relationship with their customers. In
