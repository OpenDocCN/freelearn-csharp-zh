- en: Distributed systems are always hard to get complete success with. Lately, microservices
    are getting a considerable amount of attention. With Netflix and Spotify, microservice
    implementations have the become the biggest success stories in the industry. On
    the other hand, there are people who are of the opinion that microservices are
    nothing new or that they are only a rebranding of SOA.

    in the Microsoft ecosystem and, especially, by taking advantage of Azure and the
    .NET Core framework. This book tries to fill that void.

    and operating microservice architectures built with .NET Core 2.0\. This book
    discusses all cross-cutting concerns along with the microservices design. It also
    highlights some important aspects to consider while building and operating microservices
    through practical *How Tos* and best practices for security, monitoring, and scalability.
