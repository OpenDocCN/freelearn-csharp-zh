- en: Hi there, and welcome to the exciting and ever-evolving world of Extended Reality
    (XR) development! If you’re feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness about
    diving into XR development in Unity for the first time, you’re not alone.
  prefs: []

- en: But don’t worry – the primary goal of this book is to make XR development accessible
    to everyone, regardless of prior experience. We’ll use simple language, provide
    vivid examples, and guide you through every step, from making objects grabbable
    to writing scripts in C# and incorporating hand-tracking into your scenes. You
    won’t even need access to a VR headset or AR-compatible smartphone to follow along;
    you can test most of the projects using simulators on your laptop or PC, ensuring
    accessibility for all.

    hours trying to make a basic XR experience work. Now that we’ve gained extensive
    experience at notable companies such as Deutsche Telekom and academic institutions
    such as Fraunhofer IGD, we want to share our knowledge with you.

    in XR development or Unity to reaching an intermediate level in creating interactive
    XR applications for any domain. Its structure is also designed to help you easily
    access XR-related techniques to build outstanding XR applications, so you won’t
    need to constantly search online for answers, as we once did. Our goal is not
    to narrow your XR development expertise to specific use cases but to equip you
    with a wide array of tools so that you can bring any XR project to life, without
    limitations.

    serves as a general introduction to the topic of XR development in Unity. This
    chapter explains which approaches exist to bring VR, MR, and AR to life. Furthermore,
    Unity’s role in XR development is introduced. The main goal of this chapter is
    to provide a good baseline to start learning how to build XR applications.'

    Creation*, is aimed at those unfamiliar with Unity. It explains how to install
    Unity Hub and the Unity Editor and provides a step-by-step guide on how to create
    a basic scene in Unity. This chapter introduces fundamental concepts, from lighting
    and rendering to importing assets from the Unity Asset Store, equipping you with
    everything you need to know about the Unity Engine before diving into XR development.'

    experiences, it’s crucial to set the foundation right. This starts by cloning
    the project repository using Git LFS. Even if you plan to build all projects from
    the ground up, it’s highly recommended to clone the entire repository. There will
    undoubtedly be sections where cross-referencing your progress with the actual
    solution will prove beneficial.

- en: When working on virtual, augmented, and mixed reality projects in Unity, it’s
    common to handle large files – think 3D models, textures, audio clips, and more.
    Simply downloading a project might seem like a straightforward approach, but you
    may run into issues. The reason is rooted in how GitHub (and many other platforms)
    handle large files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s illustrate this with a simple analogy. Imagine you have a vast library
    of books. Instead of storing all these books at your home, which would take up
    enormous space, you get a reference card for each book. Whenever you want to read
    a particular book, you present the card at the library, and they provide the book
    for you.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Git **LFS**, which stands for Git **Large File Storage**, operates on a similar
    principle. Instead of saving bulky files directly within the repository, Git LFS
    maintains a tiny reference or “pointer.” The actual hefty files are stored elsewhere.
    Consequently, when you directly download a project without employing LFS, you
    only obtain these pointers, not the genuine files. To secure the entire content,
    you must clone the project with Git LFS.

    information about Extended Reality (XR) technologies and the Unity Engine. This
    part serves as a foundation for your journey in XR application development in
    the subsequent parts. Here, we will guide you through the process of installing
    Unity Hub and the Unity Editor, and we’ll introduce you to important concepts
    such as scene creation, asset downloading from Unity Asset Store, the various
    types of light sources available in Unity, and explanations of supported rendering
    types. No prior knowledge of Unity or XR technologies is required to follow along
    with this part. Instead, this part will equip you with all the necessary knowledge
    to start your hands-on XR development adventure.
