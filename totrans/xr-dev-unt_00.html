<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5">Preface</h1>
<p>Hi there, and welcome to the exciting and ever-evolving world of Extended Reality (XR) development! If you’re feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness about diving into XR development in Unity for the first time, you’re not alone.</p>
<p>But don’t worry – the primary goal of this book is to make XR development accessible to everyone, regardless of prior experience. We’ll use simple language, provide vivid examples, and guide you through every step, from making objects grabbable to writing scripts in C# and incorporating hand-tracking into your scenes. You won’t even need access to a VR headset or AR-compatible smartphone to follow along; you can test most of the projects using simulators on your laptop or PC, ensuring accessibility for all.</p>
<p>In our own XR development journey, we’ve faced the frustration of spending endless hours trying to make a basic XR experience work. Now that we’ve gained extensive experience at notable companies such as Deutsche Telekom and academic institutions such as Fraunhofer IGD, we want to share our knowledge with you.</p>
<p>This book is not only a complete guide that will take you from being a novice in XR development or Unity to reaching an intermediate level in creating interactive XR applications for any domain. Its structure is also designed to help you easily access XR-related techniques to build outstanding XR applications, so you won’t need to constantly search online for answers, as we once did. Our goal is not to narrow your XR development expertise to specific use cases but to equip you with a wide array of tools so that you can bring any XR project to life, without limitations.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to start on this journey with you!</p>

<p>As you venture into creating immersive virtual, augmented, and mixed reality experiences, it’s crucial to set the foundation right. This starts by cloning the project repository using Git LFS. Even if you plan to build all projects from the ground up, it’s highly recommended to clone the entire repository. There will undoubtedly be sections where cross-referencing your progress with the actual solution will prove beneficial.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Attention</p>
<p class="callout">Do not simply download the repository in a ZIP format. Doing so will most likely result in errors upon opening. The correct approach is to clone it using Git LFS.</p>
<p>When working on virtual, augmented, and mixed reality projects in Unity, it’s common to handle large files – think 3D models, textures, audio clips, and more. Simply downloading a project might seem like a straightforward approach, but you may run into issues. The reason is rooted in how GitHub (and many other platforms) handle large files.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this with a simple analogy. Imagine you have a vast library of books. Instead of storing all these books at your home, which would take up enormous space, you get a reference card for each book. Whenever you want to read a particular book, you present the card at the library, and they provide the book for you.</p>
<p>Git <strong class="bold">LFS</strong>, which stands for Git <strong class="bold">Large File Storage</strong>, operates on a similar principle. Instead of saving bulky files directly within the repository, Git LFS maintains a tiny reference or “pointer.” The actual hefty files are stored elsewhere. Consequently, when you directly download a project without employing LFS, you only obtain these pointers, not the genuine files. To secure the entire content, you must clone the project with Git LFS.</p>
<p>The installation process for Git LFS and cloning our repository is very straightforward. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>brew install git</code> in your Terminal if you have Homebrew. For Linux, use your package manager, such as<em class="italic"> </em><code>sudo apt-get install git</code> for Debian-based distributions.</li>
<li><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code>. Configure your email with <code>git config --global </code><code>user.email "youremail@example.com"</code>.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Install Git LFS</strong>: Visit the official Git LFS website (<a href="https://git-lfs.com/">https://git-lfs.com/</a>) and follow their installation instructions.</li>
<li><code>git lfs install</code>. This sets up Git LFS for your user account.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Sign up for GitHub</strong>: If you haven’t already, create a free account on GitHub (<a href="https://git-lfs.com/">https://git-lfs.com/</a>).</li>
<li><code>git clone </code><code>https://github.com/PacktPublishing/XR-Development-with-Unity.git</code> command.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it! You’re now ready to work with the Git repository and Git LFS to manage large files.</p>
