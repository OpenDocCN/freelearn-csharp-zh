    times, there are many challenges while creating even a basic business solution.
    You often find yourself implementing standard non-business requirements and digging
    into infrastructure problems rather than implementing your business code, which
    is the actual valuable part of the system you are trying to build.

    by offering a robust software architecture, automating the repetitive details,
    and providing the necessary infrastructure to help build modern web solutions.
    It provides an end-to-end, consistent development experience and improves your
    productivity. ABP gets you and your team up to speed with all the modern software
    development best practices pre-applied.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before you start to write your code, you need to create a foundation for your
    solution. This is one of the most challenging phases of building a software system.
    You have a lot of options and need to make some fundamental decisions. Any decision
    you make at this stage will likely affect your application for the rest of its
    lifetime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some common, well-known, system-level architectural patterns, such
    as **monolithic architecture**, **modular architecture**, and **microservice architecture**.
    Applying one of these architectures determines how you develop, deploy, and scale
    your solution and should be decided based on your requirements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to these system-level patterns, software development models such
    as **Command and Query Responsibility Segregation** (**CQRS**), **Domain-Driven
    Design** (**DDD**), **Layered Architecture**, and **Clean Architecture** determine
    how your code base is shaped.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you decide on your architecture, you should create the fundamental solution
    structure to start development with that architecture. In this phase, you also
    need to decide which language, framework, tools, and libraries you will use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All these decisions need significant experience, so they are ideally done by
    experienced software architects and developers. However, not all the team members
    will have the same experience and knowledge level. You need to train them and
    determine the correct coding standards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After setting up your architecture and preparing the fundamental solution, your
    team can start the development process. The next section discusses the common
    aspects that are repeated by every software solution and how you can avoid repeating
    them in your development.

    Computers automate the repetitive tasks of the real world to make people''s lives
    easier. So, why do we repeat ourselves while building software solutions?'

- en: Authentication is a very common concern of every software solution – single
    sign-on, Active Directory integration, token-based authentication, social logins,
    two-factor authentication, forgot/reset password, email activation, and more.
    Are most of these requirements are familiar to you? You are not alone! Almost
    all software projects have more or less similar requirements for authentication.
    Instead of building all these from scratch, using an existing solution, such as
    a library or a cloud service, is better. Such pre-built solutions are mature and
    battle-tested, which is important for security.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some non-functional requirements, such as exception handling, validation, authorization,
    caching, audit logging, and database transaction management, are other sources
    of code repetition. These concerns are called cross-cutting concerns and should
    be handled in every web request. In a well-architected software solution, these
    concerns should be handled automatically by conventions in a central place in
    your code base, or you should have services to make them easier to implement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you integrate to third-party systems, such as RabbitMQ and Redis, you typically
    want to create abstractions and wrappers around the code that interact with these
    systems. In this way, your business logic is isolated from these infrastructure
    components. Also, you don't repeat the same connection, retry, exception handling,
    and logging logic everywhere in your solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having a pre-built infrastructure to automate this repetitive work saves your
    development time so that you can focus on your business logic. The next section
    discusses another topic that takes up our time in every business application –
    the user interface.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    An application with an unfashionable and unusable UI would not be as attractive
    at first glance, even if it has outstanding business value under the hood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While UI features and requirements vary for every application, some fundamental
    structures are common. Most applications need basic elements, such as alerts,
    buttons, cards, form elements, tabs, and data tables. You can use HTML/CSS frameworks
    such as Bootstrap, Bulma, and Ant Design instead of creating a design system for
    every application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost every web application has a responsive layout with the main menu, toolbar,
    header, and footer with custom colors and branding. You will need to determine
    all these and implement a base UI kit for your application's pages and components.
    In this way, UI developers can create a consistent UI without dealing with the
    common structures.

    uniqueness, every enterprise system has some fundamental supporting requirements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A permission-based authorization system is one of these fundamental requirements.
    It is used to control the privileges of users and clients of the application.
    If you want to implement this yourself, you should create an end-to-end solution
    with database tables, authorization logic, permission caches, APIs, and UI pages
    to assign these permissions to your users and check them when needed. However,
    such a system is pretty generic and can be developed as a shared identity management
    functionality (a reusable module) and used by multiple applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like identity management, many systems need functionalities such as audit log
    reporting, tenant and subscription management (for SaaS applications), language
    management, file uploading and sharing, multi-language management, and time zone
    management. In addition to the pre-built application functionalities (modules),
    there may be low-level requirements, such as implementing the soft-delete pattern
    and storing **Binary Large Object** (**BLOB**) data in your applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All these common requirements can be built from scratch, which can be the only
    solution for some enterprise systems. However, if these functionalities are not
    the main value that's provided by your application, you can consider using pre-built
    modules and libraries where they are available and customize them based on your
    requirements.

    software solutions with best practices on top of the .NET and ASP.NET Core platforms.
    It provides the fundamental infrastructure, production-ready modules, themes,
    tooling, guides, and documentation to implement that architecture properly and
    automate the details and repetitive work as much as possible.

    is an opinionated framework. So, I should first explain what an unopinionated
    framework is and what an opinionated framework is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I stated in the *Setting up the architecture* section, preparing a foundation
    for a software solution requires a lot of decisions; you should decide on the
    system architecture, development model, techniques, patterns, tools, and libraries
    to use in your solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unopinionated frameworks, such as ASP.NET Core, don't say much about these decisions
    and mostly leave it up to you. For example, you can create a layered solution
    by separating your UI layer from the data access layer, or you can create a single-layered
    solution by directly accessing the database from your UI pages/views. You can
    use any library, so long as it is compatible with ASP.NET Core, and you can apply
    any architectural pattern. Being unopinionated makes ASP.NET Core flexible and
    usable in different scenarios. However, it assigns the responsibility to you to
    make all these decisions, set up the right architecture, and prepare your infrastructure
    to implement that architecture.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't mean ASP.NET Core has no opinion at all. It assumes you are building
    a web application or API based on the HTTP specification. It clearly defines how
    your UI and API layers should be developed. It also offers some low-level infrastructure
    components such as dependency injection, caching, and logging (in fact, these
    components are usable in any .NET application and not specific to ASP.NET Core,
    but they are mainly developed alongside ASP.NET Core). However, it doesn't say
    much about how your business code is shaped and which architectural patterns you
    will use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ABP Framework, on the other hand, is an opinionated framework. It believes that
    certain ways of approaching software development are inherently better and thus
    guide developers down those paths. It has opinions about the architecture, patterns,
    tools, and libraries you will use in your solution. Though ABP Framework is flexible
    enough to use different tools and libraries, and change your architectural decisions,
    you get the best value when you follow its opinions. But don't worry; it provides
    good, industry-accepted solutions to common architectures to help you build maintainable
    software solutions with best practices. The decisions it takes will save your
    time, increase your productivity, and make you focus on your business code rather
    than infrastructural problems.

    code principles. ABP offers a layered architecture based on DDD patterns and practices.
    It provides a layered startup template (see *The startup templates* section),
    the necessary infrastructure, and guidance for applying that architecture properly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In software development, modularity is a technique that's used to split a system
    into isolated parts, called modules. The ultimate goal is to reduce complexity,
    increase reusability, and enable different teams to work on different sets of
    features in parallel without affecting each other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Modularity has two main challenges that are simplified with ABP Framework:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first challenge is to isolate modules. ASP.NET Core has some features (such
    as Razor component libraries) to support modular applications. Still, it is very
    limited because it is an unopinionated framework and has opinions only for the
    UI and API parts. On the other hand, ABP Framework provides a consistent model
    and infrastructure to build fully isolated, reusable application modules with
    its database, domain, application, and UI layers.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second challenge of modularity is dealing with how these isolated modules
    communicate and become a single, unified application at runtime. ABP offers concrete
    models for common requirements of a modular system, such as sharing a database
    among modules, communicating between the modules via events or API calls, and
    installing a module in an application.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ABP provides many pre-built open source application modules that can be used
    in any application. Some examples include the Identity module, which provides
    user, role, and Permission Management, and the Account module, which provides
    login and register pages for your application. Reusing and customizing these modules
    saves your time. In addition, ABP provides a module startup template to help you
    build reusable application modules. An example of this can be found in [*Chapter
    15*](B17287_15_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor443), *Working with Modularity*.

    approaches, technologies, and tools together to solve unique problems. Every microservice
    system has its requirements and restrictions. Each team has a level of expertise,
    knowledge, and skills.

    It provides a distributed event bus for asynchronous communication between microservices
    with transaction support (as explained in the *Publishing domain events* section
    of [*Chapter 10*](B17287_10_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor316), *DDD – The Domain
    Layer*). It also provides C# client-side proxies to easily consume the REST APIs
    of remote services (as explained in the *Consuming HTTP APIs* section of [*Chapter
    14*](B17287_14_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor429), *Building HTTP APIs and Real-Time
    Services*).

    them into microservices. ABP also provides a detailed guide ([https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Best-Practices/Index](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Best-Practices/Index))
    to explain how you can create such microservice-compatible modules. In this way,
    you can start with a modular monolith, and then convert it into a microservice
    solution later.
