- en: Asynchronous programming is an exciting feature in C#. It allows you to continue
    program execution on the main thread while a long-running task runs in its own
    thread separately from the main thread. When this long-running task is complete,
    it will let the main thread know that it has completed (or failed). The benefit
    of asynchronous programming is that it improves the responsiveness of your application.
    The best way to learn and understand asynchronous programming is to experience
    it. The following recipes will illustrate some of the basics to you.

- en: What could be the use of a `void` return type in asynchronous methods? Generally,
    `void` is used with event handlers. Just bear in mind that `void` returns nothing,
    so you can't wait for it. Therefore, if you call a `void` return type asynchronous
    method, your calling code should be able to continue executing code without having
    to wait for the asynchronous method to complete.
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With asynchronous methods that have a return type of `Task`, you can utilize
    the `await` operator to pause the execution of the current thread until the called
    asynchronous method has completed. Keep in mind that an asynchronous method that
    returns a type of `Task` basically does not return an operand. Therefore, if it
    was written as a synchronous method, it would be a `void` return type method.
    This statement might be confusing, but it will become clear in the following recipes.
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, asynchronous methods that have a `return` statement have a return type
    of `TResult`. In other words, if the asynchronous method returns a Boolean, you
    would create an asynchronous method with a return type of `Task<bool>`.

    outputs as we have added them to the code in the `Chapter6` class and in the Windows
    application.

    folder. You will see that the exception is thrown, and the `catch` block runs
    the code to read the backup logfile instead:![How to do it…](img/B05391_06_19.jpg)

- en: The fact that we can await in `catch` and `finally` blocks allows developers
    much more flexibility, because asynchronous results can consistently be awaited
    throughout the application. As you can see from the code we wrote, as soon as
    the exception was thrown, we asynchronously read the file read method for the
    backup file.

  zh: 我们可以在`catch`和`finally`块中等待的事实，为开发者提供了更多的灵活性，因为异步结果可以在整个应用程序中一致地等待。正如您从我们编写的代码中可以看到的，一旦异常被抛出，我们就异步地读取了备份文件的读取方法。
