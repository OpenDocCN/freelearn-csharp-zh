<p class="calibre3">You may remember building a diorama project for school from a shoebox as a child. We're going to make one today, using Unity. Let's assemble our first scene, which is composed of simple geometric objects. Along the way, we'll talk a lot about <strong class="calibre5">world scale</strong>. Then we'll explore various 3D content creation tools that developers and artists use for assets imported into Unity. In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">A short introduction to the Unity 3D game engine</li>
<li class="calibre12">Creating a simple diorama in Unity</li>
<li class="calibre12">Making some measuring tools, including a unit cube and a grid projector</li>
<li class="calibre12">Using <strong class="calibre1">Blender</strong> to create a cube with texture maps and importing it into Unity</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting started with Unity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">If you don't have the Unity 3D game engine application installed on your PC yet, do that now! The full-featured <strong class="calibre5">Personal Edition</strong> is free and runs on both Windows and Mac. To get Unity, go to <a href="https://store.unity.com/" class="calibre10">https://store.unity.com/</a>, select the version that you want, click on Download Installer, and continue following the instructions. This book assumes you have version 2017.2 or later of Unity.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For you beginners out there, we're going to take this first section nice and slow, with more hand-holding than what you'll get later on in the book. Furthermore, even if you already know Unity and have developed your own games, it may be worthwhile to revisit the fundamental concepts, since the rules are sometimes different when designing for virtual reality.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a new Unity project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Let's create a new Unity project named <kbd class="calibre13">VR_is_Awesome</kbd>, or whatever you'd like.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To create a new Unity project, launch Unity from your operating system and the Open dialog box will appear. From this dialog box, select New, which opens a New Project dialog box, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/6b51fb65-2ad0-48c2-bf9a-a8557570f44c.png" class="calibre23"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Fill in the name of your project and verify that the folder location is what you want. Ensure that 3D is selected (on the right). There is no need to add any extra asset packages at this time, as we'll bring them in later if we need them. Click on Create project.</p>
<p>Unity 2018 introduced the Unity Hub tool for managing multiple Unity versions and projects. If you are using Unity Hub, you can choose the "3D" template, or one of the newer VR render pipeline templates for your project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Unity editor</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Your new project opens in the Unity editor, as shown in the following screenshot (where I arranged the window panels in a custom layout to facilitate this discussion and labeled the visible panels):</p>
<div><img src="img/7704e575-441b-4497-905f-b8a7677fa918.png" class="calibre24"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">The Unity editor consists of a number of non-overlapping windows, or <em class="calibre14">panels</em>, which may be subdivided into <em class="calibre14">panes</em>. Here's a brief explanation of each panel that is shown in the preceding layout image (your layout may be different):</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">The Scene panel on the upper left-hand side (highlighted) is where you can visually compose the 3D space of the current scene, including the placement of objects.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Below the Scene panel is the Game view (lower left-hand side), which shows the actual game camera view (presently, it is empty with an ambient sky). When in <strong class="calibre1">Play Mode</strong>, your game runs in this panel.</li>
<li class="calibre12">In the center, we have arranged the Hierarchy, Project, and Console panels (from the top to the bottom, respectively).</li>
<li class="calibre12">The Hierarchy panel provides a tree view of all the <em class="calibre2">objects</em> in the current scene.</li>
<li class="calibre12">The Project panel contains all the <em class="calibre2">reusable assets</em> for the project, including the ones imported as well as those that you'll create along the way.</li>
<li class="calibre12">The Console panel shows messages from Unity, including <em class="calibre2">warnings and errors</em> from code scripts.</li>
<li class="calibre12">On the right-hand side is the Inspector panel (highlighted), which contains the properties of the currently selected object. (Objects are selected by clicking on them in the Scene, Hierarchy, or the Project panel). The Inspector panel has separate panes for each component of the object.</li>
<li class="calibre12">At the top is the main menu bar (on a Mac, this will be at the top of your screen, not at the top of the Unity window). There's a toolbar area with various controls that we'll use later on, including the <strong class="calibre1">Play</strong> (triangle icon) button that starts Play mode.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">From the main menu bar's Window menu, you can open additional panels as needed. The editor's user interface is configurable. Each panel can be rearranged, resized, and tabbed by grabbing one of the panel tabs and dragging it. Go ahead, try it! On the upper right-hand side is a Layout selector that lets you either choose between various default layouts or save your own preferences.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The default world space</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">A default empty Unity scene consists of a Main Camera object and a single Directional Light object, as listed in the Hierarchy panel and depicted in the Scene panel. The Scene panel also shows a perspective of an infinite reference ground plane grid, like a piece of graph paper with nothing on it yet. The grid spans across the <em class="calibre14">x</em> (red) and <em class="calibre14">z</em> (blue) axes. The <em class="calibre14">y </em>axis (green) is up.</p>
<p>An easy way to remember the Gizmo axes colors is by keeping in mind that R-G-B corresponds to <em class="calibre2">X-Y-Z</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Inspector panel shows the details of the currently selected item. Select the Directional Light with your mouse, either from the Hierarchy list or within the scene itself, and look at the Inspector panel for each of the properties and components associated with the object, including its transform. An object's transform specifies its position, rotation, and scale in the 3D world space. For example, position (0, 3, 0) is 3 units above (in the <em class="calibre14">Y</em> direction) the center of the ground plane (<em class="calibre14">X</em> = <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <em class="calibre14">Z</em> = <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>). A rotation of (<kbd class="calibre13">50</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">330</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>) means that it's rotated 50 degrees around the <em class="calibre14">x </em>axis and 330 degrees around the <em class="calibre14">y </em>axis. As you'll see, you can change an object's transforms numerically here or directly with the mouse in the Scene panel.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Similarly, if you click on the Main Camera, it may be located at the (<kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">1</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">-10</kbd>) position with no rotation. That is, it's pointed straight ahead, towards the positive <em class="calibre14">Z</em> direction.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When you select the Main Camera, as shown in the preceding editor screenshot, a Camera Preview inset is added to the Scene panel, which shows the view that the camera presently sees. (If the Game tab is open, you'll see the same view there too). Presently, the view is empty and the reference grid does not get rendered, but a foggy horizon is discernible, with the grey ground plane below and the blue default ambient Skybox above.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a simple diorama</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Now, we will add a few objects to the scene to set up the environment, including a unit cube, a flat plane, a red ball, and a photographic backdrop. Here is a photograph of a physical mock-up of the diorama we will build in VR:</p>
<div><img src="img/c5e7b978-8989-4cd8-b79f-4f0ab499e920.png" class="calibre25"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding a cube</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Let's add the first object to the scene: a unit-sized cube.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Within the Hierarchy panel, use the Create menu and choose 3D Object | Cube. The same selection can also be found in the main menu bar's GameObject drop-down menu.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A default white cube is added to the scene, centered on the ground plane at the (0, 0, 0) position, with no rotation, and a scale of one, as you can see in the Inspector panel. This is the Reset setting, which can be found in the object's Transform component of the Inspector panel.</p>
<p>The Reset values of the Transform component are Position (<kbd class="calibre26">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre26">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre26">0</kbd>), Rotation (<kbd class="calibre26">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre26">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre26">0</kbd>), and Scale (<kbd class="calibre26">1</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre26">1</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre26">1</kbd>).</p>
<p class="calibre3">If for some reason your cube has other Transform values, set these in the Inspector panel or locate the small <em class="calibre14">gear</em> icon in the upper right-hand side of the Inspector panel's Transform component, click on it, and select Reset.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This cube has the dimensions of one unit on each side. As we'll see later, one unit in Unity corresponds to one meter in world coordinates. Its local center is the center of the cube.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding a plane</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Now, let's add a ground plane object into the scene.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the Hierarchy panel, click on the Create menu (or main GameObject menu) and choose 3D Object | Plane.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A default white plane is added to the scene, centered on the ground plane at Position (<kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>). (If necessary, select Reset from the Inspector panel's Transform component's <em class="calibre14">gear</em> icon). Rename it to <kbd class="calibre13">GroundPlane</kbd>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Note that at a scale of (<kbd class="calibre13">1</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">1</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">1</kbd>), Unity's plane object actually measures 10 by 10 units in X and Z. In other words, the size of <kbd class="calibre13">GroundPlane</kbd> is 10 by 10 units and its transform's Scale is 1.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The cube is centered at Position (<kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>), just like the ground plane. However, maybe it doesn't look like it to you. The Scene panel may show a Perspective projection that renders 3D scenes onto a 2D image. The Perspective distortion makes the cube not seem centered on the ground plane, but it is. Count the grid lines on either side of the cube. As you'll see, when it is viewed in VR and you're actually standing in the scene, it won't look distorted at all. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="calibre24" src="img/0622dbe6-78d4-466a-9e60-984e09066a94.png"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">The cube is submerged in the ground plane because its local origin is at its geometric center—it measures 1 by 1 by 1 and its middle point is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). This might sound obvious, but it is possible for the origin of a model to not be its geometric center (such as one of its corners). The Transform component's position is the world space location of the object's local origin. Let's move the cube as follows:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Move the cube onto the surface of the ground plane—in the Inspector panel, set its Y position to 0.5: Position (<kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>).</li>
<li class="calibre12">Let's rotate the cube a bit around the <em class="calibre2">y</em> axis. Enter 20 into its Y rotation: Rotation (<kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>).</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Note the direction in which it rotates. That's 20 degrees clockwise. Using your left hand, give a thumbs-up gesture. See the direction your fingers are pointing? Unity uses a left-handed coordinate system. (There is no standard for the coordinate system <em class="calibre14">handedness</em>. Some software uses left-handedness, others use right-handedness).</p>
<p>Unity uses a left-handed coordinate system. And the <em class="calibre2">y</em> axis is up.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding a sphere and some material</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Next, let's add a sphere. Select GameObject | 3D Object | Sphere from the menu.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Like the cube, the sphere has a radius of 1.0, with its origin at the center. (If necessary, select Reset from the Inspector panel Transform component's <em class="calibre14">gear</em> icon). It's hard to see the sphere as it is embedded in the cube. We need to move the sphere's position.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This time, let's use the Scene panel's <strong class="calibre5">Gizmos</strong> component to move the object. In the Scene view, you can select graphical controls, or Gizmos, to manipulate the objects transforms, as illustrated in the following screenshot from the Unity documentation (<a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PositioningGameObjects.html" class="calibre10">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PositioningGameObjects.html</a>):</p>
<div><img class="image-border" src="img/8ce24601-1cae-427f-a346-ef4f58a7b910.png"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">In the Scene panel, with the sphere selected, make sure that the Translate tool is active (second icon on the top-left icon toolbar) and use the arrows of the <em class="calibre14">x</em>, <em class="calibre14">y</em>, and <em class="calibre14">z </em>axes to position it. I left mine at Position (<kbd class="calibre13">1.6</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0.75</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">-1.75</kbd>).</p>
<p>A <strong class="calibre1">Gizmo</strong> is a graphical control that lets you manipulate the parameters of an object or a view. Gizmos have grab points or handles that you can click and drag with the mouse.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Before we go much further, let's save our work as follows:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">From the main menu bar, select File | Save Scene As... and name it <kbd class="calibre13">Diorama</kbd>.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Also, navigate to File | Save Project for good measure. Note that in the Project panel, the new scene object was saved in the top-level Assets folder.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Let's add some color to the scene by making a couple of colored materials and applying them to our objects. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">In the Project panel, select the top-level Assets folder and select Create | Folder. Rename the folder to <kbd class="calibre13">Materials</kbd>.</li>
<li class="calibre12">With the <kbd class="calibre13">Materials</kbd> folder selected, select Create | Material and rename it to <kbd class="calibre13">Red Material</kbd>.</li>
<li class="calibre12">In the Inspector panel, click the white rectangle to the right of Albedo, which opens the Color panel. Choose a nice juicy red.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Repeat the preceding steps to make a <kbd class="calibre13">Blue Material</kbd> too.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Select Sphere from the Hierarchy (or Scene) panel.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Drag the <kbd class="calibre13">Red Material</kbd> from the Project panel into the Inspector panel for the sphere. The sphere should now look red.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Select Cube from the Scene (or Hierarchy) panel.</li>
<li class="calibre12">This time, drag the <kbd class="calibre13">Blue Material</kbd> from the <kbd class="calibre13">Project</kbd> panel into the scene and drop it onto the cube. It should now look blue.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Save your scene and save the project. Here's what my scene looks like now (yours might be a little different, but that's OK):</p>
<div><img class="image-border1" src="img/50f9ebde-13f6-4557-91a3-27db3d77eaf7.png"/></div>
<p>Note that we're using the folders in the Project panel <kbd class="calibre26">/Assets/</kbd> directory to organize our stuff.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Changing the scene view</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">You can change the scene view any time in a number of ways, and this varies depending on whether you have a mouse with three-buttons, or two-buttons, or Mac with only one button. Read up on it in the Unity manual, which can be found at <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PositioningGameObjects.html" class="calibre10">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html</a>, to find out what works for you.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In general, combinations of left/right mouse clicks with the <em class="calibre14">Shift</em> + <em class="calibre14">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre14">Alt</em> keys will let you perform the following actions:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">Drag the camera around.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Orbit the camera around the current pivot point.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Zoom in and out.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Press <em class="calibre2">Alt</em> and right-click to swing the current eye orbit up, down, left, and right.</li>
<li class="calibre12">When the <strong class="calibre1">Hand</strong> tool is selected (in the upper-left icon bar), the right mouse button moves the eye. The middle-click of the mouse does a similar thing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">In the upper right-hand side of the Scene panel, you have the <strong class="calibre5">Scene View</strong> Gizmo, which depicts the current scene view orientation as shown in the following screenshot. It may indicate, for example, a Perspective view, with x extending back to the left and z extending back to the right:</p>
<div><img class="image-border2" src="img/8a3b97e1-8edc-4a55-82ae-624392098b46.png"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">You can change the view to look directly along any of the three axes by clicking on the corresponding colored cone as shown in the following screenshot. Clicking on the small cube in the center changes the Perspective view to the Orthographic (non-distorted) view:</p>
<div><img class="image-border3" src="img/91ecc775-19c9-45b7-a83f-94437f379199.png"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Before moving on, let's first align the scene view with the Main Camera direction. You may recall me saying that the default camera orientation, (<kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>), is looking down the positive z direction (back to front). Follow the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Click on the white z cone on the Scene View Gizmo to adjust the view from the Back (back direction), looking forward.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Also, use the Hand tool (or the middle mouse button) to slide the view up a tad.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Now, when you select the Main Camera component (from the Hierarchy panel), you will see that the Scene view is roughly similar to the Camera Preview, looking in the same direction. (See the screen capture image shown in the following section for what the scene and preview looks like with this view direction after we add the photo.)</p>
<p>For a full list of Unity shortcut hotkeys, see <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityHotkeys.html" class="calibre20">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityHotkeys.html</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding a photo</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Now, let's add a photo for the big-screen backdrop of our diorama.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In computer graphics, an image that is mapped onto an object is called a <strong class="calibre5">texture</strong>. While objects are represented in the x, y, and z world coordinates, textures are said to be in the U, V coordinates (such as pixels). We'll see that textures and UV maps can have their own scaling issues. Follow the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Create a plane by navigating to GameObject | 3D Object | Plane and rename it <kbd class="calibre13">PhotoPlane</kbd>.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Reset the plane's transform. In the Inspector panel, find the <em class="calibre2">gear</em> icon on the upper right-hand side of the Transform panel. Click on this icon and select Reset.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Next, rotate it by 90 degrees around the <em class="calibre2">z </em>axis (set its Transform component's Rotation value of z to -90). That's <em class="calibre2">minus 90</em>. So, it's standing up, perpendicular to the ground.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Rotate it by 90 degrees around the <em class="calibre2">y </em>axis so that its front is facing us.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Move it to the end of the ground plane at Position value of <em class="calibre2">z</em> = <kbd class="calibre13">5</kbd> and above, at Position value of y = <kbd class="calibre13">5</kbd> (you may recall that the ground plane is 10 x 10 units).</li>
<li class="calibre12">Choose any photo from your computer to paste on this photo plane using Windows Explorer or Mac Finder. (Alternatively, you can use the <kbd class="calibre13">GrandCanyon.jpg</kbd> image that comes with this book).</li>
<li class="calibre12">In the Project panel, select the top-level Assets folder and navigate to Create | Folder. Rename the folder to <kbd class="calibre13">Textures</kbd>.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Drag the photo file into the <kbd class="calibre13">Assets/Textures</kbd> folder. It should automatically import as a texture object. Alternatively, you can right-click on the Assets folder, select Import New Asset..., and import the picture.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Select the new image Texture in the Project panel and review its settings in the Inspector panel. For Unity's rendering purposes, even if the original photo was rectangular, the texture is square now (for example, 2048 x 2048) and looks squished. When you map it onto a square-shaped face, it will be squished there too. Let's perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Drag the photo texture from the Project panel onto the photo plane (in the Scene panel).</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre27">Oops! In my case, the picture is rotated sideways—yours, too?</p>
<ol start="2" class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Select <kbd class="calibre13">PhotoPlane</kbd> (the photo plane) and set the Transform component's Rotation value of X to <kbd class="calibre13">90</kbd> degrees.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre27">OK, it's upright, but still squished. Let's fix this. Check the original resolution of your photo and determine its aspect ratio. My <kbd class="calibre13">Grand Canyon</kbd> image was 2576 x 1932. When you divide its width by its height, you get the 0.75 ratio.</p>
<ol start="3" class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">In Unity, set the <kbd class="calibre13">PhotoPlane</kbd> plane Transform component's Scale value of Z to <kbd class="calibre13">0.75</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre27">Because its scale origin is the center, we also have to move it back down a bit.</p>
<ol start="4" class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Set the Position value of y to <kbd class="calibre13">3.75</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why 3.75? The height started at 10. So, we scaled it to 7.5. The scaling of objects is relative to their origin. So now, the half of the height is 3.75. We want to position the center of the backdrop 3.5 unit above the ground plane.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We have the size and position set up, but the photo looks washed out. That's because the ambient lighting in the scene is affecting it. You might want to keep it that way, especially as you build more sophisticated lighting models and materials in your scenes. But for now, we'll un-light it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With <kbd class="calibre13">PhotoPlane</kbd> selected, note that the photo's Texture component in the Inspector panel has its default Shader component set as Standard. Change it to Unlit | Texture.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here's what mine looks like; yours should be similar:</p>
<div><img class="image-border4" src="img/038b07a3-eb34-4efe-9e42-4838d16a5e4a.png"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">There! That looks pretty good. Save your scene and project.</p>
<p>You may notice that Planes are only visible from their front. All surfaces in computer graphics have a front-facing direction (normal vector). The view camera must be towards the front face or else the object will not be rendered. This is a performance optimization. If you require a <em class="calibre2">plane</em> with faces on both sides, use a Cube scaled thinly, or two separate Planes facing away from each other.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Notice that if you check your Materials folder now, you'll find that Unity has automatically created a <kbd class="calibre13">GrandCanyon.mat</kbd> material for you that uses the <kbd class="calibre13">GrandCanyon.jpg</kbd> texture.</p>

<p class="calibre3">If you want to change the ground plane color, create a new material (in the Project panel), name it <kbd class="calibre13">Ground</kbd>, and drag it onto the ground plane. Then, change its Albedo color. I suggest using the dropper (icon) to pick an earth tone from the image in your photo plane.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Measurement tools</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">We've created a Unity scene, added a few primitive 3D objects, and created a couple of basic textures, including a photograph. Along the way, we learned about positioning and transforming objects in Unity's 3D world space. The problem is that the actual size of stuff in your scene is not always obvious. You could be zoomed up or you may be using either a Perspective or Orthographic view, or other features that affect the apparent size. Let's look at ways to deal with the scale.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Keeping a unit cube handy</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">I suggest keeping a unit cube handy in your Hierarchy panel. When it's not needed, just disable it (uncheck the checkbox in the top left-hand side of the Inspector panel). It can be used like a measuring stick, or rather, a measuring block, when needed. I use one to estimate actual world sizes of objects, distances between objects, heights, and elevations, and so forth. Let's do it now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Create a unit cube, name it <kbd class="calibre13">Unit Cube</kbd>, and place it somewhere out of the way for now, such as Position (<kbd class="calibre13">-2</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">-2</kbd>).</p>
<p class="calibre3">Leave it enabled for the time being.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using a Grid Projector</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">I want to tell you about the <strong class="calibre5">Grid Projector</strong>, a handy tool that is used to visualize a scale in any Unity scene. It's one of the Standard Assets in the Effects package. So, you may need to import it into your project. To import, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Select Assets in the main menu bar and then navigate to Import Package | Effects.</li>
<li class="calibre12">The Import dialog box pops up, containing a list of all the things that can get imported. Then select Import. </li>
</ol>
<p>If you cannot find the <kbd class="calibre26">Effects</kbd> package to import, you may not have installed <kbd class="calibre26">Standard Assets</kbd> when you installed Unity. To get them now, you will need to run the <kbd class="calibre26">UnityDownloadAssistant</kbd> again as described at the beginning of this chapter (and it may already be in your <kbd class="calibre26">Downloads</kbd> folder).</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now, we'll add a projector to the scene, as follows:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Find the Grid Projector prefab located in the Project panel by navigating to the <kbd class="calibre13">Assets/Standard Assets/Effects/Projectors/Prefabs</kbd> folder.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Drag a copy of the Grid Projector into your scene. Set the y value of the Position to <kbd class="calibre13">5</kbd> so that it's above the ground plane.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">The default Grid Projector is facing downward (Rotation value of x = 90), which is usually what we want. In the Scene view, you can see the Orthographic projection rays. A Unity doc (<a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Projector.html" class="calibre10">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Projector.html</a>) explains a Projector as follows:</p>
<p>A Projector allows you to project a Material onto all objects that intersect its frustum.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This means that the objects intersected by the projection rays will receive the projected material.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this case, as you'd expect, the projector material (also named <kbd class="calibre13">GridProjector</kbd>) has a <em class="calibre14">grid</em> texture, which simply looks like a crosshair. (See for yourself, in the <kbd class="calibre13">Assets/.../Projectors/Textures/Grid</kbd> object).</p>
<p class="calibre3">By default, the projector shines the grid pattern as a light on the surface that it illuminates. In our scene, the <kbd class="calibre13">GroundPlane</kbd> plane is a light color. So, the grid may not show up. Now, follow the following steps:</p>
<p class="calibre3">With Grid Projector selected in the Hierarchy panel, locate the <kbd class="calibre13">GridProjector</kbd> material component in the Inspector panel and change its Shader from Projector/Light to Projector/Multiply.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It now paints the white gridlines black. To get a better feel of what's going on, change the scene view to a Top view orientation, as follows:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Click the green y cone on the Scene View Gizmo in the upper right-hand side of the View panel.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Also, click the little cube at the center of the Gizmo to change from the Perspective to the Orthographic (flattened) view.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">You should now be looking straight down onto the ground plane. With the Grid Projector selected (make sure that the Translate tool is active, which is the second icon in the top-left icon toolbar), you can grab the Translate Gizmo attached to the Projector and move it from side to side. The grid line will move accordingly. You might leave it at Position (<kbd class="calibre13">-2.5</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">5</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">-0.5</kbd>) and avoid the projector Gizmo blocking the directional light.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At this point, the built-in view reference grid might be confusing. So, turn it off in the following way:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">In the Scene view panel, click on Gizmos (the menu with this name, which has options to control your Gizmos) and uncheck Show Grid.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre27">OK, so what does this get us? We can see that the default grid size measures half the edge of the unit cube. In Inspector, the Projector component's Orthographic size value is <kbd class="calibre13">0.25</kbd>.</p>
<ol start="2" class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Change the Projector's Orthographic size value from <kbd class="calibre13">0.25</kbd> to <kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd>.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Save the scene and the project.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Now we have a one-unit grid that can be turned on and projected onto the scene any time it is needed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let's leave it on for now because it looks kind of cool, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="image-border5" src="img/b3e1e5aa-1b61-4d2d-9e35-5607318eec64.png"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Measuring the Ethan character</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">How big is an avatar? Unity comes with a third-person character named <kbd class="calibre13">Ethan</kbd>. Let's add him to our scene. He's one of the <kbd class="calibre13">Standard Assets</kbd> in the <kbd class="calibre13">Characters</kbd> package. So, you may need to import that into your project.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To import, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Select Assets in the main menu bar and then navigate to Import Package | Characters.</li>
<li class="calibre12">The Import dialog box pops up, containing a list of all the things that can get imported. Click All and then Import. The <kbd class="calibre13">ThirdPersonController</kbd> is a prefab (pre-built asset) located in the Project panel. This can be found by navigating to the <kbd class="calibre13">Assets/Standard Assets/Characters/ThirdPersonCharacter/Prefabs</kbd> folder.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Drag a copy of <kbd class="calibre13">ThirdPersonController</kbd> into your scene. The exact x and z positions don't matter, but set y to <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd> so that the character named <kbd class="calibre13">Ethan</kbd> is standing on <kbd class="calibre13">GroundPlane</kbd>. I left mine at (<kbd class="calibre13">2.2</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0.75</kbd>).</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Let's try it out:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Click on the <em class="calibre2">Play</em> icon at the top of the Unity window in the center, to start your game. Use the <em class="calibre2">W</em>, <em class="calibre2">A</em>, <em class="calibre2">S</em>, and <em class="calibre2">D</em> keys to move him around. <em class="calibre2">Run, Ethan! Run!</em></li>
<li class="calibre12">Click on the <em class="calibre2">Play</em> icon again to stop the game and return to edit mode.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">So, how big is Ethan? According to Google search, the average height of a human male is 5 foot 6 inches, or 1.68 meters (in the USA, the average adult male is more like 5' 10" or 1.77 meters tall). Let's see how tall Ethan is when compared to these:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">Slide the unit cube next to Ethan using the Translate Gizmo</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre27">Alright, he's about 1.6 times its height</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">Scale the unit cube's height (y) to 1.6 and center its y position to 0.8</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Look again. As illustrated in the following screenshot, he's not quite 1.6. So, Ethan is a little shorter than the average male (unless you include his pointy hairdo). Swinging my view around, I'm looking Ethan right in the face, and by further adjusting the cube, the eye level is about 1.4 meters. Make a note of this:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Restore the unit cube's Scale (<kbd class="calibre13">1</kbd>,<kbd class="calibre13">1</kbd>,<kbd class="calibre13">1</kbd>) and Position (<kbd class="calibre13">-2</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">-2</kbd>)</li>
<li class="calibre12">Save the scene and the project</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">The following screenshot shows the comparison of the unit cube and Ethan:</p>
<div><img class="image-border6" src="img/ba258a68-f33b-4b53-a167-9672cb9e22f9.png"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using third-party content</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">So far we have shown you how to use Unity and be productive creating a scene, but with pretty simple content. Inherently, Unity is not a 3D modeling or asset creation tool. Rather (as the name <em class="calibre14">Unity</em> suggests), it's a unified platform for pulling together content from a variety of sources to assemble and program a game or experience involving animation, physics, rendering effects, and so on. If you are a 3D artist you may know how to create content in other programs like Blender, 3D Studio Max, or Maya. If not, you can find a plethora of models on the web.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One terrific source is the <strong class="calibre5">Unity Asset Store</strong> (<a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/" class="calibre10">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/</a>). Many asset packs are free, especially starter ones, with possible paid upgrades if you want more. If you are looking for a few things to get your learning and experimental projects going, here are some of my free favorites:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">Nature Starter Kit 1 and 2 (<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/nature-starter-kit-1-49962" class="calibre10">https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/nature-starter-kit-1-49962</a>)</li>

</ul>
<p>In addition to 3D models, the Asset Store contains an amazing amalgamation of development tools, add-ons, audio, and more. The Asset Store, its active community of developers, and its huge amount of content is one of the things that has made Unity so successful.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Asset Store is available directly within the Unity Editor. To access it, choose <strong class="calibre5">Window</strong> | <strong class="calibre5">Asset Store</strong> and begin exploring.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To add assets to your project using the Asset Store for example, simply find one and select Download, then choose Import to add it to your <kbd class="calibre13">Project Assets</kbd> folder. Asset packs often come with example scenes you can open to explore how it looks and works. After that, locate its <kbd class="calibre13">Prefab</kbd> folder and simply drag any prefabs into your own scene. An example is shown here:</p>
<div><img src="img/c4613402-acc5-4528-8f63-e62840c74b08.png" class="calibre24"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Furthermore, there are many sites for sharing 3D models, both free and for a fee. Some are oriented towards higher-end 3D CAD for engineers. Others cater to 3D printing enthusiasts. No matter. Just be sure to look for FBX or OBJ file formats of the model so they can be imported into Unity. Some of the more popular resource sites include:</p>

<p class="calibre3">Unity offers some basic geometric shapes, but when it comes to more complex models, you'll need to go beyond Unity. As we discussed, the Unity Asset Store and many sites have tons of amazing models. Where do they come from? Will you run into problems while importing them into Unity?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I know that this book is about Unity, but we're going on a short side adventure right now. We're going to use Blender (version 2.7x), a free and open source 3D animation suite (<a href="http://www.blender.org/" class="calibre10">http://www.blender.org/</a>), to make a model and then import it into Unity. Grab a coffee and strap yourself in!</p>
<p class="calibre3">The plan is not to build anything very fancy right now. We'll just make a cube and a simple texture map. The purpose of this exercise is to find out how well a one-unit cube in Blender imports with the same scale and orientation into Unity.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Feel free to skip this section or try a similar experiment using your favorite modeling software (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_3D_modeling_software" class="calibre10">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_3D_modeling_software</a>). If you prefer not to follow along or run into problems, a copy of the completed files created in this topic is available in the download package for this book.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Open the Blender application. Dismiss the opening splash screen. You will be in the Blender editor, which is similar to what's shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/91d6b51c-7696-401a-9237-2bc33588fe3d.png" class="calibre28"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Like Unity, Blender consists of a number of non-overlapping windows, and their layout can be customized to suit your needs. However, the Blender interface can be more daunting, in part because it integrates a number of different editors that can be opened at the same time, in their own panels.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It's helpful to realize that the default view, as shown in the preceding screenshot, contains five different editors!</p>
<p class="calibre3">The most obvious editor is the large <strong class="calibre5">3D View</strong>, which I highlighted with a (red) rectangle. This is where you can view, move, and organize the objects in your Blender scene.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The following are the other editors that are opened:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">The Info editor, which can be seen along the top edge of the app, has global menus and information about the application</li>
<li class="calibre12">The Timeline editor, which is present along the bottom edge of the app, is for animations</li>
<li class="calibre12">The Outliner editor, on the upper right-hand side, has a hierarchical view of the objects in your scene</li>
<li class="calibre12">The Properties editor, which can be seen to the right below the Outliner, is a powerful panel that lets you see and modify many properties of the objects in the scene</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Each editor can have multiple panes. Let's consider the 3D View editor:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">The large area in the middle is the <strong class="calibre1">3D Viewport</strong>, where you can view, move, and organize the objects in your Blender scene.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Just below the 3D Viewport is the editor <strong class="calibre1">Header</strong>, which is called so although it's at the bottom in this case. The Header is a row of menus and tools that provide great control over the editor, including view selectors, edit modes, transform manipulators, and layer management.</li>
<li class="calibre12">On the left-hand side is the Tool Shelf containing various editing tools that can be applied to the currently selected object, which can be organized into tabbed groups. The Tool Shelf can be toggled open or closed by grabbing and sliding its edge or by pressing the key <em class="calibre2">T</em>.</li>
<li class="calibre12">The 3D Viewport also has a <strong class="calibre1">Properties</strong> pane, which may be hidden by default and can be toggled open or closed by pressing the key <em class="calibre2">N</em>. It provides the property settings for the currently selected object.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">In the upcoming instructions, we will ask you to change the <strong class="calibre5">Interaction Mode</strong> of the 3D View editor, say between the Edit Mode and Texture Paint mode. This is selected in the Header, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/e87815ce-185b-45ba-bf48-9811bfd97e25.png" class="calibre24"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">The other editors also have the Header panes. The Info editor (at the top of the app) is only a Header! The outliner and Properties editors (on the right) have their Headers at the top of their panel rather than at the bottom.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once you recognize this layout, it doesn't look so crowded and confusing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Properties editor Header has a wide set of icons, which act like tabs, to select the group of properties presented in the rest of the panel. Hovering your mouse over the icon (like any of the UI widgets here) will show a tooltip with a better hint in regards to what it's for. It's pictured in the following images (in a couple of pages) when we get to using it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Blender layout is very flexible. You can even change a panel from one editor to another. At the far left of each Header is the Editor Type selector. When you click on it, you can see all the options.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In addition to the plethora of things that you can click on in the Blender interface, you can use just about any command using a keyboard shortcut. If you forget where to find a selection, press the space bar and type in your best guess of the command name that you're looking for. It just might pop up!</p>
<p class="calibre3">The following is a screenshot showing the Editor Type selector available in Blender:</p>
<div><img src="img/354e9cb3-bf93-47c2-ba5a-de5a4653806f.png" class="calibre24"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">A unit cube</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Now, let's build a unit cube in Blender.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The default scene may already have objects, including a cube, camera, and a light source, as shown earlier in the default Blender window. (Your startup settings may be different since that can be configured.)</p>
<p class="calibre3">If your startup scene does <em class="calibre14">not</em> contain a unit cube, create one, as follows:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Make sure that the scene is empty by deleting whatever is in it (right-click to select, <em class="calibre2">X</em> on the keyboard to delete).</li>
<li class="calibre12">Set the 3D cursor to the origin (<kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>,<kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>,<kbd class="calibre13">0</kbd>) using <em class="calibre2">Shift</em> + <em class="calibre2">S</em> (opens the Snap options list) | Cursor To Center.</li>
<li class="calibre12">In the left Tool Shelf panel, choose the Create tab and under Mesh select Cube to add a cube.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">OK, now we're all on the same page.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Note that in Blender, the reference grid extends in the <em class="calibre14">x</em> and <em class="calibre14">y </em>axes, and <em class="calibre14">z</em> is up (unlike Unity, where the <em class="calibre14">y </em>axis is up).</p>
<p class="calibre3">Furthermore, note that the default cube in Blender has a size of (<kbd class="calibre13">2</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">2</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">2</kbd>). We want a unit cube sitting on the ground plane at the origin. For this, follow the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Open the Properties pane with the keyboard <em class="calibre2">N</em> key</li>
<li class="calibre12">Navigate to Transform | Scale and set X, Y, Z to (<kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd>)</li>
<li class="calibre12">Navigate to Transform | Location and set Z to <kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre12">Press the <em class="calibre2">N</em> key again to hide the pane</li>
<li class="calibre12">You can zoom in using the scroll wheel of the mouse</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">For our purposes, also ensure that the current renderer is Blender Render (in the drop-down selector on the Info editor—at the top of the app window in the center).</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">UV Texture image</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Let's paint the faces of our cube. 3D computer models in Unity are defined by <em class="calibre14">meshes</em>—a set of Vector3 points connected with edges, forming triangular-shaped facets. When building a model in Blender, you can unwrap a mesh into a flattened 2D configuration to define the mapping of texture pixels to the corresponding areas on the mesh surface (UV coordinates). The result is called a UV Texture image.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We will create a <strong class="calibre5">UV Texture image</strong> for our cube, as follows:</p>
<ol start="1" class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Go into Edit Mode using the Interaction Mode selector in the bottom Header bar.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Select <em class="calibre2">all</em> (press the <em class="calibre2">A</em> key on the keyboard twice) to make sure that all the faces are selected.</li>
<li class="calibre12">In the left Tool Shelf panel, select the Shading/UVs tab.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Under UV Mapping click on Unwrap, select Smart UV Project from the drop-down list, accept the default values, and click on OK (the result, shown in the following screenshot, also shows what the unwrapped cube looks like).</li>
<li class="calibre12">Now, go into the Texture Paint mode using the Interaction Mode selector in the bottom Header bar again.</li>
<li class="calibre12">We need to define a <em class="calibre2">paint slot</em> for our material. Click on Add Paint Slot, select Diffuse Color, name it <kbd class="calibre13">CubeFaces</kbd>, and press OK.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">We can now start painting directly on the cube. Paint the front face first, as follows:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Make a smaller brush. In the left Tool Shelf panel, in the Tools tab, navigate to Brush | Radius and enter <kbd class="calibre13">8 px</kbd>.</li>
<li class="calibre12">It may be easier to work in an orthographic view. From the menu bar at the bottom, navigate to View | View Persp/Ortho.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Then, navigate to View | Front.</li>
<li class="calibre12">You can zoom in or out using the mouse scroll wheel if needed.</li>
<li class="calibre12">With your best handwriting, write the word <kbd class="calibre13">Front</kbd> using the left-click of the mouse and draw.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Now, the back face.</li>
<li class="calibre12">From the menu bar at the bottom, navigate to View | Back and select this face with a right-click.</li>
<li class="calibre12">With your best handwriting, write <kbd class="calibre13">Back</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Repeat the above process for the left, right, top, and bottom faces. If at some point it's not painting, make sure that there's a current face selected. Try right-clicking on the face to reselect it. The result should look something like this (shown side by side both in the 3D View editor with an orthographic perspective and in the UV/Image Editor):</p>
<div><img class="calibre24" src="img/7afaad07-0763-4da3-a0b9-42759928f22c.png"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Now, we need to save the texture image and set up its properties, as follows:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Change the current Editor Type to UV/Image Editor using the selector on the far left of the Header at the bottom of the 3D View editor.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Click on the Browse Image to be linked selector icon (just towards the left of the + icon) and choose <kbd class="calibre13">CubeFaces</kbd> from the list.</li>
<li class="calibre12">The Image menu item on the menu bar at the bottom now has an asterisk (Image*) indicating that there's an unsaved image. Click on it, select Save As Image, and save it as <kbd class="calibre13">CubeFaces.png</kbd>. Use a folder outside the Unity project.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="4" class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">On the right-hand side, in the Properties editor panel, find the long row of icons in its Header and select the Texture one (third from the last.) It may be hidden if the panel isn't wide enough; you can scroll down with your mouse to show it, as shown in the following screenshot:
<div><img src="img/a99a7f66-7b06-42ec-942a-7d15f83ba191.png" class="calibre24"/></div>
</li>
<li class="calibre12">Within the Texture properties, change Type to Image or Movie.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Then, in the Image group of properties, click on the Browse Image to be Linked selector icon (as shown in the following screenshot) and choose <kbd class="calibre13">CubeFaces</kbd>:
<div><img src="img/5c22d5b4-bd3a-469c-a66b-5edd9e424720.png" class="calibre24"/></div>
</li>
<li class="calibre12">You should see the labeled faces texture image in the Preview window.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Good! Let's save the Blender model, as follows:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Select File from the top main menu bar in the Info editor and click on Save (or press <em class="calibre2">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre2">S</em>).</li>
<li class="calibre12">Use the same folder as the one where you saved the texture image.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Name it <kbd class="calibre13">UprightCube.blend</kbd> and click on Save Blender File.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">We should now have two files in a folder, <kbd class="calibre13">UprightCube.blend</kbd> and <kbd class="calibre13">CubeFaces.png</kbd>. I use a folder named <kbd class="calibre13">Models/</kbd> in the root of my Unity project.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We recommend you then export the model as FBX format. This is a standard format for Unity. (Unity can import Blend files but may require you always have Blender installed on the same system). Use <strong class="calibre5">File</strong> | <strong class="calibre5">Export</strong> | <strong class="calibre5">FBX</strong> to save the <kbd class="calibre13">.fbx</kbd> version.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Wow, that was a lot. Don't worry if you didn't get it all. Blender can be daunting. However, Unity needs models. You can always download someone else's models from the Unity Asset Store and other 3D model sharing sites, or you can learn to make your own. Haha! Seriously, it's a good thing to start to learn. Actually, with VR, it's gotten a lot easier as we'll show you later in this chapter.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Importing into Unity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Back in Unity, we now want to import both the files, <kbd class="calibre13">UprightCube.fbx</kbd> and <kbd class="calibre13">CubeFaces.png</kbd>, one at a time, as follows:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">In the Project panel, select the top-level Assets folder, navigate to Create | Folder, and rename the folder to <kbd class="calibre13">Models</kbd>.</li>
<li class="calibre12">An easy way to import files into Unity is to just drag and drop the <kbd class="calibre13">.fbx</kbd> (or <kbd class="calibre13">.blend</kbd>) file from the Windows Explorer (or Mac Finder) window into the Project panel Assets/Models folder and drag and drop the <kbd class="calibre13">.png</kbd> file into the Assets/Textures folder (or you can use Assets | Import New Asset... from the main menu bar).</li>
<li class="calibre12">Add <kbd class="calibre13">UprightCube</kbd> to the scene by dragging it from the Assets/Models folder where it was just imported into the Scene view.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Set its position so that it's away from the other objects. I left mine at Position (<kbd class="calibre13">2.6</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">2.2</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">-3</kbd>).</li>
<li class="calibre12">Drag the <kbd class="calibre13">CubeFaces</kbd> texture from the Assets/Textures folder into the Scene view, hovering over the just added <kbd class="calibre13">UprightCube</kbd> so that it receives the texture, and drop the texture onto the cube.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">The scene should now look something like this:</p>
<div><img class="image-border7" src="img/d903d01a-6f7e-45ea-a4a9-403a8b9a3dac.png"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">A few observations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The back of the cube is facing us. Is that a mistake? Actually, it makes sense since the current viewpoint is looking forward. So, we should see the back of the cube. If you didn't notice already, the same goes for Ethan. It also seems like the cube has a one-unit dimension.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, on closer examination, in the cube's Inspector panel, you'll see it imported with the scale that we gave it in Blender (<kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">0.5</kbd>). Also, it has an X rotation of -90 (minus 90). Thus, if we reset the transform, that is, the scale to (<kbd class="calibre13">1</kbd>,<kbd class="calibre13">1</kbd>,<kbd class="calibre13">1</kbd>), it'll be 2 units in our world space and tipped over (so, don't reset it).</p>
<p class="calibre3">There's not much that we can do to compensate for the rotational adjustment without going back to Blender. But the scale can be adjusted in the model's Import Settings (in Inspector).</p>
<p>Blender's default up direction is Z, while Unity's is Y. Importing with a -90 X rotation adjusts for that. An imported scale can be adjusted in the object's Inspector panel's Import Settings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We have more control when it comes to exporting FBX from Blender. As shown in the screenshot, during Export you can customize the settings, for example, making Y the up axis and Z the forward one and setting the scale factor for import:</p>
<div><img src="img/0548128a-d68d-431e-914d-63a9ce46fff3.png" class="calibre24"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Before ending the preceding process, select <kbd class="calibre13">UprightCube</kbd> from the Hierarchy panel and drag it into the Project panel's Assets folder. (You may consider making an Assets/Prefabs subfolder and placing it into that.) This makes it a reusable prefab, texture image and all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There are some important lessons in this exercise (other than having learned a little bit about Blender) that apply to any 3D Unity project, including the VR ones. Normally, you will be importing models that are much more complex than a cube. You will likely run into issues related to data conversion, scale, orientation, and UV texture images that might be confusing at best. If this happens, try to break the problem into smaller, more isolated scenarios. Do little tests to gain insight into how applications exchange data and to help you understand which parameter tweaks might be necessary.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating 3D content in VR</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In addition to traditional 3D modeling software like Blender (and ZBrush, 3D Studio Max, Maya, and so on) there is a new generation of 3D design apps that let you to directly create inside VR. After all, it's pretty awkward trying to use an inherently 2D desktop screen with a 2D mouse to form, sculpt, assemble, and manipulate 3D models. If only it could be more like real-life sculpture and construction. So, why not just do it directly in 3D? In VR!</p>
<p class="calibre3">Like other digital platforms, we can categorize VR apps into ones that present an experience, ones where you interact to engage with the environment, and ones where you actually create content, for yourself or for sharing. An example of the latter and one of the first to be widely successful is Google Tilt Brush (<a href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/" class="calibre10">https://www.tiltbrush.com/</a>) where you paint in 3D. This is one my favorite go-to apps when introducing VR to family and friends. Tilt Brush lets you paint in 3D in virtual reality.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Other VR 3D with sculpting and painting tools, to name just a few, include:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre1">Google Blocks</strong>: Low poly modeling (<a href="https://vr.google.com/blocks/" class="calibre10">https://vr.google.com/blocks/</a>)</li>

</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Making stuff and playing with it in VR is creative and fun, but to be useful and productive, you need to be able to share your creations outside of the app. Most VR sculpting tools let you export the models to share on the Internet, export in FBX file format, for example, and import them into Unity. There are two different workflows to do this:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre1">Export/Import</strong>: In the first workflow you make a model and export it to a compatible format, like FBX. This is akin to traditional 3D software like we did with Blender.</li>
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre1">Publish/Import</strong>: The second workflow is to upload it to a sharing service and subsequently download and install it into your Unity project.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">In this section, we will use Tilt Brush as an example. Suppose you have Google Tilt Brush and a compatible VR rig. Further, suppose you have a creation you'd like to integrate with your VR app with Unity. Let's walk through each workflow process.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I opened Tilt Brush in VR and created a masterpiece using the Paper ribbon brush. I call it <em class="calibre14">TiltBox</em>, consistent with the cube theme we're using in this chapter. I know, it's beautiful.</p>
<p>The Tilt Brush features and user interface presented here (at the time of writing) are considered by Google to be in beta or experimental and are subject to change by the time you read this.</p>
<div><img src="img/6d4e7291-7f8d-46cf-97da-f6830331240f.png" class="calibre29"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Exporting and importing Tilt Brush models</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">We are going to export our model as FBX and then import it into Unity. This is an advanced topic so if you're new to Unity you may want to skip this topic for now and look at the <em class="calibre14">Publishing and importing with Google Poly</em> section instead.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In Tilt Brush, to export, go to the Save panel and choose the More Options… | Labs | Export menu. (Note the location of the Export option may change in a future release.)</p>
<p class="calibre3">The default folder where your files are saved in Windows is <kbd class="calibre13">Documents/Tilt Brush/Exports/[DrawingName]/</kbd>. If you turn your right-hand controller around you'll discover an Info panel on the back, which is a message console that reports the actual pathname of the drawing on your system, as shown here:</p>
<div><img src="img/8833c058-06c5-4fe3-853f-aefbe507d7cf.png" class="calibre24"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">The folder will contain several files, including the <kbd class="calibre13">.fbx</kbd> of the model and the <kbd class="calibre13">.png</kbd>'s of the brush textures (not used, as the Tilt Brush Toolkit also provides them).</p>
<p class="calibre3">To import into Unity you need the Tilt Brush Toolkit Unity package. The Google Poly package includes the toolkit (install from the Asset Store as described in the next topic). Or install it directly from GitHub, as follows:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Go to <a href="https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush-toolkit" class="calibre10">https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush-toolkit</a> and use the download link for <kbd class="calibre13">tiltbrush-UnitySDK-vNN.N.N.unitypackage</kbd> (via <a href="https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush-toolkit/releases" class="calibre10">https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush-toolkit/releases</a>)</li>
<li class="calibre12">Import the toolkit in Unity using Assets | Import Package | Custom Package…, then press Import</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">You'll find that the toolkit includes assets for rendering brushes. </p>
<p>There is also a <kbd class="calibre26">README</kbd> file in the <kbd class="calibre26">Exports</kbd> folder with details about your Tilt Brush version and export capabilities, including how to use the <kbd class="calibre26">CFG</kbd> file for tweaking various options for advanced users.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now we can import the drawing's FBX:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Drag the FBX file into your Project Assets (or use Assets | Import New Asset…).</li>
<li class="calibre12">Ignore any materials created by the import; we will use those provided in the toolkit. You can disable this in the model’s Import settings Materials <strong class="calibre1">|</strong> Import <strong class="calibre1">Materials</strong> uncheck, and then click Apply.</li>
<li class="calibre12">You can now drag the model to your scene.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Locate the brush material for your sketch in <kbd class="calibre13">Assets/TiltBrush/Assets/Brushes/</kbd>. In our case, the sketch uses Paper brush strokes, located in the <kbd class="calibre13">Basic/Paper/</kbd> subfolder.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Drag the material onto your sketch strokes as needed.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Your scene now contains your Tilt Brush sketch. For more advanced features including audio reactive features, animations, and VR teleportation, please refer to the Tilt Brush documentation and example scenes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was not too difficult although a bit tedious. Other 3D modeling apps require a similar process to export models and import into Unity.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Publishing and importing using Google Poly</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Fortunately, Google has made things a whole lot easier with the introduction of Google Poly (<a href="https://poly.google.com/" class="calibre10">https://poly.google.com/</a>) as a place to publish, browse, and download free 3D objects created with Google Tilt Brush and Google Blocks (and other apps that create OBJ files with materials).</p>
<p class="calibre3">I don't mean to sound like a Google fanboy, but let's stick to the Tilt Brush theme. Within Tilt Brush, it is very easy to publish your sketches to Google Poly with the click of a button. And importing Poly models into Unity is equally easy with the Poly Toolkit Unity package available on the Asset Store. Let's go through it:</p>
<p>Poly is not just for Unity developers. Google provides SDK for access from many platforms. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/poly/" class="calibre20">https://developers.google.com/poly/</a>.</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Within Tilt Brush, first, ensure that you are logged into your Google account (My Profile).</li>
<li class="calibre12">On the Save menu panel, choose the cloud upload option, as shown. This will upload your sketch to Poly.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="3" class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Then complete the publishing step in your browser (out of VR), and press Publish.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that Poly Toolkit includes the Tilt Brush Toolkit. If you already imported the Tilt Brush toolkit into your project from the previous section, we suggest you delete it (and the third-party folders) first before importing Poly to avoid conflict.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In Unity:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Open the Asset Store panel (Window | Asset Store)</li>
<li class="calibre12">Search for <kbd class="calibre13">Poly Toolkit</kbd>, then Download and Import the Poly Toolkit asset package into your project (<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/poly-toolkit-104464" class="calibre10">https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/poly-toolkit-104464</a>)</li>
<li class="calibre12">Note that the toolkit installs a new Poly menu in the Unity menu bar. Choose Poly | Browse Assets… to open the Poly browser panel, as shown:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/6b82dfb7-bf8a-4bd4-9b22-82288df138bf.png" class="calibre24"/></div>
<ol start="4" class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">This panel can be docked in the Unity editor by dragging its tab</li>
<li class="calibre12">Before you can browse your own uploads, you must sign in using the Sign In button in the upper right</li>
<li class="calibre12">Then, in the Poly Toolkit panel's Show selection, choose Your Uploads</li>
<li class="calibre12">Locate the model you wish to import. Its page includes a number of import options, including scaling and recentering the model transform</li>
<li class="calibre12">Choose Import Into Project</li>
<li class="calibre12">By default, it will import the model into the <kbd class="calibre13">Project Assets/Poly/Assets/</kbd> folder as a prefab</li>
<li class="calibre12">Drag the model's prefab from the folder into your scene</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">That's it. You now have a world of 3D models at your fingertips: ones you created and published on Poly and others you've discovered on Poly, the Unity Asset store, or the plethora of other 3D model sites you can explore.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Editing Unity in VR with EditorXR</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we have learned about the Unity Editor—a tool for creating 3D scenes and projects on a 2D computer screen. We also learned a bit about Blender—a tool for creating 3D assets on at 2D computer screen. Then we progressed to the new generation of 3D asset creation tools in virtual reality including Tilt Brush and Poly. Now we'll explore creating VR scenes directly in virtual reality too!</p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="calibre5">Unity EditorXR</strong> (<strong class="calibre5">EXR</strong>) is a new experimental feature of Unity (at time of writing) where you can edit your 3D scenes directly in VR rather than on your 2D monitor. In this section, we may be getting ahead of ourselves in more ways than one. This is both an advanced topic and an experimental one. If you are just getting started with VR, or if you are just getting started with Unity, you may want to skip this topic for now and come back at a later time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">EXR is an advanced topic because it assumes you are comfortable with using the Unity Editor windows, are used to thinking in 3D, and are somewhat experienced in working with 3D assets. It also assumes you have a VR rig with tracking hand controllers, like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. You will need a powerful PC with a high-end graphics card if you hope to have any chance of a smooth, comfortable experience. And last but not least, some of EXR's user interaction conventions take some learning and getting used to.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Despite that, EXR is a pretty sweet project that you could start using today to be productive. Especially if you're not afraid of software that is experimental. This also means that the UI we describe in this book is certainly subject to change. (For example, at this moment in time the package is being rebranded from EditorVR to EditorXR and EXR).

</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Another reason EXR is an advanced topic this early in this book is that we need to enable VR in our project, a topic we do not get to until the next chapter. But we'll walk you through it now quickly without a lot of explanation.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up EditorXR</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">To get started using EXR in your projects, download and install the Unity package. By the time you read this, it may already be bundled with the Unity Download Assistant or available in the Asset Store:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Download the EditorXR Unity package (<a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EditorXR/releases" class="calibre10">https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EditorXR/releases</a>).</li>
<li class="calibre12">Import it into your project (Assets | Import Package | Custom Package…).</li>
<li class="calibre12">If you are using a version earlier than Unity 2018, download and import Text Mesh Pro from the Asset Store (<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/textmesh-pro-84126" class="calibre10">https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/textmesh-pro-84126</a>), a free asset from Unity Technologies.</li>
<li class="calibre12">If you are using VIVE, download and import the SteamVR Plugin from the Asset Store (<a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647" class="calibre10">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647</a>).</li>
<li class="calibre12">If you are using Oculus Rift with Touch controllers, download and import the Oculus Utilities for Unity (<a href="https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/" class="calibre10">https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/</a>).</li>
<li class="calibre12">Set up your default VR platform in Player Settings (Edit | Project Settings | Player). Find the XR Settings section (at bottom of the Inspector panel) and check the Virtual Reality Supported checkbox.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Add the Virtual Reality SDKs for Oculus and/or OpenVR.</li>
<li class="calibre12">If you are using Oculus Rift with touch controllers, make sure the Oculus one comes first, as shown:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/abccaebe-eb93-4531-9507-1401327bc54b.png" class="calibre30"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">When you’re ready to launch into EXR:</p>
<ol class="calibre15">
<li class="calibre12">Select Windows | EditorXR</li>
<li class="calibre12">If necessary, press Toggle Device View to make the VR view active</li>
<li class="calibre12">Then put on your headset</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Now you can access much of the same editing features found in Unity Editor but within VR.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using EditorXR</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The user interaction in EXR is similar to Google Tilt Brush. One hand holds your menu palette and the other picks functions from it. Like a boxy glove, you can change menus with the flick of your thumb to rotate menu box faces. That’s the starting point but EXR is ever more complex, as it needs to provide the rich set of Unity Editor features in your virtual workspace, compounded with the need to navigate the scene, organize your editor panels, and of course edit your scene game objects. We encourage you to watch a few demo videos before jumping in.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The hand controller selectors implement an innovative, simultaneous combination of laser pointers for picking distant objects and grabbing (via a <em class="calibre14">selection cone</em>) for objects within reach, as illustrated here:</p>
<div><img src="img/97ec85dc-2360-4c47-a634-6cdf95b785f9.png" class="calibre31"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">To manipulate objects, EXR has implemented robust 3D versions of the familiar scene editor widgets in the 2D Editor. They’re really quite powerful and easy to use.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Without going into much further detail, here are the key features in EXR editor:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre1">Selection</strong>: Robust use of the hand controller thumbpad/stick, buttons, trigger, and grib</li>
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre1">Menus</strong>: Boxed glove menu panels, radial menu, shortcuts, and tools to organize panels in 3D</li>
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre1">Navigation</strong>: Move throughout your scene as you work, fly and blink modes, rotate in place, scale the world, use a mini-world view</li>
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre1">Workspaces</strong>: Correspond to windows in the 2D editor, for Project, Hierarchy, Inspector, Console, Profile, and more, can be opened and placed in the VR work area</li>
<li class="calibre12">Other features include locked objects, snapping,</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">The following diagram shows how the manipulator Gizmo can be used for direct manipulation of the current selected object, in conjunction with the radial menu on your controller, to switch tools:</p>
<div><img src="img/dd383c2b-c065-4644-b073-fee429d72e99.png" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps one of the more challenging things to learn in EXR is what each of the hand controls do as they switch meaning depending on the current context. The following diagram shows the controller guides for the VIVE:</p>
<div><img src="img/8170f9c3-268a-41bd-aa48-b25e8c8c9bd5.png" class="calibre33"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Controller guides for the Oculus touch are shown here:</p>
<div><img src="img/ace8c8d0-51c3-4355-abac-83804e173f5f.png" class="calibre34"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">To wrap up this topic, you can even use Google Poly to find objects and insert them into your scene in VR. An example of the third-party extensions of the EditorXR interface and API, the Poly workspace is available in VR. If you have the Poly Toolkit installed (as discussed) and you are using EditorXR, then Poly is one of the available workspaces. Open it to browse and add 3D models from the cloud into your scene, as shown:</p>

<p>To learn more about EditorXR and Google Poly see this debut blog post by Matt Schoen of Unity Labs: <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/11/30/learn-how-googles-poly-works-with-unity-editorxr/" class="calibre20">https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/11/30/learn-how-googles-poly-works-with-unity-editorxr/</a>. As a side note, Schoen is a friend and the co-author of another book from Packt, <em class="calibre2">Cardboard VR Projects for Android</em> (2016): <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/cardboard-vr-projects-android" class="calibre20">https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/cardboard-vr-projects-android</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we built a simple diorama, became more acquainted with the Unity editor, and learned about the importance of world scale in designing your scenes, including several in-game tools to help us work with scaling and positioning.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We then emphasized that Unity is not so much an asset creation tool. Developers typically use tools outside of Unity and then import their models. We introduced you to the free and open source Blender modeling app as well as Google Tilt Brush and showed you how to export assets and then import them into Unity, including cloud services like Google Poly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One of the really cool things about developing for VR is how quickly things are changing. It's the burgeoning of a new industry, a new media, and new paradigms evolve year to year as VR comes into its own. New devices are being introduced every quarter. Unity is updated every month. New software tools are released every week. There are new things to do and learn every day. Of course, this can also be very frustrating. My advice is to not let this get to you, and rather embrace it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One key to this is to continuously try new things. That’s what we tried to usher you through in this chapter. Come up with an idea, then see if you can get it to work. Try out new software. Learn a new Unity feature. Do things one at a time so you don't become overwhelmed. Of course, that's what this book is about. The journey is a continuous and adventurous one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next chapter, we'll set up your development system and Unity settings to build and run the project to play in your VR headset.</p>
