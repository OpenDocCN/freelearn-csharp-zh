- en: In the previous chapters, you examined solution selling, driving due diligence
    concepts, and solution envisioning with Sure Step. This chapter will walk you
    through the fascinating discipline of managing projects. The field of project
    management is emerging because quality has become a competitive instrument over
    the years. The **Project Management Institute** (**PMI**) defines project management
    as *the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities
    to meet project requirements*. Being a project manager in charge of software implementation
    projects is a challenging and demanding responsibility. Good project managers
    combine various skills in a balanced way. They need to bring leadership, communication,
    negotiation, problem solving, and influencing capabilities into practice in a
    unique and temporary environment. And when things go wrong, project managers usually
    find themselves in the eye of the storm. Nevertheless, managing projects brings
    great rewards. Successfully implementing business solutions implies that your
    customer organization will benefit from more efficiency in its daily routines
    because of your team's effort and quality. At the same time, you create and manage
    a context in which consultants can realize their professional ambitions.

    project management cause for every assignment, which is a glaring contrast to
    the tolerance for the unstructured approach. Now what kind of resistance do we
    face? The opinion that project management has a lot of overhead is widespread.
    At the same time, it is often seen as an obstacle to flexibility. Many people
    consider project management as the theorizer's way of doing things diametrically
    opposed to the management's prime directive of getting things done.

  zh: 项目管理是开销吗？
- en: 'What is overhead? From a cost-accounting perspective, overhead costs are the
    costs incurred for operating a business but that do not generate revenue or profits
    directly. Typical overhead costs include those for accounting, advertising, depreciation,
    insurance, interest, legal fees, rent, repairs, supplies, taxes, telephone bills,
    travel, and utilities costs. Using this logic, the question of whether or not
    expense on project management is an overhead leads to another question: do we
    send invoices to our customers for the project management services that we provide?
    However, is this the crucial question? According to this line of reasoning, we
    should categorize our sales costs as an overhead and should not be invoicing the
    services of our sales teams. If we were to partly invoice our project managers,
    does this make the overhead question redundant?'

  zh: 什么是额外开销？从成本会计的角度来看，额外开销是指运营业务产生的成本，但这些成本不会直接产生收入或利润。典型的额外开销包括会计、广告、折旧、保险、利息、法律费用、租金、维修、供应、税收、电话费、差旅和公用事业费用。按照这种逻辑，关于项目管理支出是否是额外开销的问题引出了另一个问题：我们是否向客户开具项目管理服务的发票？然而，这是关键问题吗？根据这种推理，我们应该将我们的销售成本归类为额外开销，并且不应该向我们的销售团队开具服务发票。如果我们部分向项目经理开具发票，这会使额外开销问题变得多余吗？
- en: When the skeptics refer to project management as an overhead cost, they often
    think about a mountain of papers and quite a few procedures and administrative
    tasks associated with the project management discipline. This criticism can be
    legitimate when their project management practice is not scaled to the size and
    complexity of the projects or to their organizational structure. Ignorance is
    usually at the basis of these failing project management procedures.

  zh: 当怀疑论者将项目管理称为额外开销时，他们通常想到的是与项目管理学科相关的一大堆文件和许多程序和行政任务。当他们的项目管理实践没有根据项目的大小和复杂性或他们的组织结构进行扩展时，这种批评可能是合理的。这些失败的项目管理程序通常基于无知。
- en: To answer the overhead question, we need to assess the benefits of our project
    management practice. Does it contribute to our project's profit and quality? Does
    it add value to our customers and team? If the answer to these two questions is
    positive, it is clearly not an overhead. If you cannot extract these benefits,
    your project management expenditure may be labeled as an overhead. Project management
    is what you and your organization make of it, and it can either turn into an overhead
    or a value-added service.

  zh: 为了回答这个问题，我们需要评估我们项目管理实践的好处。它是否有助于我们项目的利润和质量？它是否为我们的客户和团队增加了价值？如果这两个问题的答案是肯定的，那么它显然不是一项额外开销。如果你无法提取这些好处，你的项目管理支出可能被标记为额外开销。项目管理是你和你所在组织如何定义的，它可能变成额外开销，也可能变成增值服务。
- en: So when the skeptics cry out that project management adds to overhead, they

    They think that project management procedures will decrease their ability to respond
    to unpredicted changes, and it doesn't take long before their reasoning sets project
    management against a pragmatic approach. So, isn't project management concerned
    with practical matters? Do we lose the ability to change, and does project management

- en: Mostly, this aversion towards project management finds its breeding ground in
    the inability to separate the essentials from the side issues. People struggling
    with this dilemma overemphasize the importance of all the described project management
    tools, documents, and steps of a methodology. They spend too much time administering
    and describing the project, losing valuable time for the real management of the
    project and its practical matters. A bureaucratic vision of project management
    causes a contrast with the "let's just get on with the job" approach.

  zh: 大多数情况下，这种对项目管理的不适应源于无法区分主要问题和次要问题。那些在这场困境中挣扎的人们过分强调所有描述的项目管理工具、文档和方法步骤的重要性。他们花费太多时间在管理和描述项目上，从而失去了对项目真正管理和实际事务的宝贵时间。官僚主义的项目管理观念与“让我们直接开始工作”的方法形成了鲜明对比。
- en: Good project management practice is all about managing change, practical matters,
    and flexibility. By keeping it result driven, lean, and mean, it will empower
    you to make the project happen. A good project manager is not a bureaucrat, but
    is a tightrope walker, balancing the need for administration, steps, and tools
    in each project. Now that's easier said than done, and it takes a seasoned project
    manager with thorough knowledge of the project management discipline to realize
    the structured flexibility. Although unskilled and inexperienced project managers
    tend to get a hold of the rigid procedures, company executives cannot go scot-free
    either when speaking about obstacles to flexibility. They are responsible for
    the company's culture, and this culture represents the limit of what is achievable
    for the company.

- en: The previous chapter, which is about solution selling, will probably enable
    you to answer this question by yourself. A project management practice that unleashes
    value and benefits for the customer must be salable. If you can't get it sold,
    you struggle to sell the value of your methodology and/or you cannot convince
    the customer of the need for it. This can be related to the intrinsic values of
    your methodology or to a failing sales process. We are used to selling our software,
    business consultancy services, and development expertise, but how familiar are
    we with selling a project management service? Do we have a good selling strategy
    in place for valuing this type of service? If you want to get project management
    sold, it must be a real element of your adaptable value proposition, necessary
    for good bridge selling. Your customer or prospect may not be familiar with the
    landscape of implementation projects and the need for project management, and
    they may be nervous or even frightened to traverse it. Your value proposition
    for project management services needs to be flexible and adaptable to variations
    in each opportunity. A notable fact is that those who claim not to be able to
    sell project management have no adaptable value proposition for it, and yet price
    their project managers as the most expensive individuals on the team. In this
    way, they create their own obstacles.

  zh: 前一章关于解决方案销售的内容可能会让你自己回答这个问题。能够为顾客释放价值和利益的项目管理实践必须是可销售的。如果你无法将其销售出去，你将难以销售你的方法论的价值，或者无法说服客户其必要性。这可能与你的方法论的内生价值有关，或者与销售流程的失败有关。我们习惯于销售我们的软件、商业咨询服务和开发专业知识，但我们对于销售项目管理服务的熟悉程度如何？我们是否为这种服务制定了良好的定价策略？如果你想销售项目管理，它必须成为你适应价值主张的一个真实元素，这对于良好的桥梁销售是必要的。你的客户或潜在客户可能不熟悉实施项目的景观和项目管理需求，他们可能对此感到紧张，甚至害怕去探索。你的项目管理服务价值主张需要灵活且适应每个机会的变化。一个值得注意的是，那些声称无法销售项目管理的人，对于它没有适应性的价值主张，却将项目经理定价为团队中最昂贵的人。通过这种方式，他们为自己设置了障碍。

    want a project management practice that is pragmatic, you need to define pragmatic
    goals as well. What does it need to succeed in your organization and your specific

    about it. Most companies have a set of specific metrics for their sales, marketing,
    finance, and operational systems and services based on well-considered and specific
    objectives. If projects are the essential component of your services business,
    you need to have these objectives as well for your project management practice.
    Without them, it's a hard road to improve on your project's profit and customer
    satisfaction. Yes, "on time" and "within budget" is measurable, but can you measure
    "within scope" and "meets quality expectations" without set specifications? How
    is your current project management practice contributing to these goals? What
    would be the effect if your current project management procedures were put on
    hold? How can you improve your project management practice in the future, or will
    you still be working with exactly the same procedures in a few years? There's
    room for smarter objectives if you are really seeking a value-adding project management
    practice. So, before you start beating your brains out on how to implement a project

    If the customer is willing to pay for these services on their engagements, the

    the deployment of project management principles on their projects dependent on
    the ability to sell the project and on the customer's ability to understand the
    need for project management. Failing to get a customer budget for project management
    implies an unmanaged implementation. You certainly know the cases where a sales
    manager communicates that there is little (if any) budget for project management.
    Then what happens? It's a remarkable fact that, in these circumstances, a project

    manager is assigned nevertheless. Who wants to be in this person's shoes? Usually,

    methods for quality control and improvement. You have probably encountered customer
    organizations where methods such as **ISO** (**International Organization for

    One of the best examples illustrating this is Toyota. They became the largest
    car manufacturer in the world, owing a great part of this success to their quality
    management strategy and the branding of it. Many others followed, either inspired
    by the example of successful quality companies such as Toyota, or even because
    they were forced to do so. Today, many suppliers don't have a choice, but need
    to conform to standards such as ISO. As IT professionals, we do not have to look
    far to see quality management arising in our daily jobs as well. **Information
    Technology Infrastructure Library** (**ITIL**), a widely-adopted and consistent
    documentation of best practice for **IT service management** (**ITSM**) and **Capability

    serve as an alibi for a so-called quality approach, but usually only represent
    a one-way ticket for the file cabinet. These documents are experienced by most

    Doing your project documentation is not a championship in writing the most number

    unstructured, miss good conclusions, and contain too many gray areas. They also
    tend to get out of balance in terms of content, including having too much content
    devoted to introductions and less complicated topics, while lacking good content
    on the more complex and rather important issues. This makes these documents not
    only hard to read but incomplete as well. Why do we need so much paper to bring
    insignificant content? Now put yourself in your customer's position for a minute.

    elements. Without these beacons, the project team's communication will be uncontrolled
    and unguided. At the same time, your communication strategy needs to align with
    your overall project life cycle organization. For example, when can your customer
    expect the delivery of a document containing the requirements or design of a proposed
    solution? Do you organize a meeting to discuss this document? If so, who should
    attend? Do you need a validation of this document and who is authorized to sign
    off? Do all documents need to be signed off or just a few? How much time does
    the customer have before signing off? What are the consequences when they don't

    evaluation moments usually reveal our project's issues and risks. It is very unlikely

    your ability to achieve proactive management will drop significantly. Similarly,
    you will lose your ability for proactive management when you and your team postpone
    all customer interactions to the end of the project life cycle. So, concentrating
    on customer interactions in the beginning and at the end of the project cycle

    themselves. They can remain unnoticed if we do not plan for them. If you want
    to be proactive in your projects, you need to think really hard about what you
    want to measure. A proactive manager reads the impact of the current progress
    on future activities in their projects. You want to know if your current performance
    will cause cost and time overruns and you need to know why. So, if you are using
    an advanced spreadsheet to measure your performance, you need to ask yourself
    if it tells you something about the future of your project or only informs you
    about the past performance of this project. Your measurement can only reveal early
    warning signals when you are not reporting hot air. Your measurement needs to
    be based on the integration of scope, schedule, and cost. So, if you do not have
    a definition of your scope, schedule, and associated costs, you cannot expect

- en: Closing the project proves to be a real challenge for many. At first glance,
    it looks easy and straightforward. After the Go-Live and some additional support,
    you ask the customer to sign off for the delivery of the project, and once signed,
    your project is closed. Unfortunately, most of us have experienced that closing
    usually doesn't go off that smoothly. In fact, many projects remain unclosed forever.

  zh: 对于许多人来说，关闭项目证明是一个真正的挑战。乍一看，这似乎很简单且直接。上线后和一些额外的支持，你要求客户签署项目交付的确认，一旦签署，你的项目就结束了。不幸的是，我们大多数人都有过这样的经历，那就是关闭通常不会那么顺利。事实上，许多项目永远都没有关闭。
- en: The first noticeable finding is that project team members do not have the practice
    of closing. Analysts focus on the delivery of good business process descriptions
    and the capturing of requirements, developers want to show their superior technical
    solutions, and project managers strive for on-time and on-target **Key Performance
    Indicators** (**KPIs**). As a group, their key target is to deploy a new solution,
    followed by a successful Go-Live. This is basically what they have on their radar.
    But who is responsible for working towards closing? Closing is not as self-evident
    for project managers as it is for sales people. Closing is a key element in the
    sales cycle, and being able to close a deal is the key strength of a sales manager.
    They are aware of this crucial process and improve themselves continuously in
    their closing skills. If we want to be more successful at closing our projects,
    we need to start realizing a closing culture within our project teams. Why we
    need to close, how can we facilitate the closing process, and who is responsible
    for closing are some crucial questions we need to find the answers to.

- en: Having defined a project as a temporary endeavor implies closing a project.
    Not closing a project will transition it from a project to an operation. Unfortunately,
    we do not have a budget for that operation, and we probably do not have a defined
    way of managing operations at customer websites either. This can become a true
    burden. If not closed, customers will continue to ask for all kinds of changes,
    enhancements, and various services for which funding will be under discussion.
    You will end up having a lot of meetings trying to find compromises to determine
    what is still within the scope of the project and what is not, and you will need
    to do this for as long as the project isn't closed. Maybe your project was profitable
    until Go-Live, but at this point, your profit is starting to get squeezed dry.
    There are also important psychological elements attached to closing. Successful
    closing reinforces the feeling of success. People need successes in their professional
    careers to stay motivated, and success gives them the incentive to carry on striving
    for ultimate success in their future projects. The customer team members will
    share the sensation of having realized something important for their company,
    and they will share the benefits with the entire organization. And after all of
    the hard work and effort, they are entitled to this moment of glory. When we do
    not close our project, other psychological effects will unfold. With no clear
    end to the tunnel, people will tend to think negatively about the project and
    will feel discouraged.

    and functional designs only when the planned interviews, workshops, and documentation
    activities are finished, and all of the deliverables are generated. This will

    In Project B, the teams may have already started development before the technical
    designs are ready, and there are no real formal evaluation moments planned in

    have difficulties imagining all of the ways events can unfold, and out of sight

    is the use of WBS templates. These are WBSs developed on the basis of previous

    things such as the configuration effort to suit the requirements of the business

    application. In this context, we also evaluate the implementation and business
    complexity, but we sometimes forget to take the organizational complexity into
    consideration. Recent studies have identified that the implementation effort not
    only grows with the number of modules and submodules that are selected for the
    implementation, but that each user also adds an organization component of costs.

    departments invest time in recruiting the right employees, with regards to their
    knowledge and their commitment to the company. Happy employees are usually more
    motivated, and the extent to which they align their motivation with the company's
    goals is linked to your customers' satisfaction. Every employee needs to experience
    success in the daily job. Queuing unclosed and unsuccessful projects is a burden
    gnawing employee motivation. It goes without saying that customer satisfaction
    is also directly connected to your project's success. Solid and effective project
    management practices will significantly increase your project success, which is
    proven and illustrated by many independent consulting surveys and reports. Your
    customers and employees will be much happier when your company develops an implementation
    methodology to such a level that it is a core competency.

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, we went through the emerging and changing aspects of the field
    of project management. We discovered that some basic and essential project management
    techniques can easily make a great difference in our approach to project management.
    Smartly planned project life cycles and phases, along with respecting the phase-based
    approach and simple techniques such as WBS will bring instant value to your project
    services chain. We also learned that by safeguarding the four pillars of project
    success, a solid undercarriage for your project vehicle is guaranteed, which is
    a perfect insurance for bumpy roads. Do not be misled by the skeptics' criticisms
    of project management. We learned that their case is not strong enough to bring
    down the need for project management. However, we must consider and treat the
    implementation of a new methodology as an organizational change management initiative.
