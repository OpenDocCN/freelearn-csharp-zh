- en: Reports are of paramount importance for a developer who wants to create successful
    software. Crystal Reports is an amazing reporting tool because it is compatible
    with Visual Studio and other developing tools. Crystal Reports is compatible with
    a lot of databases and is easy to use. It is a powerful reporting tool and can
    be used to create any report with the least amount of effort. This book is different
    from other technical books because it not only describes the tools and features
    in Crystal Reports and Visual Studio, but also contains a sample application with
    eight reports. Every report has a new idea and teaches the reader a new tool.
    The reader not only learns to create reports but also learns how to display these
    reports in Microsoft Visual Studio applications.
