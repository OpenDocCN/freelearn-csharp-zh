<p>The simplification of code is every developer’s dream. Minimal APIs are a new feature in .NET 6 that aims to simplify code. They are used for building APIs with minimal dependencies in ASP.NET Core. Minimal APIs simplify API development through the use of more compact code syntax. </p>
<p>Developers using minimal APIs will be able to take advantage of this syntax on some occasions to work more quickly with less code and fewer files to maintain. Here, you will be introduced to the main new features of .NET 6 and understand the basic themes of minimal APIs, which weren’t available in .NET 5 and previous versions. You’ll see how to enable Swagger for API documentation, along with CORS, and how to handle application errors. You will learn to structure your code better with Microsoft’s new .NET framework called Dependency Injection. Finally, you will see the performance and benchmarking improvements in .NET 6 that are introduced with minimal APIs.</p>
<p>By the end of this book, you will be able to leverage minimal APIs and understand in what way they are related to the classic development of web APIs.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for .NET developers who want to build .NET and .NET Core APIs and want to study the new features of .NET 6. Basic knowledge of C#, .NET, Visual Studio, and REST APIs is assumed.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B17902_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Minimal APIs</em>, introduces you to the motivations behind introducing minimal APIs within .NET 6. We will explain the main new features of .NET 6 and the work that the .NET team is doing with this latest version. You will come to understand the reasons why we decided to write the book.</p>
<p><a href="B17902_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor023"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring Minimal APIs and Their Advantages</em>, introduces you to the basic ways in which minimal APIs differ from .NET 5 and all previous versions. We will explore in detail routing and serialization with System.Text.JSON. Finally, we will end with some concepts related to writing our first REST API.</p>
<p><a href="B17902_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Minimal APIs</em>, introduces you to the advanced ways in which minimal APIs differ from .NET 5 and all previous versions. We will explore in detail how to enable Swagger for API documentation. We will see how to enable CORS and how to handle application errors.</p>
<p><a href="B17902_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor061"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Dependency Injection in a Minimal API Project</em>, introduces you to Dependency Injection and goes over how to use it with a minimal API.</p>
<p><a href="B17902_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor068"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Logging to Identify Errors</em>, teaches you about the logging tools that .NET provides. A logger is one of the tools that developers have to use to debug an application or understand its failure in production. The logging library has been built into ASP.NET with several features enabled by design.</p>
<p><a href="B17902_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring Validation and Mapping</em>, will teach you how to validate incoming data to an API and how to return any errors or messages. Once the data is validated, it can be mapped to a model that will then be used to process the request.</p>
<p><a href="B17902_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor094"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Integration with the Data Access Layer</em>, helps you understand the best practices for accessing and using data in minimal APIs.</p>
<p><a href="B17902_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor109"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Adding Authentication and Authorization</em>, looks at how to write an authentication and authorization system by leveraging our own database or a cloud service such as Azure Active Directory.</p>
<p><a href="B17902_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor125"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Leveraging Globalization and Localization</em>, shows you how to leverage the translation system in a minimal API project and provide errors in the same language of the client.</p>
<p><a href="B17902_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor140"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Evaluating and Benchmarking the Performance of Minimal APIs</em>, shows the improvements in .NET 6 and those that will be introduced with the minimal APIs.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Conventions used</h1>
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><strong class="source-inline">Code in text</strong>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “In minimal APIs, we define the route patterns using the <strong class="source-inline">Map*</strong> methods of the <strong class="source-inline">WebApplication</strong> object.”</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
app.MapGet("/hello-get", () =&gt; "[GET] Hello World!"); 
app.MapPost("/hello-post", () =&gt; "[POST] Hello World!"); 
app.MapPut("/hello-put", () =&gt; "[PUT] Hello World!"); 
app.MapDelete("/hello-delete", () =&gt; "[DELETE] Hello World!");</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) 
{
<strong class="bold">    app.UseSwagger(); </strong>
<strong class="bold">    app.UseSwaggerUI();</strong> 
}</pre>
