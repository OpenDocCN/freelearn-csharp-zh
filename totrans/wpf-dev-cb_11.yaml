- en: Though **Windows Platform Foundation** (**WPF**) provides a huge set of controls
    with a rich set of features, there can still be chances of various cases when
    you have some **Windows Form** (**WinForm**) controls that are not available in
    WPF. There could be some cases too, when you are porting your WinForm application
    to WPF, where you have no other choice than reusing existing controls and/or forms,
    as the reimplementation will burn huge efforts. So, what needs to be done in such
    cases?

    inside it (whether in a control, a window, or a page). This is called interoperation

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `PropertyGrid` control, part of the .NET Framework, allows you to browse,
    view, and edit the properties of one or more objects. It uses reflection to retrieve
    and display properties of any object or type.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Reflection** is a technology that allows you to retrieve the type information
    at runtime.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are using WinForm, you will be able to use the `PropertyGrid` control
    easily from the control toolbar. But, unfortunately, this control is not available
    in WPF. To use this inside a WPF application, you will need to use the interoperability
    of WPF and WinForm. For this to work, we need to use the `WindowsFormsHost` class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `WindowsFormsHost` class allows you to host a Windows Forms control on a
    WPF page. It is part of the `System.Windows.Forms.Integration` namespace and it
    is available inside the `WindowsFormsIntegration.dll` assembly. That's the reason
    why we had to reference the `System.Windows.Forms` and `WindowsFormsIntegration`
    assemblies inside the project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The default location for the `WindowsFormsIntegration.dll` assembly is `%programfiles%Reference
    AssembliesMicrosoftFrameworkv3.0`, which comes with the other WPF assemblies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the hosting of the WinForm control is successful inside a WPF window, you
    can then set/get its properties. In the preceding example, we assigned the `txtBlock`
    control (which is a WPF control) as the `SelectedObject` property of the `propertyGrid`
    control (which is a WinForm control). Thus, when you run the application, it uses
    reflection to retrieve all the properties exposed by the `TextBlock` control (`txtBlock`)
    and populates those inside the `PropertyGrid` with the default values set to each
    one of them. When you modify a property value at runtime, it changes the associated
    control based on the selection. Hence, you can see a change in the UI of `TextBlock`,
    when you change the `FontSize`, `Foreground`, and other properties.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's more...
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though most of the properties work with `WindowsFormsHost`, there are some limitations
    with **z-order** and transformations when used in a hybrid application. By default,
    the `WindowsFormsHost` elements are drawn on top of other WPF elements, and thus
    there exists no-effect of the z-order property on that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to enable z-ordering, set the `IsRedirected` property of the `WindowsFormsHost`
    to `True`, and the `CompositionMode` property to either `CompositionMode.Full`
    or `CompositionMode.OutputOnly`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the WinForm controls do not support proper scaling and rotating features,
    the `WindowsFormsHost` element does not scale or rotate with other WPF elements.
    To enable these transforming features, such as z-ordering, set the `IsRedirected`
    property to `True` and the `CompositionMode` property to either `CompositionMode.Full`
    or `CompositionMode.OutputOnly`.

    the same to your existing applications. But when you have a large Windows Form
    application project, where you already made a large investment, you won't like
    to reinvest on the same to scrap it and rewrite the entire project in WPF.
