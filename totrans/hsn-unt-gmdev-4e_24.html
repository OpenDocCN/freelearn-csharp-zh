    <p class="normal">Unity has expanded beyond gaming into various fields, such as simulations, training, and app development. In its latest versions, notable improvements in augmented reality (AR) technologies have been introduced. In the latest versions of Unity, we have seen lots of improvements in the field of augmented reality, which allows us to add a layer of virtuality on top of our reality, thereby augmenting what our device can perceive to create games that rely on real-world data, such as the camera’s image, our real-world position, and the current weather. This can also be applied to work environments, such as when viewing the building map or checking the electrical ducts inside a wall. Welcome to the extra section of this book, where we are going to discuss how to create <strong class="screenText">Augmented Reality</strong> (<strong class="screenText">AR</strong>) applications using Unity’s AR Foundation package.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we will examine the following AR Foundation concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Using AR Foundation</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Building for mobile devices</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating a simple AR game</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create AR apps using AR Foundation and will have a fully functional game that uses its framework so that you can test the framework’s capabilities.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by exploring the AR Foundation framework.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-271" class="heading-1">Using AR Foundation</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will examine<a id="_idIndexMarker1329"/> the following AR Foundation concepts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating an AR Foundation project</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Using tracking features</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by discussing how to prepare our project so that it can run AR Foundation apps.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-272" class="heading-2">Creating an AR Foundation project</h2>
    <p class="normal">Transitioning to AR development<a id="_idIndexMarker1330"/> not only changes coding practices but also the game design approach. For instance, in AR, user interaction and camera control are significantly different.</p>
    <p class="normal">Something to consider when creating AR projects is that we will change not only the way we code our game but also the game design aspect. AR apps have differences, especially in the way the user interacts, and also limitations, such as the user being in control of the camera all the time. We cannot simply port an existing game to AR without changing the very core experience of the game. That’s why, in this chapter, we are going to work on a brand-new project; it would be too difficult to change the game we’ve created so far so that it works well in AR.</p>
    <p class="normal">In our case, we are going to create a game<a id="_idIndexMarker1331"/> where the user controls a player moving a “marker,” a physical image you can print that will allow our app to recognize where the player is in the real world. We will be able to move the player while moving that image, and this virtual player will automatically shoot at the nearest enemy. Those enemies will spawn from certain spawn points that the user will need to place in different parts of the home. As an example, we can put two spawn points on the walls and place our player marker on a table in the middle of the room so that the enemies will go toward them. In the following image, you can see a preview of what the game will look like:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.1: Finished game. The Cylinder is an enemy spawner, the Capsule is the enemy, and the Cube is the player. These are positioned in a marker image displayed by the cellphone</p>
    <p class="normal">We’ll start creating a new URP-based project in the same way we created our previous game. Something to consider is that AR Foundation works with other pipelines, including built-in ones, in case you want to use it in already existing projects. If you don’t remember how to create a project or use the Package Manager, please refer to <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Embark on Your Unity Journey</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Once you’re in your new blank project, install the AR Foundation package from the Package Manager, just like we’ve installed other packages previously—that is, from <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Package Manager</strong>. </p>
    <p class="normal">Remember to set the Package Manager so that it shows all packages, not only the ones in the project (the <strong class="screenText">Packages</strong> button at the top-left part of the window needs to be set to <strong class="screenText">Unity Registry</strong>) and also the preview versions (click on the wheel icon, then <strong class="screenText">Project Settings</strong>, and check <strong class="screenText">Enable Pre-release Packages</strong> on the window that appears).</p>
    <p class="normal">At the time of writing this book, the latest stable release is 5.1.0 version. While we use version 5.1.0 of AR Foundation for this example, always check for the most current stable version for your project.</p>
    <p class="normal">As usual, if a warning prompting you to enable the new input system appears, click <strong class="screenText">Yes</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_20_02.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.2: Installing AR Foundation</p>
    <p class="normal">Before we install any other needed packages, now is a good moment to discuss some core ideas of the AR Foundation framework. This package, by itself, does nothing; it defines a series of AR features that mobile devices offer, such as image tracking, cloud points, and object tracking, but the actual implementation of how to do that is contained in the <strong class="screenText">Provider</strong> packages, such as the <strong class="screenText">Apple ARKit XR Plugin</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Google ARCore XR plugin</strong> packages. This is designed like this because, depending on the target device you want to work with, the way those features are implemented changes. As an example, in iOS, Unity implements those features using ARKit, while in Android, it uses ARCore; they are platform-specific frameworks. Remember to install the same version of these platform packages as the AR Foundation one (5.0.0 preview 13 in this case).</p>
    <p class="normal">Something to consider here is that not all iOS<a id="_idIndexMarker1332"/> or Android devices support AR Foundation apps. You might find an updated list of supported devices when searching for ARCore- and ARKit-supported devices on the internet. At the time<a id="_idIndexMarker1333"/> of writing, the following links provide<a id="_idIndexMarker1334"/> the supported devices lists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">iOS</strong>: <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/augmented-reality"><span class="url">https://www.apple.com/lae/augmented-reality</span></a> (at the bottom of the page)</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Android</strong>: <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/devices"><span class="url">https://developers.google.com/ar/devices</span></a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Also, there isn’t a PC provider package, so the only way to test AR Foundation apps so far is directly on the device, but testing tools are going to be released soon. In my case, I will be creating an app for iOS, so aside from the <strong class="screenText">AR Foundation</strong> package, I need to install the <strong class="screenText">ARKit XR</strong> plugin.</p>
    <p class="normal">However, if you want to develop for Android, install the <strong class="screenText">ARCore XR</strong> plugin instead (or both if you’re targeting both platforms). Also, I will be using the 5.1.1 version of these packages. Usually, the versions of the <strong class="screenText">AR Foundation</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Provider</strong> packages match but apply the same logic as when you picked the <strong class="screenText">AR Foundation</strong> version.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have the needed plugins, we need to prepare a scene for AR as follows:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Create a new Scene in <strong class="screenText">File | New Scene</strong> and select the <strong class="screenText">Basic (URP)</strong> template.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Delete the <strong class="screenText">Main Camera</strong>; we are going to use a different one.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">GameObject | XR</strong> menu, create an <strong class="screenText">AR Session</strong> GameObject.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">In the same menu, create an <strong class="screenText">XR Origin (Mobile AR)</strong> object that has a <strong class="screenText">Camera</strong> inside it.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Select <strong class="screenText">Main Camera</strong> inside <strong class="screenText">XR Origin</strong>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Set the <strong class="screenText">Render Mode</strong> property of the <strong class="screenText">AR Camera Manager</strong> component to <strong class="screenText">After Opaques</strong>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Your hierarchy should look as follows:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_20_03.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with medium confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.3: Starter AR Scene</p>
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">AR Session</strong> object will be responsible<a id="_idIndexMarker1335"/> for initializing the AR framework and will handle all the update logic for the AR systems. The <strong class="screenText">XR Origin</strong> object will allow the framework to locate tracked objects, such as images and point clouds, in a relative position to the scene. The devices inform the positions of tracked objects relative to what the device considers “the origin.” This is usually the first area of your house you were pointing at when the app started detecting objects, so the <strong class="screenText">XR Origin</strong> object will represent that point in your physical space. Finally, you can check the camera inside the origin, which contains some extra components, the most important being the <strong class="screenText">Tracked Pose Driver</strong>, which will make your <strong class="screenText">Camera</strong> object move along with your device. Since the device’s position is relative to the Session Origin object’s point, the camera needs to be inside the origin object.</p>
    <p class="normal">One extra step in case you are working on a URP project (our case) is that you need to set up the render pipeline so that it supports rendering the camera image in the app. To do that, go to the <code class="inlineCode">Settings</code> folder that was generated when we created the project, look for the <code class="inlineCode">URP-HighFidelity-Renderer</code> file, and select it. In the <strong class="screenText">Renderer Features</strong> list, click the <strong class="screenText">Add Renderer Feature</strong> button and select <strong class="screenText">AR Background Renderer Feature</strong>. In the following screenshot, you can see what the Forward Renderer asset should look like:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_20_04.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with low confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.4: Adding support for URP</p>
    <p class="normal">And that’s all! We are ready to start exploring<a id="_idIndexMarker1336"/> the AR Foundation components so that we can implement tracking features.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-273" class="heading-2">Using tracking features</h2>
    <p class="normal">For our project, we are going<a id="_idIndexMarker1337"/> to need two of the most common tracking<a id="_idIndexMarker1338"/> features in AR (but not the only ones): image recognition and plane detection. The first one consists of detecting the position in the real world of a specific image so that we can place digital objects on top of it, such as the player. The second one, plane detection, consists of recognizing real-life surfaces, such as floors, tables, and walls, so that we have a reference of where we can put objects, such as the enemy’s spawn points. Only horizontal and vertical surfaces are recognized (just vertical surfaces on some devices).</p>
    <p class="normal">The first thing we need to do is tell our app which images it needs to detect, as follows:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Add an image to the project that you can print or display on a mobile device. Having a way to display the image in the real world is necessary to test this. In this case, I will use the following image:
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_20_05.png" alt="A picture containing gravel, pebble, rock, rubble  Description automatically generated"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.5: Image to track</p>
    <p class="normal">Try to get an image that contains as many features as you can. This means an image with lots of little details, such as contrasts, sharp corners, and so on. Those are what our AR systems use to detect it; the more detail, the better the recognition. If your device has trouble detecting our current image, try other images (the classic QR code might help).</p></li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="2">Consider that some devices might have trouble with certain images, such as the image suggested in this book. If this generates issues when testing, please try using another one. You will be testing this on your device in the upcoming sections of this chapter, so just keep this in mind.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Create a <strong class="screenText">Reference Image Library</strong>, an asset containing all the images we wish our app to recognize, by clicking the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> button in <strong class="screenText">Project Panel</strong> and selecting <strong class="screenText">XR | Reference Image Library</strong>:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_20_06.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.6: Creating a Reference Image Library</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="4">Select the <strong class="screenText">Reference Image Library</strong> asset we created<a id="_idIndexMarker1339"/> and click the <strong class="screenText">Add Image</strong> button to add a new image<a id="_idIndexMarker1340"/> to the library.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Drag the texture to the texture slot (the one that says <strong class="screenText">None</strong>).</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Turn <strong class="screenText">Specify Size</strong> on and set <strong class="screenText">Physical Size</strong> to the size that your image will be printed in, in real life, in meters. Try to be accurate here; on some devices, not having this value right might result in the image not being tracked:</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.7: Adding an image to be recognized</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we’ve specified the images to be detected, let’s test this by placing a cube on top of the real-life image:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Create a Prefab of a cube and add the <strong class="screenText">AR Tracked Image</strong> component to it.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Remember to set a small scale, like <code class="inlineCode">0.1</code>, on each axis, given that the default cube will be 1 meter by 1 meter, which will be huge in AR.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Add the <strong class="screenText">AR Tracked Image Manager</strong> component to the <strong class="screenText">XR Origin </strong>object. This will be responsible for detecting images and creating objects in their position.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Drag the <strong class="screenText">Image Library</strong> asset created in the previous steps to the <strong class="screenText">Serialized Library</strong> property of the component to specify the images to recognize.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Drag the <strong class="screenText">Cube</strong> Prefab to the <strong class="screenText">Tracked Image Prefab</strong> property of the component:</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.8: Setting up Tracked Image Manager</p>
    <p class="normal">And that’s all! Later, in the <em class="italic">Building for mobile</em> section in this chapter, when<a id="_idIndexMarker1341"/> we create an iOS or Android<a id="_idIndexMarker1342"/> build, we will see a cube spawning in the same position that the image is located in in the real world. Remember that you need to test this on the device, which we will do in the next section, so for now, let’s keep coding our test app:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_20_09.png" alt="A computer on a table  Description automatically generated with low confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.9: Cube located on top of the image being displayed by the cellphone</p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s also prepare our app so that it can detect and display the plane surfaces the camera has recognized. This is simply done by adding the <strong class="screenText">AR Plane Manager</strong> component to the <strong class="screenText">XR Origin </strong>object.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_20_10.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.10: Adding the AR Plane Manager component</p>
    <p class="normal">This component will detect surface planes<a id="_idIndexMarker1343"/> over our house as we move the camera<a id="_idIndexMarker1344"/> over it. It can take a while to detect them, so it’s important to visualize the detected areas to get feedback about this to ensure it’s working properly. We can manually get information about the plane from a component reference to AR Plane Manager, but luckily, Unity allows us to visualize planes easily. Let’s take a look:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Create a Prefab of a plane, first by creating the plane in <strong class="screenText">GameObject | 3D Object | Plane</strong>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Add a <strong class="screenText">Line Renderer</strong> to it. This will allow us to draw a line over the edges of the detected areas.<div class="note">

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.14: Setting the plane visualization Prefab</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, we have a way to see the planes, but seeing them is not the only thing we can do (sometimes, we don’t even want them to be visible). The real power of planes resides in placing virtual objects on top of real-life surfaces, tapping into a specific plane area, and getting its real-life position. We can access the plane data using <strong class="screenText">AR Plane Manager</strong> or by accessing the <strong class="screenText">AR Plane</strong> component of our visualization planes, but something easier is to use the <strong class="screenText">AR Raycast Manager</strong> component.</p>
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">AR Raycast Manager</strong> component provides us with the equivalent of the <code class="inlineCode">Physics.Raycast</code> function of the Unity Physics system, which, as you may recall, is used to create imaginary rays that start from one position and go in a specified direction in order to make them hit surfaces and detect the exact hit point. The version provided by <strong class="screenText">AR Raycast Manager</strong>, instead of colliding with physics colliders, collides with tracked objects, mostly point clouds (we are not using them) and the “planes” we are tracking. We can test this feature by following these steps:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Add the <strong class="screenText">AR Raycast Manager</strong> component to the <strong class="screenText">XR Origin </strong>object.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Create a custom script called <code class="inlineCode">SpawnerPlacer</code> in the <strong class="screenText">XR Origin </strong>object.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Awake</strong> cache, add the reference to <code class="inlineCode">ARRaycastManager</code>. You will need to add the <code class="inlineCode">using UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation;</code> line to the top of the script for this class to be usable in our script.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Create a private field of the <code class="inlineCode">List&lt;ARRaycastHit&gt;</code> type and instantiate it; the Raycast function is going to detect every plane our ray hit, not just the first one:</li>

      <li class="numberedList">Inside the <code class="inlineCode">if</code> statement from the previous step, add another condition for calling the <code class="inlineCode">Raycast</code> function of <strong class="screenText">AR Raycast Manager</strong>, passing the position of the touch as the first parameter and the list of hits as the second (<code class="inlineCode">Touchscreen.current.primaryTouch.position.ReadValue()</code>).</li>

    <p class="normal">In this section, we learned how to create a new AR project using AR Foundation. We discussed how to install and set up the framework, as well as how to detect real-life image positions and surfaces and then how to place objects on top of them.</p>
    <p class="normal">As you may have noticed, we never <a id="_idIndexMarker1354"/>hit <strong class="screenText">Play</strong> to test this, and sadly, at the time of writing<a id="_idIndexMarker1355"/> this book, we cannot test this in the Editor. Instead, we need to test this directly on the device. Due to this, in the next section, we are going to learn how to do builds for mobile devices such as Android and iOS.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-274" class="heading-1">Building for mobile devices</h1>
    <p class="normal">Unity is a very powerful tool that solves <a id="_idIndexMarker1356"/>the most common problems in game development very easily, and one of them is building the game for several target platforms. Now, the Unity part of building our project for such devices is easy to do, but each device has its non-Unity-related nuances when installing development builds. In order to test our AR app, we need to test it directly on the device. So, let’s explore how we can make our app run on Android and iOS, the most common mobile platforms.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p class="normal">Before diving into this topic, it is worth mentioning that the following procedures change a lot over time, so you will need to find<a id="_idIndexMarker1357"/> the latest instructions on the internet.

    <p class="normal">To build an app on Android, there are some requirements we need to meet, such as having the Java SDK (not the regular Java runtime) and Android SDK installed, but luckily, the new versions of Unity take care of that. Just to double-check that we have installed the needed dependencies, follow these steps:</p>

    <p class="normal">Now, you can finally build the app<a id="_idIndexMarker1367"/> from <strong class="screenText">File | Build Settings</strong>, as usual, by using<a id="_idIndexMarker1368"/> the <strong class="screenText">Build</strong> button. This time, the output will be a single APK file that you can install by copying the file to your device and opening it. Remember that in order to install APKs that weren’t downloaded from the Play Store, you need to set your device to <strong class="screenText">Install Unknown Apps</strong>. The location for that option varies a lot, depending on the Android version and the device you are using, but this option is usually located in the <strong class="screenText">Security</strong> settings. Some Android versions prompt you to view these settings when installing the APK.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, we can copy and install the generated APK build file every time we want to create a build. However, we can let Unity do that for us using the <strong class="screenText">Build and Run</strong> button. This option, after building the app, will look for the first Android device connected to your computer via USB and will automatically install the app. For this to work, we need to prepare our device and PC as follows:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">On your device, find the build number in the <strong class="screenText">Settings</strong> section of the device, whose location, again, can change depending on the device.

      <li class="numberedList">Install the USB drivers<a id="_idIndexMarker1369"/> from your phone manufacturer’s site <a id="_idIndexMarker1370"/>onto your computer if using Windows.

Also, if you can’t find that, you can look for <code class="inlineCode">Android USB Driver</code> to get the generic drivers, but that might not work if your device manufacturer has their own. On Mac, this step is usually not necessary.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Connect your device (or reconnect it if it’s already connected). The <strong class="screenText">Allow USB Debugging</strong> option for your computer will appear on the device.

      <li class="numberedList">In Unity, build with the <strong class="screenText">Build and Run</strong> button, and save the <code class="inlineCode">apk</code> into a folder. Be patient because this will take a while the first time.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Please remember to try another image if you have trouble detecting the image where we instantiate the player (the Unity logo, in my case). This might vary a lot, according to your device’s capabilities.</p>
    <p class="normal">And that’s all! Now that you have<a id="_idIndexMarker1371"/> your app running<a id="_idIndexMarker1372"/> on your device, let’s learn how to do the same for the iOS platform.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-276" class="heading-2">Building for iOS</h2>
    <p class="normal">Developing for iOS involves<a id="_idIndexMarker1373"/> certain costs and requirements. This includes using Xcode, which is available<a id="_idIndexMarker1374"/> only on macOS, and potentially acquiring a Mac device and an iOS device. Also, while an Apple Developer account, costing 99 USD per year, is necessary for releasing games, it’s optional for testing purposes.</p>
    <p class="normal">To create an AR Foundation iOS build, you should do the following:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Get a Mac computer and an iOS device.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Create an Apple Developer<a id="_idIndexMarker1375"/> account (at the time of writing this book, you can create one at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/"><span class="url">https://developer.apple.com/</span></a>).</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Install the latest version of Xcode from the App Store onto your Mac.</li>

    </ol>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we discussed how to build a Unity project that can run on iOS and Android, thus allowing us to create<a id="_idIndexMarker1380"/> mobile apps—AR mobile<a id="_idIndexMarker1381"/> apps, specifically. Like any build, there are methods we can follow to profile and debug, as we saw when we looked at PC builds, but we are not going to discuss that here. Now that we have discussed the building process for iOS, let’s shift our focus to the exciting task of creating a simple AR game. We’ll start by developing the core gameplay mechanics, including spawning players and enemies.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-277" class="heading-1">Creating a simple AR game</h1>
    <p class="normal">As we discussed previously, the idea<a id="_idIndexMarker1382"/> is to create a simple game where we can move our player while moving a real-life image and also put in some enemy spawners by just tapping where we want them to be, such as a wall, the floor, a table, and so on. Our player will automatically shoot at the nearest enemy, and the enemies will shoot directly at the player, so our only task will be to move the player so that they avoid bullets. We are going to implement these game mechanics using scripts very similar to the ones we used in this book’s main project.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will develop the following AR game features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Spawning the player and enemies</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Coding the player and enemy behavior</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">First, we are going to discuss how<a id="_idIndexMarker1383"/> to make our players and enemies appear in the app, specifically in real-world positions, and then we will make them move and shoot each other to create the specified gameplay mechanics. Let’s start with <strong class="screenText">spawning</strong>.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-278" class="heading-2">Spawning the player and enemies</h2>
    <p class="normal">Your <strong class="screenText">Player</strong> Prefab<a id="_idIndexMarker1384"/> should look as follows:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_20_32.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.32: The starting “Player” Prefab</p>
    <p class="normal">The enemies will require<a id="_idIndexMarker1385"/> a little bit more work, as shown here:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Create a Prefab called <code class="inlineCode">Spawner</code> with the graphic you want your spawner to have (in my case, a cylinder) and its real-life size (small scale).</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Add a custom script that spawns a Prefab every few seconds, such as the one shown in the following screenshot.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">You will notice the usage of <code class="inlineCode">Physics.IgnoreCollision</code> to prevent<a id="_idIndexMarker1386"/> the <code class="inlineCode">Spawner</code> GameObject from colliding with<a id="_idIndexMarker1387"/> the spawned GameObject, getting the colliders of both objects and passing them to the function. You can also use the <strong class="screenText">Layer Collision Matrix </strong>to prevent collisions, just like we did in this book’s main project, if you prefer to:</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.33: Spawner script</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="4">Create an <code class="inlineCode">Enemy</code> Prefab with the desired graphic (a capsule, in my case) and a <code class="inlineCode">Rigidbody</code> component with the <strong class="screenText">Is Kinematic</strong> checkbox checked. This way, the enemy will move, but not with physics. Remember to consider the real-life size of the enemy.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Set the <strong class="screenText">Prefab</strong> property of <strong class="screenText">Spawner</strong> so that it spawns our enemy at our desired time frequency:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_20_34.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.34: Configuring Spawner</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="6">Set the Prefab of <code class="inlineCode">SpawnerPlacer</code> in the XR Origin object so that it spawns the <strong class="screenText">Spawner</strong> Prefab we created earlier.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">And that’s all for the first part. If you test the game<a id="_idIndexMarker1388"/> now, you will be able to tap on the detected planes<a id="_idIndexMarker1389"/> in the app and see how the spawner starts creating enemies. You can also look at the target image and see our cube player appear.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have the objects in the scene, let’s make them do something more interesting, starting with the enemies.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-279" class="heading-2">Coding the player and enemy behavior</h2>
    <p class="normal">The enemy must move toward the player<a id="_idIndexMarker1390"/> in order to shoot at them, so it will need to have access <a id="_idIndexMarker1391"/>to the player’s position. Since the enemy is instantiated, we cannot drag the player reference to the Prefab. However, the player has also been instantiated, so we can add a PlayerManager script to the player that uses the Singleton pattern. Remember, the Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a script exists within a game, a concept we covered in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Victory or Defeat: Win and Lose Conditions)</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">To do that, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Create a <code class="inlineCode">PlayerManager</code> script similar to the one shown in the following screenshot and add it to the player:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.35: Creating the PlayerManager script</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="2">Now that the enemy has a reference<a id="_idIndexMarker1392"/> to the player, let’s make them look at the player <a id="_idIndexMarker1393"/>by adding a <code class="inlineCode">LookAtPlayer</code> script, as shown here:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_20_36.png" alt="A screenshot of a computer program  Description automatically generated with low confidence"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 20.36: Creating the LookAtPlayer script</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="3">Also, add a simple <code class="inlineCode">MoveForward</code> script like the one shown in the following screenshot to make the <strong class="screenText">enemy</strong> not only look at the player but also move toward them. Since the <code class="inlineCode">LookAtPlayer</code> script is making the enemy face the player, this script moving along the <em class="italic">Z </em>axis is just enough:</li>

    <p class="normal">Now, we will take care of the player<a id="_idIndexMarker1394"/> movement. Remember that our player is controlled by moving<a id="_idIndexMarker1395"/> the image, so here, we are actually referring to the rotation since the player will need to automatically look and shoot at the nearest enemy. To do this, follow these steps:</p>

    <p class="normal">And that’s all! As you can see, we basically created a new game using almost the same scripts we used in the main game, mostly because we designed them to be generic (and the game genres are almost the same). Of course, this project <a id="_idIndexMarker1404"/>could be improved a lot, but we have a nice base project<a id="_idIndexMarker1405"/> to create amazing AR apps.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-280" class="heading-1">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we introduced the AR Foundation Unity framework, explored how to set it up, and how to implement several tracking features so that we can position virtual objects on top of real-life objects. We also discussed how to build our project so that it can run on both iOS and Android platforms, which is the only way we can test our AR apps at the time of writing. Finally, we created a simple AR game based on the game we created in the main project but modified it so that it’s suitable for use in AR scenarios.</p>
    <p class="normal">With this new knowledge, you will be able to start your path as an AR app developer, creating apps that augment real objects with virtual objects by detecting the positions of the real objects. This can be applied to games, training apps, and simulations. You may even be able to find new fields of usage, so take advantage of this new technology and its new possibilities!</p>
    <p class="normal">Well, this is the end of this journey through Unity 2023. We are really glad you reached this point in the book. We hope this knowledge will help you to improve or start your game development career with one of the most versatile and powerful tools on the market: Unity. We hope to see your creations someday! See you on the road!</p>
