		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-239"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Chapter 14</em>: Full Unity Programmer Mock Exam</h1>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Welcome to the Full Unity Programmer Mock Exam. Here, we will provide a series of multiple-choice questions, similar to the ones you have been answering at the end of every few chapters in this book.</p>
			<p>Try your best and see how it goes – the idea is to get <strong class="bold">all</strong> of the questions right. If and when you complete this mock exam, you will be ready to go ahead with the real Unity Programmer exam. If, for any reason, you get a question wrong, go back through this book or Google to try and find the answer. Try to avoid skipping to the answer in the <a href="B18381_Appendix_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor245"><em class="italic">Appendix</em></a>; use your knowledge more than muscle memory. It's important you understand the question so that you can answer it. These mock questions are only examples of the kinds of questions you will get in the exam.</p>
			<p>I recommend reading every question at least twice; sometimes, exam questions will try to catch you out through how the questions are worded. The exam will also try and take your time away by making you read a long piece of code, which isn't really required.</p>
			<p>The exam is timed, but you should have enough time to answer each multiple-choice question. It's probably best to keep some personal time aside for when you start and finish this mock exam. If you are struggling with a question, skip it and come back to it later. Sometimes, it's easier to do the exam questions in sweeps to get the easier ones out of the way. If you are still struggling, I have marked, in brackets at the end of each question, the chapter/<a href="B18381_Appendix_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor245"><em class="italic">Appendix</em></a> you can get more information from.</p>
			<p>So, take your time, don't get caught out with the wording, and proceed... If you enjoy it, that's also a bonus!</p>

				<li>You have been asked by your head of development to make it so whenever a player walks through a doorway, a light next to the door will turn on.

				<li value="16">You have been assigned a task from your technical lead to store the 800 <strong class="bold">non-player character</strong> (<strong class="bold">NPC</strong>) prefabs. Either one of these prefabs can be picked and dropped into the game to roam around.

				<li value="20">When would we use a trigger instead of just a collider? (CH2)<ol><li>When a character is sitting in a health zone charging their energy.</li><li>If two game objects collide but we only want to set our particle effects manually.</li><li>Only if we need to alter our <code>Rigidbody</code> settings during runtime.</li><li>Whenever multiple colliders are children of another collider.</li></ol></li>
				<li>You are making a sci-fi arcade shooter game. The gamer's view has a UI display wrapped around the screen with lots of vital details about our mission and our ship's health. In the lower corner of the screen, we have a 3D view of the condition of our ship. Whenever the ship takes damage, we can see the results in our 3D view, along with particle effects to emphasize the damage. Each possible damage point on the ship in the 3D view has a collider that reacts if a missile hits it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In testing, you realize the ship in the 3D view has enemy missiles bouncing off your colliders when they're supposed to be damaging your ship.</p>
			<p>How should the programmer solve this issue while retaining the functionality of both the in-game objects and the UI? (CH13)</p>

			</ol>
			<ol>
				<li value="22">You have moved studios and jumped on a new game project where you are in a desert defending a fort from 6,000 donkeys charging to destroy your civilization. Your only line of defense is throwing heavy wet bean bags to tire the donkeys out. To target each donkey, you use a raycast system that makes contact with the mesh collider on either donkey. Your head of development has now requested 20,000 donkeys to up the ante. You are now starting to notice the performance of the game has drastically dropped. Everyone on the team is making an effort so that all 20,000 donkeys are in the game. </li>
