<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-265">Interacting with Data in C# – Entity Framework Core</h1>
<p class="normal">As we mentioned in <em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Different Domains in Software Solutions</em>, software systems are organized into layers that communicate with each other through interfaces and classes that don’t depend on how the peculiarities of each layer are implemented. When the software is a business/enterprise system, it usually contains at least three layers: the data layer, the business layer, and the presentation layer, if the software is based on a classical layer architecture (see the <em class="italic">Classic layers architecture</em> section of <em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">If, instead, the application is based on an onion architecture, an outermost layer contains presentation logic, drivers, and testing logic, then there is an application layer, and finally, a domain layer (see the <em class="italic">Onion architecture</em> section of <em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>). While, in the onion architecture, layers are defined in a slightly different way, the functionalities of the three layers of the onion architecture are basically the same as the ones of the three layers of the classical layer architecture.</p>
<p class="normal">However, notwithstanding the differences among all possible architectural choices, experience has proved that the main functionalities needed to handle data efficaciously are quite standard.</p>
<p class="normal">More specifically, in all architectures described in <em class="italic">Chapter 7</em><em class="italic">, </em>data-processing layers have the main purpose of mapping data from a data storage subsystem into objects and vice versa.</p>
<p class="normal">In the case of the classical data layer, these objects are plain objects with no methods, while in the case of the domain layer, they are rich objects whose methods implement the application’s domain logic. Data layers, instead, implement the application’s domain logic within repository classes that are associated with their plain objects (see the <em class="italic">The Repository and Unit of Work patterns</em> section of <em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>).</p>
<p class="normal">This led to the conception of general-purpose frameworks for implementing data layers in a substantially declarative way. These tools are called <strong class="keyWord">Object-Relational Mapping </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">ORM</strong>) tools since they are data storage subsystems based on relational databases. However, they also work well with modern non-relational storage classified as NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB and Azure Cosmos DB) since their data model is closer to the target object model than a purely relational model.</p>
<p class="normal">ORMs improve and simplify the whole development process since they factor out and take away the burden of mapping data into objects and vice versa, so developers can focus just on the peculiarity of the business domain.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Understanding ORM basics</li>
<li class="bulletList">Configuring Entity Framework Core</li>

<li class="bulletList">Understanding Entity Framework Core advanced features</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">This chapter describes ORMs and how to configure them, and then focuses on Entity Framework Core, the ORM included in .NET 8.</p>
<p class="normal">Before delving into ORM basics, let’s look at the technical requirements needed to follow the practical examples in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-266">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">This chapter requires the free Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition or better with all the database tools installed.</p>
<p class="normal">All the concepts in this chapter will be clarified with practical examples. You will find the code for this chapter at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Software-Architecture-with-C-Sharp-12-and-.NET-8-4E">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Software-Architecture-with-C-Sharp-12-and-.NET-8-4E</a>.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-267">Understanding ORM basics</h1>
<p class="normal">ORMs map <a id="_idIndexMarker914"/>relational DB tables into in-memory collections of objects where object properties correspond to DB table columns. Types from C#, such as Booleans, numeric types, and strings, have corresponding DB types. If GUIDs are not available in the mapped DB, then types such as GUIDs are mapped to their equivalent string representations. All date and time types are mapped either to C# <code class="inlineCode">DateTime</code> when the date/time contains no time zone information, to <code class="inlineCode">DateTimeOffset</code> when the date/time also contains explicit time zone information, to <code class="inlineCode">DateOnly</code> when the type contains just date information, or to <code class="inlineCode">TimeOnly</code> when the type contains just time information. Any DB time duration is mapped to a <code class="inlineCode">TimeSpan</code>. Finally, single characters should not be mapped at all to DB fields.</p>
<p class="normal">Since the string properties of most object-oriented languages have no length limits associated with them (while DB string fields usually have length limits), the DB limits are taken into account in the DB mapping configuration. In general, when the mapping between DB types and object-oriented language types needs options to be specified, these options are declared in the mapping configuration.</p>
<p class="normal">The way the whole configuration is defined depends on the specific ORM. Entity Framework Core offers three options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Data annotations (property attributes)</li>
<li class="bulletList">Name conventions</li>
<li class="bulletList">A fluent configuration interface based on configuration objects and methods</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">While the fluent interface can be used to specify any configuration option, the data annotations and name conventions can be used for a smaller subset of them.</p>
<p class="normal">Personally, I prefer using the fluent interface for most settings. I use name conventions only for specifying the principal key with an ID property name since I find that relying on name conventions for more complex settings is very dangerous. In fact, there are no compilation-time checks on name conventions, so a re-engineering operation might erroneously change or destroy some ORM settings.</p>
<p class="normal">I use data annotations mainly for specifying constraints on the possible values of properties, such as the maximum length of a value or the fact that a property is obligatory and can’t be null. In fact, these constraints restrict the type specified in each property, so placing them next to the properties they are applied to increases the code’s readability.</p>
<p class="normal">All other <a id="_idIndexMarker915"/>settings are better grouped and organized by using the fluent interface in order to increase code readability and maintainability.</p>
<p class="normal">Each ORM adapts to a specific DB type (Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and so on) with DB-specific adapters <a id="_idIndexMarker916"/>called <strong class="keyWord">providers</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">connectors</strong>. Entity Framework Core has providers<a id="_idIndexMarker917"/> for most of the available DB engines.</p>
<p class="normal">A complete list of<a id="_idIndexMarker918"/> providers can be found at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/ef/core/providers/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/ef/core/providers/</a>.</p>
<p class="normal">Adapters are necessary for the differences in DB types, for the way transactions are handled, and for all other features that are not standardized by the SQL language.</p>
<p class="normal">Relationships among tables are represented with object pointers. For instance, in a one-to-many relationship, the class that’s mapped to the <em class="italic">one</em> side of the relationship contains a collection that is populated with the related objects on the <em class="italic">many</em> side of the relationship. On the other hand, the class mapped to the <em class="italic">many</em> side of the relationship has a simple property that is populated with a uniquely related object on the <em class="italic">one</em> side of the relationship.</p>
<p class="normal">While, in the case of a one-to-one relationship, both classes have a property populated with the companion object, in the case of many-to-many relationships, both classes contain a collection that is populated with the related objects.</p>
<p class="normal">The whole database (or just a part of it) is represented by an in-memory cache class that contains a collection for each mapped DB table. First, the query and update operations are performed on an instance of an in-memory cache class, and then this instance is synchronized with the database.</p>
<p class="normal">The in-memory cache class that’s used by Entity Framework Core is called <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> and it also contains the mapping configuration.</p>
<p class="normal">Developers can customize the <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> class furnished by Entity Framework Core by inheriting from it and by adding their database-mapping instructions inside overridden methods.</p>
<p class="normal">Summing up, <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> subclass instances contain partial snapshots of the DB that are synchronized with the database to get/update the actual data.</p>
<p class="normal">DB queries are performed with a query language made of method calls on the collections of the in-memory cache class. The actual SQL is created and executed during the synchronization stage. For instance, Entity Framework Core performs <strong class="keyWord">Language Integrated Query</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">LINQ</strong>) queries<a id="_idIndexMarker919"/> on the collections mapped to the DB tables.</p>
<p class="normal">In general, LINQ queries <a id="_idIndexMarker920"/>produce <code class="inlineCode">IEnumerable</code> instances, that is, collections whose elements are not computed when the is created at the end of the query, but when you actually attempt to retrieve the collection elements from the. This is called lazy evaluation or deferred execution. It works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">LINQ queries that start from a mapped collection of a <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> create a specific subtype of <code class="inlineCode">IEnumerable</code> called <code class="inlineCode">IQueryable</code>.</li>
<li class="bulletList">An <code class="inlineCode">IQueryable</code> contains all the information that’s needed to issue a query to the database, but the actual SQL is produced and executed when the first element of the <code class="inlineCode">IQueryable</code> is retrieved.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Typically, each Entity Framework query ends with a <code class="inlineCode">ToListAsync</code> or <code class="inlineCode">ToArrayAsync</code> operation that transforms the <code class="inlineCode">IQueryable</code> into a list or array, thereby causing the actual execution of the query on the database.</li>
<li class="bulletList">If the query is expected to return just a single element or no element at all, we typically execute a <code class="inlineCode">SingleOrDefaultAsync</code> operation that returns a single element, if any, or <code class="inlineCode">null</code>. This operation may be used also when several results are expected but we need just one. In this case, we might also use <code class="inlineCode">LastOrDefaultAsync</code>.</li>
<li class="bulletList">If we need just to count the total results, for instance, for adequately organizing paging information, we can use <code class="inlineCode">CountAsync()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Also, updates, deletions, and the addition of new entities to a DB table are performed by mimicking these operations on a <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> collection property that represents the database table. However, entities may only be updated or deleted this way after they have been loaded in that memory collection by means of a query. Typically, an update query requires the in-memory representation of the entity to be modified as needed, while a delete query requires the in-memory representation of the entity to be removed from its in-memory mapped collection. In Entity Framework Core, the removal operation is performed by calling the <code class="inlineCode">Remove(entity)</code> method of the collection.</p>
<p class="normal">The addition of a new entity has no further requirements. It is enough to add the new entity to the in-memory collection. Updates, deletions, and additions that are performed on various in-memory collections are actually passed to the database with an explicit call to a DB synchronization method.</p>
<p class="normal">For instance, Entity Framework Core passes all the changes that are performed on a <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> instance to the database when you call the <code class="inlineCode">DbContext.SaveChangesAsync()</code> method.</p>
<p class="normal">Changes<a id="_idIndexMarker921"/> that are passed to the database during a synchronization operation are executed in a single transaction. Moreover, for ORMs, such as Entity Framework Core, that have an explicit representation of transactions, if a synchronization operation is executed in the scope of a transaction then it uses that transaction instead of creating a new transaction.</p>
<p class="normal">The remaining sections in this chapter explain how to use Entity Framework Core, along with some example code based on this book’s WWTravelClub use case.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-268">Configuring Entity Framework Core</h1>
<p class="normal">Since, as <a id="_idIndexMarker922"/>detailed in <em class="italic">Chapter 7, Understanding the Different Domains in Software Solutions</em>, database handling is confined within a dedicated application layer, it is good practice to define your Entity Framework Core (<code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code>) in a separate library. Accordingly, we need to define a .NET class library project.</p>
<p class="normal">We have two different kinds of library projects: <strong class="keyWord">.NET Standard</strong> and <strong class="keyWord">.NET Core</strong>. Please refer to<em class="italic"> Chapter 5, Implementing Code Reusability in C# 12,</em> for a discussion on the various kinds of libraries.</p>
<p class="normal">While .NET libraries <a id="_idIndexMarker923"/>are tied to a specific .NET Core version, .NET Standard 2.0 libraries have a wide range of applications since they work with any .NET <a id="_idIndexMarker924"/>version greater than 2.0 and also with the old .NET Framework 4.7 and above.</p>
<p class="normal">Since our library is not a general-purpose library (it’s just a component of a specific .NET 8 application), instead of choosing a .NET Standard library project, we can simply choose a .NET 8 library. Our .NET 8 library project can be created and prepared as follows:</p>
<ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open Visual Studio, click <strong class="screenText">Create new project</strong> and then select <strong class="screenText">Class Library</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Name the new project <code class="inlineCode">WWTravelClubDB</code> and accept the same name for the whole Visual Studio solution.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the window that follows, choose .NET 8 as the target framework.</li>
<li class="numberedList">We must install all Entity Framework Core-related dependencies. The simplest way to have all the necessary dependencies installed is to add the NuGet package for the provider of the database engine we are going to use – in our case, SQL Server – as we mentioned in <em class="italic">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Deciding on the Best Cloud-Based Solution</em>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In fact, any <a id="_idIndexMarker925"/>provider will install all the required packages since it has all of them as dependencies. So, let’s add the latest stable version of <code class="inlineCode">Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer</code>. If you plan to use several database engines, you can also add other providers since they can work side by side. Later in this chapter, we will install other NuGet packages that contain tools that we need to process our Entity Framework Core configuration.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Let’s rename the default <code class="inlineCode">Class1</code> class to <code class="inlineCode">MainDbContext</code>. The <code class="inlineCode">Class1</code> class is automatically added to the class library. Now, let’s replace its content with the following code:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
namespace WWTravelClubDB
{
    public class MainDbContext: DbContext
    {
        public MainDbContext(DbContextOptions options)
            : base(options)
        {
        }
        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder
        builder)
        {
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li class="numberedList">We inherit from <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code>, and we pass a <code class="inlineCode">DbContextOptions</code> to the <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> constructor. <code class="inlineCode">DbContextOptions</code> contains creation options, such as the database connection string, which depends on the target DB engine.</li>
<li class="numberedList">All the collections that have been mapped to database tables will be added as properties of <code class="inlineCode">MainDbContext</code>. The mapping configuration will be defined inside of the overridden <code class="inlineCode">OnModelCreating</code> method with the help of the <code class="inlineCode">ModelBuilder</code> object passed as a parameter.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The next step <a id="_idIndexMarker926"/>is the creation of all the classes that represent the tables. These are called entities. We need an entity class for each DB table we want to map. Let’s create a <code class="inlineCode">Models</code> folder in the project root for all of them. The next subsection explains how to define all the required entities.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-269">Defining DB entities</h2>
<p class="normal">DB design, like the whole application design, is organized in iterations (see <em class="italic">Chapter 1, Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture</em>). Let’s suppose that, in the first iteration, we need a prototype with two database tables: one for all the travel packages and another one for all the locations referenced by the packages. Each package covers just one location, while a single location may be covered by several packages, so the two tables are connected by a one-to-many relationship.</p>
<p class="normal">So, let’s start with the location database table. As we mentioned at the end of the previous section, we need an entity class to represent the rows of this table. Let’s call the entity class <code class="inlineCode">Destination</code>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">namespace WWTravelClubDB.Models
{
    public class Destination
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public required string Name { get; set; }
        public required string Country { get; set; }
        public string? Description { get; set; }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">In the code above, all the DB fields must be represented by read/write C# properties. Since both the <code class="inlineCode">Name</code> and <code class="inlineCode">Country</code> properties are obligatory but we are not going to define a constructor, we added the <code class="inlineCode">required</code> keyword to instruct the compiler to signal an error whenever an instance is created without initializing them.</p>
<p class="normal">Suppose that each destination is something like a town or a region that can be defined by just its name and the country it is in and that all the relevant information is contained in its <code class="inlineCode">Description</code>. In future iterations, we will probably add several more fields. <code class="inlineCode">Id</code> is an auto-generated key.</p>
<p class="normal">However, now, we<a id="_idIndexMarker927"/> need to add information about how all the fields are mapped to DB fields. In Entity Framework Core, all the primitive types are mapped automatically to DB types by the DB engine-specific provider that’s used (in our case, the SQL Server provider).</p>
<p class="normal">Our only preoccupations are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Length limits on the string</strong>: They can be taken into account by applying adequate <code class="inlineCode">MaxLength</code> and <code class="inlineCode">MinLength</code> attributes to each string property. All the attributes that are useful for the entity’s configuration are contained in the <code class="inlineCode">System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations</code> and <code class="inlineCode">System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema</code> namespaces. Therefore, it’s good practice to add both of them to all the entity definitions.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Specifying which fields are obligatory and which ones are optional</strong>: If the project is not using the new <strong class="keyWord">Nullable Reference Type</strong> feature, by default, all the reference types (such as all the strings) are assumed to be optional, while all the value types (numbers and GUIDs, for instance) are assumed to be obligatory. If we want a reference type to be obligatory, then we must decorate it with the <code class="inlineCode">Required</code> attribute. On the other hand, if we want a <code class="inlineCode">T</code> type property to be optional, and <code class="inlineCode">T</code> is a value type, or the Nullable Reference Type feature is on, then we must replace <code class="inlineCode">T</code> with <code class="inlineCode">T?</code>. As a default, .NET 8 projects have the new Nullable Reference Type feature set.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Specifying which property represents the primary key</strong>: The key may be specified by decorating a property with the <code class="inlineCode">Key</code> attribute. However, if no <code class="inlineCode">Key</code> attribute is found, a property named <code class="inlineCode">Id</code> (if there is one) is taken as the primary key. In our case, there is no need for the <code class="inlineCode">Key</code> attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Since each destination is on <em class="italic">one</em> side of a one-to-many relationship, it must contain a collection of the related package entities; otherwise, it will be difficult to refer to the related entities in the clauses of our LINQ queries. This collection will have a fundamental role in our LINQ queries and will be populated by Entity Framework Core. However, as we will see later in this chapter, it must be ignored in most of the database update operations. Therefore, the best option to avoid compiler warnings is to assign them the null-forgiving fake default value: <code class="inlineCode">null!</code>.</p>
<p class="normal">Putting everything together, the final version of the <code class="inlineCode">Destination</code> class is as follows:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;
namespace WWTravelClubDB.Models
{
    public class Destination
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        [MaxLength(128)]
        Public required string Name { get; set; }
        [MaxLength(128)]
        Public required string Country { get; set; }
        public string? Description { get; set; }
        public ICollection&lt;Package&gt; Packages { get; set; } = null!
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Since<a id="_idIndexMarker928"/> the <code class="inlineCode">Description</code> property has no length limits, it will be implemented with a SQL Server <code class="inlineCode">nvarchar(MAX)</code> field of indefinite length. We can write the code for the <code class="inlineCode">Package</code> class in a similar way:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;
namespace WWTravelClubDB.Models
{
    public class Package
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        [MaxLength(128)]
        Public required string Name { get; set; }
        [MaxLength(128)]
        public string? Description { get; set; }
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
        public int DurationInDays { get; set; }
        public DateTime? StartValidityDate { get; set; }
        public DateTime? EndValidityDate { get; set; }
        public Destination MyDestination { get; set; } = null!
        public int DestinationId { get; set; }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Each package has a duration in days, as well as optional start and stop dates in which the package offer is valid. <code class="inlineCode">MyDestination</code> connects packages with their destinations in the many-to-one relationship that they have with the <code class="inlineCode">Destination</code> entity, while <code class="inlineCode">DestinationId</code> is the external key of the same relation.</p>
<p class="normal">While it is <a id="_idIndexMarker929"/>not obligatory to specify the external key, it is good practice to do so since this is the only way to specify some properties of the relationship. For instance, in our case, since <code class="inlineCode">DestinationId</code> is an <code class="inlineCode">int</code> (not nullable type), it is obligatory. </p>
<p class="normal">Therefore, the relationship here is one-to-many and not (0, 1)-to-many. Defining <code class="inlineCode">DestinationId</code> as <code class="inlineCode">int?</code> instead of <code class="inlineCode">int</code> would turn the one-to-many relationship into a (0, 1)-to-many relationship. Moreover, as we will see later in this chapter, having an explicit representation of the foreign key simplifies the update operations a lot, and some queries.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next section, we will explain how to define the in-memory collection that represents the database tables.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-270">Defining the mapped collections</h2>
<p class="normal">Once we have<a id="_idIndexMarker930"/> defined all the entities that are object-oriented representations of the database rows, we need to define the in-memory collections that represent the database tables themselves. As we mentioned in the <em class="italic">Understanding ORM basics </em>section, all the database operations are mapped to the operations on these collections (the <em class="italic">Querying and updating data with Entity Framework Core</em> section of this chapter explains how). It is enough to add a <code class="inlineCode">DbSet&lt;T&gt;</code> collection property to our <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> for each entity, <code class="inlineCode">T</code>. Usually, the name of each of these properties is obtained by pluralizing the entity name. Thus, we need to add the following two properties to our <code class="inlineCode">MainDbContext</code>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">public DbSet&lt;Package&gt; Packages { get; set; }
public DbSet&lt;Destination&gt; Destinations { get; set; }
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Up until now, we’ve translated database stuff into properties, classes, and data annotations. However, Entity Framework needs further information to interact with a database. The next subsection explains how to provide it.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-271">Completing the mapping configuration</h2>
<p class="normal">The mapping configuration<a id="_idIndexMarker931"/> information that we couldn’t specify in the entity definitions must be added with configuration code based on a fluent interface. The simplest way to add this configuration information is to add it using the <code class="inlineCode">OnModelCreating DbContext</code> method. Each piece of configuration information relative to an entity, <code class="inlineCode">T</code>, starts with <code class="inlineCode">builder.Entity&lt;T&gt;()</code> and continues with a call to a method that specifies that kind of constraint. Further nested calls specify further properties of the constraint. For instance, our one-to-many relationship may be configured as follows:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">builder.Entity&lt;Destination&gt;()
    .HasMany(m =&gt; m.Packages)
    .WithOne(m =&gt; m.MyDestination)
    .HasForeignKey(m =&gt; m.DestinationId)
    .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">The two sides <a id="_idIndexMarker932"/>of the relationship are specified through the navigation properties that we added to our entities. <code class="inlineCode">HasForeignKey</code> specifies the external key. Finally, <code class="inlineCode">OnDelete</code> specifies what to do with packages when a destination is deleted. In our case, it performs a cascade delete of all the packages related to that destination.</p>
<p class="normal">The same configuration can be defined by starting from the other side of the relationship, that is, starting with <code class="inlineCode">builder.Entity&lt;Package&gt;()</code>. Clearly, the developer must choose just one of the options:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">builder.Entity&lt;Package&gt;()
    .HasOne(m =&gt; m.MyDestination)
    .WithMany(m =&gt; m.Packages)
    .HasForeignKey(m =&gt; m.DestinationId)
    .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">The only difference is that the previous statement’s <code class="inlineCode">HasMany-WithOne</code> methods are replaced by the <code class="inlineCode">HasOne-WithMany</code> methods since we started from the other side of the relationship. Here, we can also choose the precision with which each decimal property is represented in its mapped database field. As a default, decimals are represented by 18 digits and 2 decimals. You can change this setting for each property with something like:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">...
.Property(m =&gt; m.Price)
        .HasPrecision(10, 3);
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">The <code class="inlineCode">ModelBuilder builder</code> object allows us to specify database indexes with something such as the following:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">builder.Entity&lt;T&gt;()
   .HasIndex(m =&gt; m.PropertyName);
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Multi-property indexes are defined as follows:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">builder.Entity&lt;T&gt;()
    .HasIndex("propertyName1", "propertyName2", ...);
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Starting from <a id="_idIndexMarker933"/>version 5, indexes can also be defined with attributes applied to the class. The following is the case of a single property index:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">[Index(nameof(Property), IsUnique = true)]
public class MyClass
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    [MaxLength(128)]
    public string Property { get; set; }
}
   
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">The following is the case of a multi-property index:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">[Index(nameof(Property1), nameof(Property2), IsUnique = false)]
public class MyComplexIndexClass
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

<p class="normal">Each of<a id="_idIndexMarker934"/> these classes must implement the <code class="inlineCode">IEntityTypeConfiguration&lt;&gt;</code> interface, whose unique method is <code class="inlineCode">Configure</code>.

<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">[EntityTypeConfiguration(typeof(DestinationConfiguration))]
public class Destination
{
  ...

<p class="normal">The configuration class can also be recalled from within the <code class="inlineCode">OnModelCreating</code> method of the context class:</p>

<p class="normal">If we add all the necessary configuration information, then our <code class="inlineCode">OnModelCreating</code> method will look as follows:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)

<p class="normal">I prefer to <a id="_idIndexMarker935"/>define just general configuration and relationships in the context class. It is also convenient to use data annotation just for restricting property values (maximum and minimum length, required fields, and so on). This way, entities don’t depend on the specific ORM used and can be exported outside of the data layer, if needed.</p>
<p class="normal">The best place for other entity-specific configurations is the configuration class. I also avoid using the <code class="inlineCode">EntityTypeConfiguration</code> attribute and call entity configuration classes from within the context class since this attribute ties the entity to a specific ORM.</p>
<p class="normal">The previous example shows a one-to-many relationship, but Entity Framework Core 8 also supports many-to-many relationship:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">modelBuilder
  .Entity&lt;Teacher&gt;()
  .HasMany(e =&gt; e.Classrooms)
  .WithMany(e =&gt; e.Teachers)
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">In the <a id="_idIndexMarker936"/>preceding case, the join entity and the database join table are created automatically, but you can also specify an existing entity as the join entity. In the previous example, the join entity might be the course that the teacher teaches in each classroom:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">modelBuilder
  .Entity&lt;Teacher&gt;()
  .HasMany(e =&gt; e.Classrooms)
  .WithMany(e =&gt; e.Teachers)
      .UsingEntity&lt;Course&gt;(
           b =&gt; b.HasOne(e =&gt; e.Teacher).WithMany()

           b =&gt; b.HasOne(e =&gt; e.Classroom).WithMany()
           .HasForeignKey(e =&gt; e.ClassroomId));
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Once you’ve configured Entity Framework Core, we can use all the configuration information we have to create the actual database and put all the tools we need in place in order to update the database’s structure as the application evolves. The next section explains how.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-272">Entity Framework Core migrations</h1>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve configured <a id="_idIndexMarker937"/>Entity Framework and defined our application-specific <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> subclass, we can use the Entity Framework Core design tools to generate the physical database and create the database structure snapshot that’s needed by Entity Framework Core to interact with the database.</p>
<p class="normal">Entity Framework Core design tools must be installed in each project that needs them as NuGet packages. There are two equivalent options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tools that work in any operating system console</strong>: These are available through the <code class="inlineCode">Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design</code> NuGet package. All Entity Framework Core commands are in <code class="inlineCode">dotnet ef .....</code> format since they are contained in the <code class="inlineCode">ef</code> command line’s .NET Core application.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tools that are specific to the Visual Studio Package Manager Console</strong>: These are contained in the <code class="inlineCode">Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools</code> NuGet package. They don’t need the <code class="inlineCode">dotnet ef</code> prefix since they can only be launched from<a id="_idIndexMarker938"/> the <strong class="keyWord">Package Manager Console</strong> inside Visual Studio.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Entity Framework Core’s <a id="_idIndexMarker939"/>design tools are used within the design/update procedure. This procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li class="numberedList" value="1">We modify <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> and the entities’ definitions as needed.</li>
<li class="numberedList">We launch the design tools to ask Entity Framework Core to detect and process all the changes we made.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once launched, the design tools update the database structure snapshot and generate a new <em class="italic">migration</em>, that is, a file containing all the instructions we need in order to modify the physical database to reflect all the changes we made.</li>
<li class="numberedList">We launch another tool to update the database with the newly created migration.</li>
<li class="numberedList">We test the newly configured DB layer, and if new changes are necessary, we go back to <em class="italic">step 1</em>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">When the data layer is ready, it is deployed in staging or production, where all the migrations are applied once more to the actual staging/production database.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">This is repeated several times in the various software project iterations and during the lifetime of the application.</p>
<p class="normal">If we operate on an already existing database, we need to configure <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> and its models to reflect the existing structure of all the tables we want to map. This can be done automatically with the <code class="inlineCode">Scaffold-DbContext</code> command (see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/scaffolding/?tabs=vs">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/scaffolding/?tabs=vs</a> for more details).</p>
<p class="normal">All classes generated by .NET are partial classes, so the user can enrich them with further methods without modifying the scaffolded classes by adding the new methods to partial classes with the same names.</p>
<p class="normal">Then, if we want to start using migration instead of continuing with direct database changes, we can call the design tools with the <code class="inlineCode">IgnoreChanges</code> option so that they generate an empty migration. Also, this empty migration must be passed to the physical database so that it can synchronize a database structure version associated with the physical database with the version that’s been recorded in the database snapshot. This version is important because it determines which migrations must be applied to a database and which ones have already been applied.</p>
<p class="normal">However, developers may also choose to continue manually modifying the database and repeating the scaffold operation after each change.</p>
<p class="normal">The whole design process needs a test/design database, and if we operate on an existing database, the structure of this test/design database must reflect the actual database – at least in terms of the tables we want to map. To enable design tools so that we can interact <a id="_idIndexMarker940"/>with the database, we must define the <code class="inlineCode">DbContextOptions</code> options that they pass to the <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> constructor. These options are important at design time since they contain the connection string of the test/design database. The design tools can be informed about our <code class="inlineCode">DbContextOptions</code> options if we create a class that implements the <code class="inlineCode">IDesignTimeDbContextFactory&lt;T&gt;</code> interface, where <code class="inlineCode">T</code> is our <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> subclass:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design;
namespace WWTravelClubDB
{
    public class LibraryDesignTimeDbContextFactory
        : IDesignTimeDbContextFactory&lt;MainDbContext&gt;
    {
        private const string connectionString =
            @"Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=wwtravelclub;
                Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true";
        public MainDbContext CreateDbContext(params string[] args)
        {
            var builder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder&lt;MainDbContext&gt;();
           
            builder.UseSqlServer(connectionString);
            return new MainDbContext(builder.Options);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal"><code class="inlineCode">connectionString</code> will be used by Entity Framework to create a new database in the local SQL Server instance that’s been installed in the development machine and connects with Windows credentials. You are free to change it to reflect your needs.</p>
<p class="normal">Now, we are ready to create our first migration! Let’s get started:</p>
<ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Let’s go to the <strong class="screenText">Package Manager Console</strong> and ensure that <strong class="screenText">WWTravelClubDB</strong> is selected as our default project.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Now, type <code class="inlineCode">Add-Migration initial</code> and press <em class="italic">Enter</em> to issue this command. Verify <a id="_idIndexMarker941"/>that you added the <code class="inlineCode">Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools</code> NuGet package before issuing this command; otherwise, you might get an “unrecognized command” error:

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.1: Adding the first migration</p>
<p class="normal"><code class="inlineCode">initial</code> is the name we gave our first migration. So, in general, the command is <code class="inlineCode">Add-Migration &lt;migration name&gt;</code>. When we operate on an existing database, we must add the <code class="inlineCode">-IgnoreChanges</code> option to the first migration (and just to that) so that an empty migration is created. References to the whole set of commands can be found in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li class="numberedList" value="3">If, after having created the migration but before having applied the migration to the database, we realize we made some errors, we can undo our action with the <code class="inlineCode">Remove-Migration</code> command. If the migration has already been applied to the database, the simplest way to correct our error is to make all the necessary changes to the code and then apply another migration.</li>
<li class="numberedList">As soon as the <code class="inlineCode">Add-Migration</code> command is executed, a new folder appears in our project:</li>

<p class="normal"><code class="inlineCode">20210924143018_initial.cs</code> is our migration expressed in an easy-to-understand language.</p>
<p class="normal">You may review the code to verify that everything is okay. You may also modify the migration content (only if you are enough of an expert to do it reliably) or simply undo the migration with the <code class="inlineCode">in</code> <code class="inlineCode">Remove-Migration Remove-Migration</code> command, which is the advised way to proceed when we discover errors.</p>
<p class="normal">Each <a id="_idIndexMarker942"/>migration contains an <code class="inlineCode">Up</code> method and a <code class="inlineCode">Down</code> method.</p>
<p class="normal">The <code class="inlineCode">Up</code> method implies the migration, while the <code class="inlineCode">Down</code> method undoes its changes. Accordingly, the <code class="inlineCode">Down</code> method contains the reverse actions of all the actions included in the <code class="inlineCode">Up</code> method in reverse order.</p>
<p class="normal"><code class="inlineCode">20210924143018_initial.Designer.cs</code> is the Visual Studio designer code, which you must not modify, while <code class="inlineCode">MainDbContextModelSnapshot.cs</code> is the overall database structure snapshot. If you add further migrations, new migration files and their designer counterparts will appear, and the unique <code class="inlineCode">MainDbContextModelSnapshot.cs</code> database structure snapshot will be updated to reflect the database’s overall structure.</p>
<p class="normal">The same command can be issued in an operating system console by typing <code class="inlineCode">dotnet ef migrations add initial</code>. This command must be issued from within the project’s root folder (not from within the solution’s root folder).</p>
<p class="normal">However, if <code class="inlineCode">Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design</code> is installed globally with <code class="inlineCode">dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef</code>, then we can use it in a project after adding it to that project by typing <code class="inlineCode">dotnet add package –-project &lt;project path&gt; Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design</code>. In this case, commands can be issued from any folder by specifying the <code class="inlineCode">--project &lt;project path&gt;</code> option.</p>
<p class="normal">Migrations can be applied to the database by typing <code class="inlineCode">Update-Database</code> in the Package Manager Console. The equivalent console command is <code class="inlineCode">dotnet ef database update</code>. Let’s try using this command to create the physical database!</p>
<p class="normal">The next subsection <a id="_idIndexMarker943"/>explains how to create database stuff that Entity Framework is unable to create automatically. After that, in the next section, we will use Entity Framework’s configuration and the database we generated with <code class="inlineCode">dotnet ef database update</code> to create, query, and update data.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-273">Understanding stored procedures and direct SQL commands</h2>
<p class="normal">Some database<a id="_idIndexMarker944"/> structures, like, for instance, stored procedures, can’t be generated automatically by the Entity Framework Core commands and declarations we described previously. Stored procedures such as generic SQL strings can be included manually in the <code class="inlineCode">Up</code> and <code class="inlineCode">Down</code> methods through the <code class="inlineCode">migrationBuilder.Sql("&lt;sql command&gt;")</code> method.</p>
<p class="normal">The safest way to do this <a id="_idIndexMarker945"/>is by adding a migration without performing any configuration changes so that the migration is empty when it’s created. Then, we can add the necessary SQL commands to the empty <code class="inlineCode">Up</code> method of this migration and their converse commands in the empty <code class="inlineCode">Down</code> method. It is good practice to put all the SQL strings in the properties of resource files (<code class="inlineCode">.resx</code> files).</p>
<p class="normal">Stored procedures should replace <code class="inlineCode">Entity</code> <code class="inlineCode">Framework</code> commands in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">When we need to perform manual SQL optimizations to increase the performance of some operations.</li>
<li class="bulletList">When <code class="inlineCode">Entity</code> <code class="inlineCode">Framework</code> doesn’t support the SQL operation, we need to perform. A typical example is the increment or decrement of a numeric field that occurs in all booking operations (air travel, hotels, and so on). Actually, we might replace the increment/decrement operation with a database read, an in-memory increment/decrement, and finally, a database update, all enclosed in the same transaction scope. However, this might be overkill for performance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Before starting to interact with our database, we can perform a further optional step: model optimizations.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-274">Compiled models</h1>
<p class="normal">Starting <a id="_idIndexMarker946"/>from version 6, Entity Framework Core introduced the possibility to create precompiled data structures that improve Entity Framework Core’s performance by about 10 times in the case of models with hundreds of entities (see the reference in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section for more details). This step is accomplished by generating some code that, once compiled together with the data layer project, creates data structures that our context classes can use to improve performance.</p>
<p class="normal">The usage of pre-compilation is advised just after you verify the system experiences slow-downs and also on very simple queries. In other words, it is better to start without pre-compilation and then possibly add it in case of slow-downs caused by the EF infrastructure.</p>
<p class="normal">Code is generated with the <code class="inlineCode">Optimize-DbContext</code> command provided by the <code class="inlineCode">Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tool</code> NuGet package that we already installed. The command accepts the folder name to place the code and the namespace to place all classes. In our case, let’s choose the <code class="inlineCode">Optimization</code> folder and the <code class="inlineCode">WWTravelClubDB.Optimization</code> namespace:</p>
<pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">Optimize-DbContext -Context MainDBContext -OutputDir Optimization -Namespace WWTravelClubDB.Optimization
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Here, the <code class="inlineCode">–Context</code> parameter must be passed the name of our context class. The <code class="inlineCode">Optimization</code><strong class="keyWord"> </strong>folder is automatically created and filled with classes.</p>
<p class="normal">The optimization code depends on the ORM configuration, so the <code class="inlineCode">Optimize-DbContext</code> command must be repeated each time a new migration is created.</p>
<p class="normal">Optimizations are enabled by passing the root of our optimization model as an option when an instance of the context class is created. Let’s open the <code class="inlineCode">LibraryDesignTimeDbContextFactory.cs</code> file and add the line below:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">builder.UseSqlServer(connectionString);
//Line to add. Add it after that the optimization model has been created
builder.UseModel(Optimization.MainDbContextModel.Instance);
return new MainDbContext(builder.Options);
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Now, you are ready to interact with the database through Entity Framework Core.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-275">Querying and updating data with Entity Framework Core</h1>
<p class="normal">To test our DB layer, we<a id="_idIndexMarker947"/> need to add a console project <a id="_idIndexMarker948"/>based on the same .NET Core version as our library to the solution. Let’s get started:</p>
<ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Let’s call the new console project <code class="inlineCode">WWTravelClubDBTest</code>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Now, we need to add our data layer as a dependency of the console project by right-clicking on the <strong class="screenText">Dependencies</strong> node of the console project and selecting <strong class="screenText">Add Project Reference</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Remove the content of the <code class="inlineCode">Program.cs</code> file and start by writing the following:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Console.WriteLine("program start: populate database, press a key to continue");
Console.ReadKey();
</code></pre>
</li>
<li class="numberedList">Then, add the following namespaces at the top of the file:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using WWTravelClubDB;
using WWTravelClubDB.Models;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using WWTravelClubDBTest;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Now that we have finished preparing our test project, we can experiment with queries and data updates. Let’s start by creating some database objects, that is, some destinations and packages. Follow these steps to do so:</p>
<ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li class="numberedList" value="1">First, we must create an instance of our <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> subclass with an appropriate connection string. We can use the same <code class="inlineCode">LibraryDesignTimeDbContextFactory</code> class that’s used by the design tools to get it:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">var context = new LibraryDesignTimeDbContextFactory()
.CreateDbContext();
</code></pre>
</li>
<li class="numberedList">New rows can be created by simply adding class instances to the mapped collections of our <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> subclass. If a <code class="inlineCode">Destination</code> instance has packages associated with it, we can simply add them to its <code class="inlineCode">Packages</code> property:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">var firstDestination= new Destination
{
    Name = "Florence",
    Country = "Italy",
    Packages = new List&lt;Package&gt;()
    {
        new Package
        {
            Name = "Summer in Florence",
            StartValidityDate = new DateTime(2019, 6, 1),
            EndValidityDate = new DateTime(2019, 10, 1),
            DurationInDays=7,
            Price=1000
        },
        new Package
        {
            Name = "Winter in Florence",
            StartValidityDate = new DateTime(2019, 12, 1),
            EndValidityDate = new DateTime(2020, 2, 1),
            DurationInDays=7,
            Price=500
        }
    }
};
context.Destinations.Add(firstDestination);
await context.SaveChangesAsync();
Console.WriteLine(
 $"DB populated: first destination id is {firstDestination.Id}");
Console.ReadKey();
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">There is no <a id="_idIndexMarker949"/>need to specify primary keys since they are auto-generated and will be filled in by the database. In fact, after the <code class="inlineCode">SaveChangesAsync()</code> operation synchronizes our context with the actual DB, the <code class="inlineCode">firstDestination.Id</code> property has a non-zero value. The same is true for the primary keys of <code class="inlineCode">Package</code>. Key auto-generation is the default behavior for all integer types.</p>
<p class="normal">When we declare<a id="_idIndexMarker950"/> that an entity (in our case, <code class="inlineCode">Package</code>) is a child of another entity (in our case, <code class="inlineCode">Destination</code>) by inserting it in a parent entity collection (in our case, the <code class="inlineCode">Packages</code> collection), there is no need to explicitly set its external key (in our case, <code class="inlineCode">DestinationId</code>) since it is inferred automatically by Entity Framework Core. Once created and synchronized with the <code class="inlineCode">firstDestination</code> database, we can add further packages in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Create a <code class="inlineCode">Package</code> class instance, set its <code class="inlineCode">DestinationId</code> external key to <code class="inlineCode">firstDestination.Id</code>, and add it to <code class="inlineCode">context.Packages</code></li>
<li class="bulletList">Create a <code class="inlineCode">Package</code> class instance, with no need to set its external key, and then add it to the <code class="inlineCode">Packages</code> collection of its parent <code class="inlineCode">Destination</code> instance</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The latter approach should be preferred when the two entities do not belong to the same aggregate since, in this case, the whole aggregate must be loaded in memory before operating on it to be sure all business rules are correctly applied and to prevent incoherences caused by simultaneous operations on different parts of the same aggregates (see the <em class="italic">Aggregates</em> subsection of <em class="italic">Chapter 7, Understanding the Different Domains in Software Solutions</em>).</p>
<p class="normal">Moreover, the<a id="_idIndexMarker951"/> latter option is the only possibility when a child entity (<code class="inlineCode">Package</code>) is added with its parent entity (<code class="inlineCode">Destination</code>) and the parent entity has an auto-generated principal key since, in this case, the external key isn’t available at the time we perform the additions.</p>
<p class="normal">In most of<a id="_idIndexMarker952"/> the other circumstances, the former option is simpler since the second option requires the parent <code class="inlineCode">Destination</code> entity to be loaded in memory, along with its <code class="inlineCode">Packages</code> collection, that is, together with all the packages associated with the <code class="inlineCode">Destination</code> object (by default, connected entities aren’t loaded by queries).</p>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s say we want to modify the <code class="inlineCode">Florence</code> destination and give a 10% increment to all <code class="inlineCode">Florence</code> package prices. How do we proceed? Follow these steps to find out how:</p>
<ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li class="numberedList" value="1">First, comment out all previous instructions for populating the database while keeping the <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> creation instruction:

Console.ReadKey();
var context = new LibraryDesignTimeDbContextFactory()

<p class="normal">So far, we’ve performed queries whose unique purpose is to update the retrieved entities. Next, we will explain how to retrieve information that will be shown to the user and/or used by complex business operations.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-276">Returning data to the presentation layer</h2>
<p class="normal">To keep the<a id="_idIndexMarker957"/> layers separated and to adapt queries to the data that’s actually needed by each <em class="italic">use case</em>, DB entities aren’t sent as they are to the presentation layer. Instead, the data is projected into smaller classes that contain the information that’s needed by the <em class="italic">use case</em>. These are implemented by the presentation layer’s <code class="inlineCode">caller</code> method. Objects that move data from one layer to another are <a id="_idIndexMarker958"/>called <strong class="keyWord">Data Transfer Objects</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">DTOs</strong>).</p>
<p class="normal">As an <a id="_idIndexMarker959"/>example, let’s create a DTO containing the summary information that is worth showing when returning a list of packages to the user (we suppose that, if needed, the user can get more details by clicking the package they are interested in):</p>
<ol class="numberedList" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Let’s add a DTO to our <code class="inlineCode">WWTravelClubDBTest</code> project that contains all the information that needs to be shown in a list of packages:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">namespace WWTravelClubDBTest
{
    public record PackagesListDTO
   {
        public int Id { get; init; }
        public required string Name { get; init; }
        public decimal Price { get; init; }
        public int DurationInDays { get; init; }
        public DateTime? StartValidityDate { get; init; }
        public DateTime? EndValidityDate { get; init; }
        public required string DestinationName { get; init; }
        public int DestinationId { get; init; }
        public override string ToString()
        {
         return string.Format("{0}. {1} days in {2}, price: {3}",
                Name, DurationInDays, DestinationName, Price);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li class="numberedList">We don’t need to load entities in memory and then copy their data into the DTO, but database data can be projected directly into the DTO, thanks to the LINQ<code class="inlineCode"> Select</code> clause. This minimizes how much data is exchanged with the database.</li>
<li class="numberedList">As an example, we can populate our DTOs with a query that checks all the packages that are available around August 10:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">var period = new DateTime(2019, 8, 10);
var list = await context.Packages
    .Where(m =&gt; period &gt;= m.StartValidityDate
    &amp;&amp; period &lt;= m.EndValidityDate)
    .Select(m =&gt; new PackagesListDTO
    {
        StartValidityDate=m.StartValidityDate,
        EndValidityDate=m.EndValidityDate,
        Name=m.Name,
        DurationInDays=m.DurationInDays,
        Id=m.Id,
        Price=m.Price,
        DestinationName=m.MyDestination.Name,
        DestinationId = m.DestinationId

</li>
<li class="numberedList">In<a id="_idIndexMarker960"/> the <code class="inlineCode">Select</code> clause, we can also navigate to any related entities to get the data we need. For instance, the preceding query navigates to the related <code class="inlineCode">Destination</code> entity to get the <code class="inlineCode">Package</code> destination name.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The programs stop at each <code class="inlineCode">Console.ReadKey()</code> method, waiting for you to hit any key. This way, you have time to analyze the output that’s produced by all the code snippets that we added to the <code class="inlineCode">Main</code> method.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Now, right-click on the <code class="inlineCode">WWTravelClubDBTest</code> project in Solution Explorer and set it as the start project. Then, run the solution.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Now, we will learn how to handle operations that can’t be efficaciously mapped to the immediate operations in the in-memory collections that represent the database tables.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-277">Issuing direct SQL commands</h2>
<p class="normal">Not all <a id="_idIndexMarker961"/>database operations can be executed efficiently by querying the database with LINQ and updating in-memory entities. For instance, counter increments can be performed more efficiently with a single SQL instruction. Moreover, some operations can be executed with acceptable performance if we define adequate stored procedures/SQL commands. In these cases, we are forced to either issue direct SQL commands to the database or call database-stored procedures from our Entity Framework code. There are two possibilities: SQL statements that perform database operations but do not return entities, and SQL statements that do return entities.</p>
<p class="normal">SQL commands that don’t return entities can be executed with the <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> method as follows:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Task&lt;int&gt; DbContext.Database.ExecuteSqlRawAsync(string sql, params object[] parameters)
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Parameters <a id="_idIndexMarker962"/>can be referenced in the string as <code class="inlineCode">{0}, {1}, ..., {n}</code>. Each <code class="inlineCode">{m}</code> is filled with the object contained at the <code class="inlineCode">m</code> index of the <code class="inlineCode">parameters</code> array, which is converted from a .NET type into the corresponding SQL type. The method returns the number of affected rows.</p>
<p class="normal">SQL commands that return collections of entities must be issued through the <code class="inlineCode">FromSqlRaw</code> method of the mapped collection associated with those entities:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">context.&lt;mapped collection&gt;.FromSqlRaw(string sql, params object[] parameters)
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Thus, for instance, a command that returns <code class="inlineCode">Package</code> instances would look something like this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">var results = await context.Packages.FromSqlRaw("&lt;some sql&gt;", par1, par2, ...).ToListAsync();
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">SQL strings and parameters work like this in the <code class="inlineCode">ExecuteSqlRaw</code> method. The following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">var allPackages = await context.Packages.FromSqlRaw(
    "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = {0}",
    myPackageName).ToListAsync();
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">We can also use string interpolation:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">var allPackages = await context.Packages.FromSqlRaw(
  $"SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Name = {myPackageName}").ToListAsync();
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">In case the objects to be returned by the SQL query are not mapped objects represented by a collection added to the DB context, like <code class="inlineCode">context.Packages</code>, we can use a new method added in .NET 7:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">IQueryable&lt;TResult&gt; DbContext.Database.SqlQueryRaw&lt;TResult&gt; (string sql, params object[] parameters)
</code></pre>
<p class="normal"><code class="inlineCode">SqlQueryRaw</code> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker963"/> method of the <code class="inlineCode">Database</code> property of the <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> object, and it accepts the class of the objects to return as a generic parameter (<code class="inlineCode">TResult</code>). However, in this case, Entity Framework Core is able to transform the SQL tuples returned by the database into objects only if the column names in the tuples are equal to the property names in <code class="inlineCode">TResult</code>. Name mismatches in some properties can be overcome by decorating these properties with the names of the columns they must be mapped from with the <code class="inlineCode">[Column("&lt;column name")]</code> attribute. This is also possible using fluent API configuration: <code class="inlineCode">.HasColumnName(&lt;column name")</code>.</p>
<p class="normal">It is good practice to put all the SQL strings in resource files and encapsulate all the <code class="inlineCode">ExecuteSqlRawAsync</code> and <code class="inlineCode">FromSqlRaw</code> calls inside the public methods that you defined in your <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> subclasses, in order to keep the dependence from a specific database inside of your Entity Framework Core-based data layer.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-278">Handling transactions</h2>
<p class="normal">All the <a id="_idIndexMarker964"/>changes that are made to a <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> instance are passed in a single transaction at the first <code class="inlineCode">SaveChangesAsync</code> call. However, sometimes, it is necessary to include queries and updates in the same transaction. In these cases, we must handle the transaction explicitly. Several Entity Framework Core commands can be included in a transaction if we put them inside a <code class="inlineCode">using</code> block associated with a transaction object:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using (var dbContextTransaction = context.Database.BeginTransaction())
try{
   ...
   ...
   dbContextTransaction.Commit();
 }
 catch
 {
   dbContextTransaction.Rollback();
 }
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">In the preceding code, <code class="inlineCode">context</code> is an instance of our <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> subclass. Inside the <code class="inlineCode">using</code> block, the transaction can be aborted and committed by calling its <code class="inlineCode">Rollback</code> and <code class="inlineCode">Commit</code> methods. Any <code class="inlineCode">SaveChanges</code> calls that are included in the transaction block use the transaction they are already in, instead of creating new ones.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-279">Deploying your data layer</h1>
<p class="normal">When<a id="_idIndexMarker965"/> your database layer is deployed in production or in staging, usually, an empty database already exists, so you must apply all the migrations in order to create all the database objects. This can be done by calling <code class="inlineCode">context.Database.Migrate()</code>. The <code class="inlineCode">Migrate</code> method applies the migrations that haven’t been applied to the databases yet, so it may be called safely several times during the application’s lifetime.</p>
<p class="normal"><code class="inlineCode">context</code> is an instance of our <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> class that must be passed through a connection string with enough privileges to create tables and perform all the operations included in our migrations. Thus, typically, this connection string is different from the string we will use during normal application operations.</p>
<p class="normal">During the deployment of a web application on Azure, we are given the opportunity to check migrations with a connection string we provide. We can also check migrations manually by calling the <code class="inlineCode">context.Database.Migrate()</code> method when the application starts. This will be discussed in detail in <em class="italic">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Implementing Frontend Microservices with ASP.NET Core</em>, which is dedicated to frontend applications based on ASP.NET Core MVC.</p>
<p class="normal">In some production environments, it is not possible to apply migrations during the application deployment because the person in charge of the deployment doesn’t have enough privileges to create a new database and/or to create and modify tables. In this case, we must transform migrations into SQL commands and pass them to the database administrator who, after having verified they will not damage the existing database and data, applies them.</p>
<p class="normal">We can transform all migrations in a given interval into SQL with the <code class="inlineCode">Script-Migration</code> command (see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/powershell">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/powershell</a>):</p>
<pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">Script-Migration -From &lt;initial migration&gt; -To &lt;final migration&gt; -Output &lt;name of output file&gt;
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">For desktop applications, we can apply migrations during the installation of the application and its subsequent updates.</p>
<p class="normal">At the first application installation and/or in subsequent application updates, we may need to populate some tables with initial data. For web applications, this operation can be performed at application startup, while for desktop applications, this operation can be included in the installation.</p>
<p class="normal">Database tables<a id="_idIndexMarker966"/> can be populated with Entity Framework Core commands. First, though, we need to verify whether the table is empty in order to avoid adding the same table rows several times. This can be done with the <code class="inlineCode">Any()</code> LINQ method, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">if(!context.Destinations.Any())
{
    //populate here the Destinations table
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Let’s take a look at a few advanced features that Entity Framework Core has to share.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-280">How data and domain layers communicate with other layers</h1>
<p class="normal">As discussed in <em class="italic">Chapter 7, Understanding the Different Domains in Software Solutions</em>, classical layer architectures use plain objects and repositories to communicate with the other layers.</p>
<p class="normal">Therefore, the <a id="_idIndexMarker967"/>entities that define Entity Framework Core configuration themselves can be used as they are to communicate with other layers, since they are just record-like lists of public properties, as prescribed for plain objects.</p>
<p class="normal">The case <a id="_idIndexMarker968"/>of domain layers and onion architectures is slightly more complex, since, in this case, the domain layer communicates with the application layer through rich objects whose methods represent application domain rules. Accordingly, in general, the remainder of the application can’t access all domain layer objects’ properties but is forced to modify them through their own methods, in order to enforce domain rules.</p>
<p class="normal">In other words, Entity Framework entities are record-like lists of public properties with almost no methods, while DDD entities should have methods that encode domain logic, more sophisticated validation logic, and read-only properties. While further validation logic and methods can be added without breaking Entity Framework’s operations, adding read-only properties that must not be mapped to database properties can create problems that must be handled adequately. Preventing properties from being mapped to the database is quite easy–all we need to do is decorate them with the <code class="inlineCode">NotMapped</code> attribute or, using the fluent API, as <code class="inlineCode">.Ignore(e =&gt; e.PropertyName).</code></p>
<p class="normal">The issues that <a id="_idIndexMarker969"/>read-only properties <a id="_idIndexMarker970"/>have are a little bit more complex and can be solved in three fundamental ways:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Map Entity Framework entities to different classes</strong>: Define the DDD entities as different classes and copy data to/from them when entities are returned/passed to repository methods. This is the easiest solution, but it requires that you write some code so that you can convert the entities between the two formats. DDD entities are defined in the domain layer, while the Entity Framework entities continue to be defined in the data layer. This is the cleaner solution, but it causes a non-trivial overhead in both code writing and maintenance. I recommend it when you have complex aggregates with several complex methods.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Map table fields to private properties</strong>: Let Entity Framework Core map fields to private class fields so that you can decide how to expose them to properties by writing custom getters and/or setters. It is sufficient to give either the <code class="inlineCode">_&lt;property name&gt;</code> name or the <code class="inlineCode">_&lt;property name in camel case&gt;</code> name to these private fields, and Entity Framework will use them instead of their associated properties. In this case, DDD entities defined in the domain layer are also used as data layer entities. The main disadvantage of this approach is that we can’t use data annotations to configure each property because DDD entities can’t depend on how the underlying data layer is implemented.
    <p class="normal">Therefore, we must configure all database mapping in the <code class="inlineCode">OnModelCreating</code> <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> method, or in configuration classes associated with each entity (see <em class="italic">Chapter 13</em>,<em class="italic"> Interacting with Data in C# – Entity Framework Core</em>). Both options look less readable than data annotations to me, so I don’t like this technique, but other professionals use it.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Hide Entity Framework entities behind interfaces</strong>: Hide each Entity Framework entity with all its public properties behind an interface that, when needed, only exposes property getters. Entities are defined as <code class="inlineCode">internal</code> so outer layers can access them just through the interfaces they implement. This way, we can force the usage of methods that implement business logic rules to modify entity properties. Also, <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> is defined as <code class="inlineCode">internal</code>, so it can be accessed through the <code class="inlineCode">IUnitOfWork</code> interface that it implements from the outer levels. Interfaces can be defined in a different library for better decoupling from the outer layers. In terms of the onion architecture, the library that defines all interfaces is the next layer in from the Entity Framework layer. As usual, interfaces are coupled with their implementations in the dependency injection engine. This is the solution I prefer when there are several simple entities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker971"/>suppose that we would like to define a DDD interface called <code class="inlineCode">IDestination</code> for the <code class="inlineCode">Destination</code> entity, and suppose we would like to expose the <code class="inlineCode">Id</code>, <code class="inlineCode">Name</code>, and <code class="inlineCode">Country</code> properties as read-only since, once a <a id="_idIndexMarker972"/>destination is created, it can’t be modified anymore. Here, it is sufficient to let <code class="inlineCode">Destination</code> implement <code class="inlineCode">IDestination</code> and to define <code class="inlineCode">Id</code>, <code class="inlineCode">Name</code>, <code class="inlineCode">Country</code>, and <code class="inlineCode">Description</code> as read-only in <code class="inlineCode">IDestination</code>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">public interface IDestination
{
    int Id { get; }
    string Name { get; }
    string Country { get; }
    string Description { get; set; }
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Another difference between DDD with onion architectures and a classical data layer is that, in classical data layers, all operations and queries on data are exposed as repository methods, while in domain layers, repository methods just encode creations, deletions, and queries, while modification operations are performed by methods of the rich domain layer classes.</p>
<p class="normal">A complete example of domain layer implementation is described in <em class="italic">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Implementing Frontend Microservices with ASP.NET Core</em>.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-281">Understanding Entity Framework Core advanced features</h1>
<p class="normal">An <a id="_idIndexMarker973"/>interesting Entity Framework advanced feature that is worth mentioning is global filters, which were introduced at the end of 2017. They enable techniques such as soft delete and multi-tenant tables that are shared by several users, where each user just <em class="italic">sees</em> its records.</p>
<p class="normal">Global filters are defined with the <code class="inlineCode">modelBuilder</code> object, which is available in the <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> <code class="inlineCode">OnModelCreating</code> method. The syntax for this method is as follows:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyEntity&gt;().HasQueryFilter(m =&gt; &lt;define filter condition here&gt;);
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">For instance, if we add an <code class="inlineCode">IsDeleted</code> property to our <code class="inlineCode">Package</code> class, we may soft delete a <code class="inlineCode">Package</code> without removing it from the database by defining the following filter:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Package&gt;().HasQueryFilter(m =&gt; !m.IsDeleted);
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">However, filters contain <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> properties. Thus, for instance, if we add a <code class="inlineCode">CurrentUserID</code> property to our <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> subclass (whose value is set as soon as a <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> instance is created), then we can add a filter like the following one to all the entities that refer to a user ID:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Document&gt;().HasQueryFilter(m =&gt; m.UserId == CurrentUserId);
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">With the preceding filter in place, the currently logged-in user can only access the documents they own (the ones that have their <code class="inlineCode">UserId</code>). Similar techniques are very useful in the implementation of multi-tenant applications.</p>
<p class="normal">Another interesting feature that is worth mentioning is mapping entities to un-updatable database queries, which was introduced in version 5.</p>
<p class="normal">When you define an entity, you can define explicitly either the name of the mapped database table or the name of a mapped updatable view:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code"> modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyEntity1&gt;().ToTable("MyTable");
 modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyEntity2&gt;().ToView("MyView");
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">When an entity is mapped to a view, no table is generated by database migration, so the database view must be defined manually by the developer.</p>
<p class="normal">If the view we would like to map our entity in is not updatable, LINQ cannot use it to pass updates to the database. In this case, we can map the same entity simultaneously to a view and a table:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyEntity&gt;().ToTable("MyTable").ToView("MyView");
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Entity Framework <a id="_idIndexMarker974"/>will use the view for the queries and the table for the updates. This is useful when we create a newer version of a database table but we want to also take data from the old version of the table in all queries. In this case, we may define a view that takes data from both the old and the new tables but passes all updates only on the new table.</p>
<p class="normal">The option to set property defaults is also interesting. This can be done by specifying an override for the <code class="inlineCode">ConfigureConventions</code> <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> method. For instance, we can set a default precision for all decimal properties:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">protected override void ConfigureConventions(
    ModelConfigurationBuilder configurationBuilder)
{
      configurationBuilder.Properties&lt;decimal&gt;()
          .HavePrecision(10, 3);
          ...
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Specifying a default maximum length for all string properties is also useful:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">protected override void ConfigureConventions(
    ModelConfigurationBuilder configurationBuilder)
{
      configurationBuilder.Properties&lt;decimal&gt;()
          .HavePrecision(10, 3);
      configurationBuilder.Properties&lt;string&gt;()
          .HaveMaxLength(128);
       ...
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Another interesting feature that was gradually introduced in the last versions of Entity Framework Core is the mapping of JSON database columns. In particular, JSON data contained in a single JSON column can be queried, and the JSON objects mapped to .NET types.</p>
<p class="normal">Suppose that an <code class="inlineCode">Author</code> class that must be mapped to a database table has a <code class="inlineCode">Contact</code> property containing a complex object, and suppose we would like to store this object in a database JSON column of the <code class="inlineCode">Author</code> table. We can do it with the help of the <code class="inlineCode">OwnsOne</code> configuration method, as follows:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Author&gt;().OwnsOne(
            author =&gt; author.Contact, ownedNavigationBuilder =&gt;
            {
                ownedNavigationBuilder.ToJson();
            });
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">After this <a id="_idIndexMarker975"/>configuration, the <code class="inlineCode">contact</code> object can be queried as a standard navigation property:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code"> context.Authors
  .Where(m =&gt; m.Contact.Email == searchEmail).FirstOrDefaultAsync();
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">We can recursively also map sub-objects contained in the <code class="inlineCode">contact</code> object, such as a collection of addresses, but in this case, we must use <code class="inlineCode">OwnsMany</code>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Author&gt;().OwnsOne(
            author =&gt; author.Contact, ownedNavigationBuilder =&gt;
            {
                ownedNavigationBuilder.ToJson();
		  ownedNavigationBuilder.OwnsMany(
			contactDetails =&gt; contactDetails.Addresses);
            });
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">After that, the nested Addresses JSON collection can also be queried with the usual LINQ syntax:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">context.Authors
  .Where(m =&gt; m.Contact.Addresses.Any()).FirstOrDefaultAsync();
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">The above query returns all authors with a nonempty addresses list.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-282">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we looked at the essentials of ORM basics and why they are so useful. Then, we described Entity Framework Core. In particular, we discussed how to configure database mappings with class annotations and other declarations and commands that are included in <code class="inlineCode">DbContext</code> subclasses, and in configuration classes associated with each entity.</p>
<p class="normal">Then, we discussed how to create data structures for improving ORM performance and how to automatically create and update the physical database with the help of migrations, as well as how to query and pass updates to the database through Entity Framework Core. Finally, we learned how to pass direct SQL commands and transactions through Entity Framework Core, as well as how to deploy a data layer based on Entity Framework Core.</p>
<p class="normal">This chapter also reviewed some advanced features that were introduced in the latest Entity Framework Core releases.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we move on to microservices orchestrators and will learn how to deploy and manage microservices on Kubernetes.</p>
