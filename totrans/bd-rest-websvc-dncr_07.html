                    <h1 class="header-title">Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Most projects are a team effort. The team could be located in different places or in the same place, and members from different locations have to work in sync mode so their changes won't conflict with other team members. A system won't mature until it is used in various scenarios; these scenarios could be based on the experience of domain experts or come from the production environment. There is a chance that a system could crash in the production environment even if the system is regarded as a perfect system. In terms of web applications, the conditions are more critical due to performance glitches, bad user experiences, and so on. A system should go through a process where, if a team member makes changes, the code is integrated after unit tests and the build is then deployed in the related environment.</p>
<p>When we say deployment, Xcopy deployment immediately comes into our minds. In this type of deployment, you simply build and copy the related files and deploy/paste to a relevant environment.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss the fundamentals of deployment and the influence of emerging practices, such as <strong>continuous integration</strong> (<strong>CI</strong>) and <strong>continuous deployment</strong> (<strong>CD</strong>).  We will focus on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Azure environment</li>
<li>Publishing/hosting</li>
<li>CI and CD using TFS online</li>
<li>The difference between CI and CD</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction – deployment terminology</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Before proceeding further, we should first discuss why we are talking about deployment. The deployment cycle is one that has a specific flow and we should understand the deployment terminology. Deployment terminology simply includes the steps that start with code changes up to release. In this section, we will discuss all these deployment steps.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The build stage</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the build stage, the service source gets compiled without any errors along with the passing of all corresponding unit tests. This stage produces build artifacts.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Continuous integration </h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>CI forces the entire application to be built again every time a developer commits any change—the application code gets compiled and a comprehensive set of automated tests is run against it. This practice emerged from the problems of the frequent integration of code in large teams. The basic idea is to keep the delta, or change to the software, small. This provides confidence that the software is in a workable state. Even if a check-in made by a developer breaks the system, it is easy to fix it using this process.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Deployment</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Hardware provisioning, installing the base OS and the correct version of the .NET framework are prerequisites for deployment. The next part of it is to advance these build artifacts into production through various stages. The combination of these two parts is referred to as the deployment stage. There is no distinction between the deployment and release stages in most of the applications.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Continuous deployment</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In CD, each successful build gets deployed to a preferred environment, for example, production. Environments vary from organization to organization. So, CD is not meant for a production environment but you can use it for other environments too like dev, staging, and so on. CD is more important from a technical team's perspective. Under CD, there are several other practices, such as automated unit testing, labeling, versioning of build numbers, and traceability of changes. With continuous delivery, the technical team ensures that the changes pushed to production through various lower environments work as expected in production. Usually, these are small and deployed very quickly.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Continuous delivery</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Continuous delivery is different from CD. CD comes from a technical team's perspective, whereas continuous delivery is more focused on providing the deployed code as early as possible to the customer. To make sure that customers get the right defect-free product, in continuous delivery, every build must pass through all the quality assurance checks. Once the product passes the satisfactory quality verification, it is the business stakeholders' decision when to release it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Build and deployment pipeline</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The build and deployment pipeline is part of implementing continuous delivery through automation. It is a workflow of steps through which the code is committed in the source repository. At the other end of the deployment pipeline, the artifacts for release are produced. Some of the steps that may make up the build and deployment pipeline are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit tests</li>
<li>Integration tests</li>
<li>Code coverage and static analysis</li>
<li>Regression tests</li>
<li>Deployments to staging environment</li>
<li>Load/stress tests</li>
<li>Deployment to release repository</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Release</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A business feature made available to the end user is referred to as the release of a feature. To release a feature or service, the relevant build artifacts should be deployed beforehand. Usually, the feature toggle manages the release of a feature. If the feature flag (also called the feature toggle) is not switched on in production, it is called a dark release of the specified feature.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Prerequisites for successful RESTful services deployments</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The success of any system deployment depends upon the architectural style and practices the team is following. Our RESTful services have more chances of being successful with the adoption of the following practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-sufficient teams</strong>: Amazon, which is a pioneer of SOA and microservice architectures, follows the Two Pizza Teams paradigm. This means usually a microservice team will have no more than 7 – 10 team members. These team members will have all the necessary skills and roles; for example, development, operations, and business analyst. Such a service team handles the development, operations, and management of a microservice.</li>
<li><strong>CI and CD</strong>: CI and CD are prerequisites for implementing RESTful services that are a part of a system based on a microservices architectural style. Smaller self-sufficient teams, that can integrate their work frequently, are precursors to the success of microservices. This architecture is not as simple as a monolith. However, automation and the ability to push code upgrades regularly enables teams to handle complexity. Tools, such as <strong>Team Foundation Online Services</strong> (<strong>TFS</strong>), TeamCity, and Jenkins, are quite popular toolchains in this space.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as code</strong>: The idea of representing hardware and infrastructure components, such as networks with code, is new. It helps you make deployment environments, such as integration, testing, and production, look exactly identical. This means developers and test engineers will be able to reproduce production defects easily in lower environments. With tools such as CFEngine, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and Powershell DSC, you can write your entire infrastructure as code. With this paradigm shift, you can also put your infrastructure under a version control system and ship it as an artifact in deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Utilization of cloud-computing</strong>: Cloud computing is a big catalyst for adopting microservices. It is not mandatory, as such, for microservice deployment though. Cloud computing comes with a near-infinite scale, elasticity, and rapid provisioning capability. It is a no-brainer that the cloud is a natural ally of microservices. So, knowledge and experience with the Azure cloud will help you adopt microservices.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Azure environment</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Azure is a Microsoft service that offers various cloud-computing services. Azure is a cloud platform that helps you to build, deploy, and manage applications globally.</p>
<p>Before we discuss the Azure environment, we should understand cloud-computing.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Cloud computing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In simple words, cloud-computing is a store/place that provides various computer-based services namely storage, databases, servers, and software, over the internet (here, the internet is termed as the cloud).</p>
<p>There are various terms in existence related to cloud-computing, you can refer to this link for these terms: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/cloud-computing-dictionary/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/cloud-computing-dictionary/</a>.</p>
<p>These services can be sold by anyone and the vendors/companies that provide these cloud-computing services are called cloud providers.</p>
<p>Cloud-computing is not a new term, it has been around for a while, it's just that now it has become popular.  If you are using any online services that help you to send or receive your emails to or from other persons, then this is cloud-computing. With the help of the cloud, you can do almost anything you want. These services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of new applications</li>
<li>Storing data</li>
<li>Hosting, deploying applications</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are many more activities, depending upon the services offered by your cloud provider or what kind of subscription you have.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The benefits of the cloud</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>These days, cloud-computing plays an important role in the growth of businesses related to IT resources. Nowadays, everyone is thinking differently from a legacy system; the cloud has benefits for all with its advantages, as discussed here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pick and start</strong>: If you have any type of subscription with cloud-computing you won’t need to think, just pick your service and start from anywhere. You just require an internet to start with.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: When you go with the cloud, there is no need to think about spending money on buying costly hardware or related infrastructure. You can get the kinds of hardware you require and these are cost-effective.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: You can commission new resources quickly; these services are very performant.</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: The most important benefit of cloud-computing is that you need not think about the availability of services as these are globally available. For example, if you commissioned a virtual machine from India then you need not worry about using this machine even though you may be in another part of the world.</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Cloud-computing service models</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There is a huge list of cloud-computing services, but the best types of cloud-computing services are defined as the following (other types are based on these service types only):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong>IaaS</strong>): This provides infrastructure, namely storage, virtual machines, and so on. For more info, go to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-iaas/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-iaas/</a>. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-iaas/"/></li>
<li><strong>Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong>PaaS</strong>): This provides an on-demand environment for activities such as development or testing, or managing applications. For more info, go to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-paas/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-paas/</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Software as a Service</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>): This provides software applications on demand. There might be various subscription models from the cloud-computing provider under which you can subscribe to specific software applications. For more information, go to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-saas/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-saas/</a>.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Discussing the Azure environment</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Azure environment provides a way of getting its various services using the internet. The following screenshot represents a typical overview of all cloud-computing service models:</p>

<li><strong>Pull Requests</strong>: This is a way to work in a collaborative manner. You can initiate a Pull Request anytime, click on Code and select New Pull Request, and the owner or maintainers of the project will be notified about this pull request.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Work</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>By default, it displays the Work Items screen, showing you the items assigned to you or the tasks/bugs you’re working on or have worked on. We have created a new project so you will get a blank page; to start with work items, you need to create a few backlog items and then assign them within the team.</p>
<p>Click on Backlog and then add a title for your Product backlog from the new template that appears on the screen. See the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/30f71f7f-c4fc-403e-a523-b2a6c4bb1233.png"/></div>
<p>New product backlog</p>
<p>You can see in the preceding screenshot that, by default, you are given six sprints. Now, open a newly created product backlog item and provide a complete description – details such as efforts for this work, who will work on this item, or who will be the owner of this work item. See the following screenshot, which shows everything:</p>
<div><img src="img/4f9b1533-aec2-49af-99dd-4afafbf88eac.png"/></div>
<p>Product backlog item</p>
<p>Now, go to Sprint 1 and set the dates – you should set the dates to start your current iteration as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/e1e7cd5c-4a85-42cc-a822-35a538822f63.png" style="width:29.83em;height:35.83em;"/></div>
<p>Similarly, you can add more product backlog items. Do not move items to Sprint 1. The board view of the Backlog items screen would look like the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/154fe8d0-6116-412c-b955-1f787c9fcc65.png"/></div>
<p>Board backlog items</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding code to the repository</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We did not add any code to our repository; now, it's time to do that. To add code, you can either click on Code and upload the files directly from the web interface or go to Source Control from your Visual Studio IDE and check in the code after adding the repository. In this section, we will add our code using Visual Studio. To do so follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Visual Studio</li>
<li>Create or open your existing project</li>
<li>Open Team Explorer</li>
<li>Click on Connect TFS server</li>
<li>Add a TFS server if you can't find a server, and then provide a valid address for it</li>
<li>Click Connect</li>
</ol>
<p>The following screenshot shows a connection with FlixOneProductServices:</p>

<p>Viewing Code</p>
<p>You have successfully hosted your project to VSTS. In the following sections, we will discuss build and deployment.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Test</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This screen of VSTS helps you to create various test plans so you can track manual testing for a sprint. It helps to monitor when manual testing is completed for the current sprint. We discussed various terms of testing in <a href="17c8ef83-d95b-41af-9b61-54f69981bc3a.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Testing RESTful Web Services</em>.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will see how this helps us to test our sprint by creating a test plan and test cases.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a test plan</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>From the Test Plans tab, click on + and then click on Test plan, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/cbc45c0a-054d-4596-b4ce-9e51d3226a44.png"/></div>
<p>Creating a test plan</p>
<p>In the next screen, name your Test plan, make sure you have selected a correct sprint for the test plan. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/88819268-face-4495-9d2b-6c727dab05e6.png" style="width:38.92em;height:23.17em;"/></div>
<p>Naming your test plan</p>
<p>As the test plan is for a manual test, we now have to add the backlog items that need to be tested. In your case, we are just adding Sprint 1 backlog items. In doing this, we have added test suites for all backlog items of Sprint 1.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating test cases</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the previous section, we have created the Iteration 1 Test plan and added a test suite to it. Now, we need to create a test case, click on New and select New test case:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937 image-border" src="img/2d94932c-e31a-4666-910e-050cfbed3575.png" style="width:113.00em;height:24.08em;"/></div>
<p>Creating a new test case</p>
<p>Complete your test case by adding a valid name, and the steps with expected output to the test case. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938 image-border" src="img/4295b961-0166-441e-bd0d-5edb6b6f7dee.png" style="width:101.50em;height:40.67em;"/></div>
<p>Writing a test case</p>
<p>You can now assign the testers to these test cases or test suites so that testers can run these tests.</p>

<p>In previous sections, we have created test cases that run manually. Click on the test suites and click on Run to run the available tests. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939 image-border" src="img/0f1c0743-22a2-4ea8-831c-aaa1a4600e4d.png" style="width:112.83em;height:25.33em;"/></div>
<p>Running manual tests</p>
<p>These tests will run in the browser window so please make sure your browser doesn't block popups, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941 image-border" src="img/586b376f-ca5a-447a-821e-6f70c0fc24a6.png" style="width:89.83em;height:22.42em;"/></div>
<p>Verifying manual test results</p>
<p>As these tests are manual, you need to test these manually. After execution of these tests, you have to verify the expected output and mark the test as a pass or fail, accordingly. The overall results of test cases will be shown in the test suite window.</p>
<p>In this section, you have created a test plan, a test suite for the current iteration, and manual test cases to test a specific iteration, code changes, a build, or release.</p>

<p>Wiki pages help team members to work together. These pages can consist of project documentation or instructions to work on a project such as coding guidelines, and so on. Initially, you will get a blank template by clicking the Create Wiki button, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942 image-border" src="img/cc5c8f02-6ea2-4551-a08b-0e6375b4d92e.png" style="width:113.58em;height:40.75em;"/></div>
<p>Creating Wiki</p>
<p>From the Create Wiki page template you can add as many pages as you want. Wiki pages support for markdown: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/collaborate/markdown-guidance?view=vsts">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/collaborate/markdown-guidance?view=vsts</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Build and Release tab</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Build and Release tab provides the facility to create a build and release for the project. In this section, we will discuss CI and CD using VSTS. Initially, there would not be any build definition.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">CI versus CD</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We have already discussed these two methods in previous sections. In this section, we will briefly discuss the difference between CI and CD.</p>
<p>CI is a practice where by all team members (developers) integrate their code. This happens on every check-in, whenever a developer pushes changes, or as the code is configured, CI triggers.  The most important advantage of this is that it saves time during your development cycle as it identifies conflicts, if there are any. This starts with the initial steps to set up automotive tests. As soon as someone pushes changes to the repository, it triggers the build and tests.</p>
<p>Continuous deployment solves the deployment problems of the code while deploying to the production environment.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">CI and CD using TFS online</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this section, we will discuss the continuous integration of our project. Go to the Builds tab and then Build Definitions and click on + New:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943 image-border" src="img/b864d14f-956a-47af-b828-9ae3f500c24f.png" style="width:112.58em;height:29.25em;"/></div>
<p>Creating a new definition</p>
<p>In the next step, the system will ask you to choose your repository. Select Repository Source Control and map the branches, then click on Continue:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944 image-border" src="img/98fee334-c51b-44ee-b86e-966e18fe91d0.png" style="width:110.42em;height:42.50em;"/></div>
<p>Selecting a repository source</p>
<p>From the next screen, choose your template; in our case, choose ASP.NET Core:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945 image-border" src="img/b5d9a2c0-c4e1-4e3c-a9b8-63c4e0a53b56.png" style="width:110.25em;height:45.25em;"/></div>
<p>Selecting ASP.NET Core template</p>
<p>Follow the template instructions and provide the required values, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946 image-border" src="img/51800ea5-a561-4996-903f-aa4ddda2b3d2.png" style="width:92.17em;height:49.67em;"/></div>
<p>Creating build tasks</p>
<p>The following are the basic but important concepts related to VSTS; these are also important to understand so that you can configure build steps successfully:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tasks</strong>: These are the build steps that instruct VSTS to perform specific tasks</li>
<li><strong>Variables</strong>: These are the build configuration values that tell the build agent about system or custom values</li>
<li><strong>Triggers</strong>: These enable various tasks based on whether you have enabled CI or not</li>
<li><strong>Options</strong>: These are the build properties, for which you can provide build description, build job time out, and so on</li>
<li><strong>Retention</strong>: Retention policies can be built as required; typical policies are how long you want to keep good or bad builds with you</li>
</ul>
<p>To make our example simple, I selected Changeset #5 to save the build definition:</p>
<div><img src="img/13c8ad40-af71-42f5-90fa-0112b6faca50.png" style="width:42.00em;height:38.92em;"/></div>
<p>Saving build definition and queue</p>
<p>Now, you can see the build results under the Build and Release tab – your build might not be run (please revisit all the steps); the following screenshot shows the verified steps:</p>
<div><img src="img/90c3add2-6ea0-45c5-80ba-ccc5041641a9.png" style="width:9.58em;height:12.00em;"/></div>
<p>Build steps</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Initiating the CD release process</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You have already set up the CI process and now it's time to go with CD. Go to the Release tab and click on the New definition button:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947 image-border" src="img/03ef9076-cfe3-4e4d-96d5-ea839fdc771f.png" style="width:58.58em;height:20.25em;"/></div>
<p>Adding release definition</p>
<p>Select a template as per your application. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/8c5ab7bd-6577-4e86-b2a6-4edf0d971451.png"/></div>
<p>Selecting Azure App Service Deployment</p>
<p>Add an artifact to the release definition by selecting your repository or build, refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948 image-border" src="img/02c28bd3-7ab1-403b-86b8-9f06880fe272.png" style="width:26.50em;height:27.08em;"/></div>
<p>Adding an artifact</p>
<p>Set values for your deployment environment, what Azure service, or app type you are going to use, and so on. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949 image-border" src="img/272a86d1-ccc5-4347-b6db-dcefc5fe6956.png" style="width:113.83em;height:42.33em;"/></div>
<p>Adding task values</p>
<p>Go to Release and you can see the status of your releases; we have added only one release definition so you will see something like the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950 image-border" src="img/f0cc4426-2425-46b0-9611-de37ef40666a.png" style="width:52.58em;height:29.92em;"/></div>
<p>Release deployment status</p>
<p>We have not deployed our release yet so its status is NOT DEPLOYED. You can manually trigger the deployment. This release is meant for a development environment – you can set as many environments as you want. In this section, we have seen how to initiate CI and CD using VSTS.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Deployment terminology makes a team become aligned with its work, even if teams are working in different geographical zones. With the help of CI, CD teams are in sync as they receive recent changes immediately after check-ins by any of the teams working on the project.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will cover a testing paradigm in the day-to-day activities of development. We will discuss important terms associated with the test paradigm, including the theory around these terms, and then we will discuss code examples with a knowledge of Stubs, Mocks, and understanding integration and security, and performance testing.</p>
