- en: ASP.NET Core is the most powerful web framework provided by Microsoft and is
    full of hidden features that make it even more powerful and useful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your application should not be made to match the framework; your framework should
    be able to do what your application really needs. With this book, you will learn
    how to find the hidden screws you can turn to get the most out of the framework.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developers working with ASP.NET Core will be able to put their knowledge to
    work with this practical guide to customizing ASP.NET Core. The book provides
    a hands-on approach to implementation and its associated methodologies that will
    have you up and running and productive in no time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is a compact collection of default ASP.NET Core behaviors you might
    want to change and step-by-step explanations of how to do so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of this book, you will know how to customize ASP.NET Core to get
    an optimized application out of it according to your individual needs.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To follow the next chapters, you should be familiar with the base architecture
    of ASP.NET Core and its components. This book tackles almost all of the components
    of the architecture.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The following figure shows the base architecture overview of ASP.NET Core 6.0\.
    Let''s quickly go through the components shown here from the bottom to the top
    layer:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/Image79467.jpg)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: At the bottom, there is the **Host** layer. This is the layer that bootstraps
    the web server and all the stuff that is needed to start up an ASP.NET Core application,
    including logging, configuration, and the service provider. This layer creates
    the actual request objects and their dependencies that are used in the layers
    above.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next layer above **Host** is the **Middleware** layer. This layer works
    with the request object or manipulates it. This attaches the middleware to the
    request object. It executes the middleware for things such as error handling,
    authenticating HSTS, CORS, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Above that, there is the **Routing** layer, which routes the request to the
    endpoints depending on the route patterns defined. Endpoint routing is the new
    player from ASP.NET Core 3.1 and separates routing from the UI layers above to
    enable routing for different endpoints, including Blazor, gRPC, and SignalR. As
    a reminder: in previous versions of ASP.NET Core, routing was part of the MVC
    layer, and every other UI layer needed to implement its own routing.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The actual endpoints are provided by the fourth layer, the UI layer, which contains
    the well-known UI frameworks **Blazor**, **gRPC**, **SignalR**, and **MVC**. This
    is where you will do most of your work as an ASP.NET Core developer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, above **MVC**, you will find **WebAPI** and **Razor Pages**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is covered in this book?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book doesn't cover all the topics mentioned in the architecture overview.
    This book covers most topics of the host layer because that is the layer that
    contains the most things you might need to customize. This book tackles middleware
    and routing, as well as MVC features and some more WebAPI topics, where you can
    do some magic tricks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the beginning of each chapter, we will indicate to which level the topic
    belongs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is not covered and why?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book doesn't cover Razor Pages, SignalR, gRPC, and Blazor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason is that gRPC and SignalR are already very specialized, and don't
    really need to be customized. Blazor is a new member of the ASP.NET Core family
    and is not widely used yet. Also, the author isn't familiar enough with Blazor
    to know all the screws to customize it. Razor Pages is on top of the MVC framework
    and customizations for MVC are also valid for Razor Pages.
