    (one of the first written stories we know is the Epic of Gilgamesh, dating back
    from Ancient Mesopotamia, 2100 BC). Theatre was born in Ancient Greece around
    600 BC. Even if we think about printed books (a much more recent invention), we
    are talking about centuries ago (Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press
    in 1440). Fast forward in time to the first decades of the last century, where
    motion pictures arose and films, as we know them today, were born. Television

    before 1970, and even back then, they weren't used as a form of storytelling.
    Complex stories, deep characters, profound themes began to appear later, in the
    late 80's, and flourished in the 90's. That is less than 40 years ago, just think
    about it! Many people still think that video games are just entertainment for
    kids and teenagers. Some players don't even consider themselves gamers, especially
    casual gamers that spend hours playing games such as Candy Crush Saga or Double
    Down Casino Slots. The generations born before the seventies didn't grow up with
    video games. But my generation, which is the generation of today's young adults
    born between the end of the seventies and the mid-eighties, was fully immersed
    in them. We witnessed the rise of game consoles and the birth of pretty much every
    video game franchise. Games are part of our life and culture.

    that some games are pretty abstract. Tetris comes immediately to mind, but any
    puzzle game or brain game is very unlikely to tell any kind of story. In a game
    such as Threes, the player only needs to slide numbered tiles on a four-by-four
    grid to combine addends and multiples of three. Of course, comparing those games
    to narrative rich games (or even to games with an extremely simple narrative,
    like the aforementioned Space Invaders) might give the impression that they don't
    have any narrative.

    Invention of Mechanics. Games such as The Sims or Far Cry are brilliant examples

    that games are what they are because they must be played first and foremost. On
    the other hand, game stories can evoke emotions as deep as those we feel by watching
    movies or reading books. It is a matter of opinions, but one thing is objective:
    stories and games work very well together. It''s the reason why so many games

    is the player, in our case). This is already huge. Also, stories provide a structure
    (usually with a beginning, a middle, and an end) through which gameplay moments
    can be organized. It provides a motivation to play that transcends the gameplay.
    Players will naturally want to know more about the plot, the characters, and the
    game world.

    played by humans to learn (and not only by humans; animals learn through play
    too!). Stories serve the same purpose. Games and stories are connected at a very
    deep level. Structuring one around the other will help you shape your design and,
    probably, make better games.

    also the characters that live in it.

    so many different stories have been told. For sure, there are other ways to tell
    a story, there's so much more still to discover and invent. But our advice is

    the story through their actions. Reading or listening notes and watching cutscenes
    should give an idea of a deeper immersion in the game world, but should never
    come before the actual gameplay. The idea is that, even in the most narrative-driven
    game, the player should be able to bolt through the game skipping any reading,
    listening, or cutscene...and still be able to make sense of the game story, simply

- en: In an open structure, story elements are associated with different physical
    places, so the player can wander around discovering and triggering different elements
    of the story. Sometimes, stories with an open structure might not even have a
    story arc and the player is in total control of the hero's journey. It's up to
    the player to decide when to confront the various challenges and how. The journey
    can even never get to a proper end. This is the form typical of simulation-based
    games, strategy games, and some open world-based games, such as massively multiplayer
    online role-playing games (MMORPGs).

    story that usually follow quite perfectly the three-act model. Even games without
    quests that rely on emergent gameplay, such as a Minecraft, generate stories that
    follow a classic model. The stories created by the player in the moment of playing
    the game do precisely this. Just try to listen to any player talking about a gameplay
    experience he had in any game. Is his story following a model familiar to you?

    opens up a new branch of the three, which now requires moving on in a different

    to track the decision, and this variable will only affect the nodes in which it
    is referenced.

    Conference [`https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022166`](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022166)).

    money) to sort out problems that could have been addressed early on with nearly
