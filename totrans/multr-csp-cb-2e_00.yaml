- en: Not so long ago, a typical personal computer CPU had only one computing core,
    and the power consumption was enough to cook fried eggs on it. In 2005, Intel
    introduced its first multiple-core CPU, and since then, computers started developing
    in a different direction. Low-power consumption and a number of computing cores
    became more important than a row computing core performance. This lead to programming
    paradigm changes as well. Now, we need to learn how to use all CPU cores effectively
    to achieve the best performance, and at the same time, we need to save battery
    power by running only the programs that we need at a particular time. Besides
    that, we need to program server applications in a way to use multiple CPU cores
    or even multiple computers as efficiently as possible to support as many users
    as we can.

- en: To be able to create such applications, you have to learn to use multiple CPU
    cores in your programs effectively. If you use the Microsoft .NET development
    platform and C#, this book will be a perfect starting point for you to program
    fast and responsive applications.

    and parallel programming in C#. We will start with the basic concepts, going through
    more and more advanced topics based on the information from previous chapters,
    and we will end with real-world parallel programming patterns, Universal Windows
    applications, and cross-platform applications samples.
