    from the ground up. You will gain the fundamental skills you need to set up your
    environment, and we will explain what .NET Mobile is before we transition into
    .NET MAUI to really take advantage of truly native cross-platform code.'

    consuming REST interfaces, real-time communication using SignalR, and location
    tracking using a device’s GPS. There is also room for machine learning, a touch
    of .NET Blazor, and the must-have to-do list.

    You don’t have to be a professional programmer, but you should have basic knowledge
    of object-oriented programming using .NET and C#. The typical reader would be
    someone who wants to explore how you can use .NET Mobile, and specifically .NET
    MAUI, to create applications using .NET and C#.

    help if you’ve worked with traditional .NET Mobile and want to take the step toward
    .NET MAUI.

    of views and view models. We will create a to-do app that supports navigation,
    filtering, and the addition of to-do items to a list, and will also render a user

    different methods for converting your Xamarin.Forms application to .NET MAUI.
    The first method will use a new .NET MAUI project and move our old Xamarin.Forms
    code into the new project, and the second method will use the **.NET Upgrade Assistant**
    tool to do some of the upgrades for us.'

    speed with the basic concepts of Xamarin in general. After that, you could pretty
    much pick any chapter you would like to learn more about. Each chapter is standalone
    but the chapters are ordered by complexity; the further you are into the book,
    the more complex the app will be.
