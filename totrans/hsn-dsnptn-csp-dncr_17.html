<li><strong>What do the terms late and early binding refer to?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Early binding is established when the source code is compiled while late binding is established while the component is running. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Does C# support multiple inheritance?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">No. The reasoning is that multiple inheritance leads to more complex source code.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>In C#, what level of encapsulation could be used to prevent access to a class from outside of the library?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The <kbd>internal</kbd> access modifier can be used to limit the visibility of a class to only within the library.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>What is the difference between aggregation and composition?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Both are types of association and the easiest way to differentiate the two is by whether or not the classes involved can exist without being associated. In a composition association, the classes involved have a tight life cycle dependency. This implies that, when one class is deleted, the associated classes are also deleted. </p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Can interfaces contain properties? (This is a bit of a tricky question)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">It is possible for an interface to define properties, but as an interface does have a body...</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>In SOLID, what does the S stand for? What is meant by a responsibility?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Single Responsibility Principle. Responsibility can be viewed as a reason for a change.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>What SDLC method is built around cycles: Waterfall or Agile?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Agile is built around the concept of the development process being conducted in a collection of cycles.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Is the decorator pattern a creational or structural pattern?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The decorator pattern is a structural pattern that allows functionality to be divided between classes and is particularly useful to enhance classes at runtime.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>What does pub-sub integration stand for?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Publish-Subscribe is a useful pattern where processes publish messages and other processes subscribe to receive the messages.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>In developing software for an organization, why is it sometimes difficult to determine requirements?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">There are many challenges to developing software for an organization. An example would be that changes in the organization's industry could cause the current requirements to need to be altered.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>What are two advantages and disadvantages of waterfall software development versus agile software development?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Waterfall software development provides an advantage over agile software development as it is simpler to understand and implement. In some situations, where the complexity and size of the project is smaller, Waterfall Software Development could be a better option over Agile Software Development. Waterfall Software Development, though, does not handle change well and, by having a larger scope, has more chance of requirements changing before the project is completed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>How does dependency injection help when writing unit tests?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">By injecting dependencies into a class, a class becomes easier to test as the dependencies are clearly known and more easily accessible.<em> </em></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Why is the following statement false? With TDD, you no longer need people to test a new software deployment.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Test-Driven Development helps to improve the quality of a solution by building a clear testing strategy into the software development life cycle. The tests defined, though, might not be complete, so there is still the need for additional resources to validate the delivered software.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Provide an example to show why using a singleton would not be a good mechanism for limiting access to a shared resource?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A singleton intentionally creates a bottleneck in an application. It is also one of the first patterns developers learn to use and, because of this, it is often used in situations where limiting access to the shared resource is not required.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Is the following statement true? Why or why not? <kbd>ConcurrentDictionary</kbd> prevents items in the collection from being updated by more than one thread at a time.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">For many C# developers, realizing that <kbd>ConcurrentDictionary</kbd> does not prevent items in the collection from being updated by more than one thread at a time is a painful lesson. <kbd>ConcurrentDictionary</kbd> protects a shared dictionary from being accessed and modified concurrently.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>What is a race condition and why should it be avoided?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A race condition is when the order of processing of multiple threads can culminate in different results.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>How does the factory pattern help simplify code?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The factory pattern is an effective way to decouple the creation of objects within an application.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Do .NET Core applications require third-party IoC containers?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">.NET Core has a powerful Inversion of Control built into the framework. It can be enhanced when required by other IoC containers, but is not required.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>If you are not sure what type of service lifetime to use, what type is it best to register a class as? Why?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Transient lifetime services are created each time they are requested. The majority of classes should be lightweight, stateless services, so this is the best service lifetime to use.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>In .NET Core ASP .NET solutions, a scope is defined per web request or per session?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A scope is per web request (connection).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Does registering a class as a Singleton in the .NET Core DI framework make it thread-safe?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">No, the framework will provide the same instance for subsequent requests, but does not make a class thread-safe.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Is it true that the .NET Core DI framework can only be replaced with other Microsoft-supplied DI frameworks?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Yes, there are many DI frameworks that can be used instead of the native DI framework.</p>

<li><strong>What is a web application?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">It's a program that uses a web browser and can be accessible from anywhere if available over public network. This works on a client/server architecture and serves the client by taking an HTTP request and providing an HTTP response.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Craft a web application of your choice and depict a pictorial view of the working of web application.</strong></li>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>What is Inversion of Control?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Inversion of Control</strong> (<strong>IoC</strong>) is a container to invert or delegate the control. It is based on the DI framework. .NET Core has a built-in IoC container.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>What is the UI/Architectural pattern? Which pattern you would like to use and why?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The UI Architectural pattern is designed to make a robust user interface to give user a better experience of the application. From the developer's point of view of point, MVC, MVP, and MVVM are the popular patterns.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>What are authentication and authorization?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Authentication is a process in which a system verifies or identifies the incoming requests through credentials (generally a user ID and password). If the system finds that the provided credentials are wrong, then it notifies the user (generally via a message on the GUI screen) and terminates the authorization process.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Authorization always comes after authentication. This is a process that allows the authenticated user who raised the request to access resources or data after verifying that they have access to the specific resources or data</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Is it safe to use authentication at the first level of a request and then allow incoming requests for restricted areas?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This is not always safe. As developers, we should take all necessary steps to make our application more secure. After first a level request, the authentication, the system should also check resource-level permissions.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>How you will prove that authorization always comes after authentication?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In a simple scenario of a web application, it first validates the user by asking for login credentials and then authorizes the user as per role to access specific resource.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>What is Test-Driven Development and why do developers care about it?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Test-Driven Development is a way to make sure that code is tested; it is like testing code by writing code. TDD is also known as Red/Blue/Green concepts. Developers should follow it to make their code/program work without any error.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Define TDD Katas. How does it help us to improve our TDD approach?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">TDD Katas are small scenarios or problems that help to learn to code by practice. You can take the example of Fizz Buzz Kata, where developers should apply coding to learn and practice TDD. If you want to practice TDD Katas, refer to this repository: <a href="https://github.com/garora/TDD-Katas">https://github.com/garora/TDD-Katas.</a></p>

<li class="mce-root"><strong>What is concurrent programming?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whenever things/tasks are happening at the same time, we say that tasks are happening concurrently. In our programming language, whenever any parts of our program run at the same time, it is concurrent programming.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>How does true parallelism happen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">True parallelism is not possible on a single CPU machine because tasks are not switchable, as it has a single core. It only happens on a machine with multiple CPUs (multiple cores).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>What is a race condition?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The potential for more than one thread to access the same shared data and update it with unpredictable results can be referred to as a race condition.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Why should we use <kbd>ConcurrentDictionary</kbd>?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A concurrent dictionary is a thread-safe collection class and stores key-value pairs. This class has implementation for a lock statement and provides a thread-safe class.</p>

<ol>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>What is functional programming?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Functional programming is an approach to symbolic computation in the same way as we solve mathematical problems. Any functional programming is based on mathematical functions. Any functional programming style language works on solutions with two terms: what to solve and how to solve?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>What is referential transparency in functional programming?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In functional programs, once we define the variables, they do not change their value throughout the program. As functional programs do not have assignment statements, if we need to store value, there is no alternative; instead, we define new variables.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>What is <kbd>Pure</kbd> function?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The <kbd>Pure</kbd> functions are the ones that strengthen functional programming by saying that they are pure. These functions work on two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>The end result/output will always remain the same for the provided parameters.</li>
<li>These will not impact the behavior of the program or the execution path of the application, even if they are being called a hundred times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>What is a stream?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A sequence of events is called a stream. A stream can emit three things: a value, an error, and a signal for completion.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>What are reactive properties?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Reactive properties are binding properties that react when an event triggers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>What is a reactive system?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">On the basis of the Reactive Manifesto, we can conclude that reactive systems are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><strong>Responsive</strong>: Reactive systems are event-based design systems because of this design approach; these systems are quick to respond to any request in a short time.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable</strong>: Reactive systems are reactive in nature. These systems can react to change the scalability rate by expanding or reducing the allocated resources.</li>
<li><strong>Resilient</strong>: A resilient system is one that would not stop, even if there is any failure/exception. Reactive systems are designed in such a way that, despite any exception or failure, the system will never die; it remains working.</li>
<li><strong>Message-based</strong>: Any data of an item represents a message and can be sent to a specific destination. When a message or data has arrived at a given state, an event that is a signal is emitted to notify that the message has been received. Reactive systems rely on this message-passing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>What is meant by merging two reactive streams?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Merging two reactive steams is actually combining elements of two similar or different reactive streams into a new reactive stream. For example, if you have <kbd>stream1</kbd>, and <kbd>stream2</kbd> then <kbd>stream3 = stream1.merge(stream2)</kbd>, but the sequence of <kbd>stream3</kbd> would not be in order.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>What is the MVVM pattern?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"> <strong>Model-View-ViewModel</strong> (<strong>MVVM</strong>) is one of the variations of <strong>Model-View-Controller</strong> (<strong>MVC</strong>) to meet the modern UI development approach, where UI development is the core responsibility of designer/UI-developers, rather than application developers. In this approach of development, a designer who is more of a graphical enthusiast and is focused on making the user interface more attractive may or may not bother about the development part of the application. Generally, designers (UI persons) use various tools to make the user interface more attractive. The MVVM is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><strong>Model</strong>: This is also called as a domain object and it holds data only; there is no business logic, validations, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>View</strong>: This is a representation of data for the end user.</li>
<li><strong>View Model</strong>: This separates View and Model; its main responsibility is to serve end users better stuff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>What is a ledger-style database?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This database is meant to insert operations only; there are no updates. Then, you create a view that aggregates the inserts together.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>What is CQRS?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Command Query Responsibility Segregation is a pattern that segregates the responsibilities between Query (to inserts) and Commands (to updates).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>When should you use CQRS?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">CQRS can be a good pattern to apply for task-based or event-driven systems, especially when the solution is composed of multiple applications and not a single monolithic website or application. It is <strong>a pattern and not an architecture</strong>, so it should be applied in specific cases and not in all business scenarios</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Is this a true statement? Most patterns have been developed recently and only apply to cloud-based applications.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">No, this is not true. Patterns have been evolving as software development changes but many of the core patterns have existed for decades.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>What does an ESB stand for? What type of architecture can it be used in: EDA, SOA, or monolithic?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">It stands for Enterprise Service Bus. It can be used effectively in event-driven architecture and service-oriented architecture.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Is queue-based load leveling is primarily used for DevOps, scalability, or availability?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Availability. Queue-based load leveling primarily used to handle large fluctuations in load by acting as a buffer to reduce the chance of an application becoming unavailable.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>What are the benefits of CI/CD? Would it be more beneficial in a large number of globally dispersed teams or a single small team of collocated developers?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In general, CI/CD helps to identify issues early in the development life cycle by frequently performing merges and deployments. Larger, more complex solutions, tend to show the benefits more than smaller, simpler solutions.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>In a website following static content hosting, does a browser retrieve images and static content directly through a CDN or does the web application retrieve the information on behalf of the browser?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A content delivery network can be used to improve performance and availability by caching static resources in multiple data centers, allowing for a browser to retrieve content directly from the closest data center.</p>

<li><strong>What is a practice? Give a few examples from our routine/daily life.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A practice may be one or more routine activities. To learn to drive, we should practice our driving. A practice is an activity that is not required to be memorized. There are a lot of examples of practice from our daily life: eating while watching TV shows, and so on. It does not break your rhythm to eat anything while you're watching your favorite TV show.</p>

<li><strong>We can achieve a specific coding skill with practice. Explain this.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Yes, we can achieve a specific coding skill with practice. The practice needs attention and consistency. For example, you want to learn Test-Driven Development. To do so, you need to learn it first. You can learn it by practicing TDD-Katas.</p>
