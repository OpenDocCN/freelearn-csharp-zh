                    <h1 class="header-title">Preface</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="NormalPACKT">Distributed systems are always hard to get complete success with. Lately, microservices are getting a considerable amount of attention. With Netflix and Spotify, microservice implementations have the become the biggest success stories in the industry. On the other hand, there are people who are of the opinion that microservices are nothing new or that they are only a rebranding of SOA.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">In any case, microservice architecture does have critical advantages—particularly with regard to empowering the agile improvement and conveyance of complex venture applications.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">However, there is no clear practical advice on how to implement microservices in the Microsoft ecosystem and, especially, by taking advantage of Azure and the .NET Core framework. This book tries to fill that void.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">It explores the concepts, challenges, and strengths around planning, constructing, and operating microservice architectures built with .NET Core 2.0. This book discusses all cross-cutting concerns along with the microservices design. It also highlights some important aspects to consider while building and operating microservices through practical <em>How Tos</em> and best practices for security, monitoring, and scalability.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What this book covers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="6126f4b5-7098-4bb4-891d-02065b4b5930.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>An Introduction to Microservices</em>, gets you familiar with microservice architectural styles, history, and how it differs from its predecessors: monolithic architecture and service-oriented architecture (SOA).</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="047f5d0b-a008-48e2-9c7f-c57c16e671f9.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Implementing Microservices</em>, discusses the different factors that can be used to identify and isolate microservices at a high level, what the characteristics of a good service are, and how to achieve the vertical isolation of microservices.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="568a0450-9c21-4b76-85b5-64972f4d5452.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Integration Techniques and Microservices</em>, gets you familiar with synchronous and asynchronous communication, types of collaborations, and the API gateway.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="fb7dddd5-e99d-4f2a-bca7-cb842ef47e63.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Testing Microservices</em>, explains how the testing of microservices is different from the testing of a normal .NET application. It gets you acquainted with the testing pyramid.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="6843b0a1-0287-4d15-9e72-fdf228e52604.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Deploying Microservices</em>, covers how to deploy microservices and best practices. It also takes into account the isolation factor, which is a key success factor, along with setting up continuous integration and continuous delivery to deliver business change at a rapid pace.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="a73faf53-8851-4445-b7ff-ea0dea802a84.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Securing Microservices</em>, explains how to make microservices secure with OAuth and takes you through container security and best practices in general.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="c6b62d03-b944-43ab-a0ac-41948625cf80.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Monitoring Microservices</em>, covers the debugging and monitoring of microservices, which is not a trivial problem but quite a challenging one, as there is no single tool in the .NET ecosystem that is, by design, made for microservices. However, Azure monitoring and troubleshooting is the most promising one.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="218a945b-42aa-4763-8a90-f3f0c0e742db.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Scaling Microservices</em>, explores scalability, which is one of the most critical advantages of pursuing the microservice architectural style. This chapter will explain scalability by design and by infrastructure with respect to the microservice architecture.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="274437a4-3708-4913-96b3-539e376c71fb.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Introduction to Reactive Microservices</em>, gets you familiar with the concept of reactive microservices. You will learn how to build reactive microservices with the use of a reactive extension. It will help you focus on your main task and free you from the chores of communicating across services.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="bcd6e14a-bd2b-4964-94f4-dcf93cc9d756.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Creating a Complete Microservice Solution</em>, walks you through all the concepts of microservices that you have learned so far. Then, we will develop an application from scratch while putting all the skills you have learned to use.</p>

<p>This book is for .NET Core developers who want to learn and understand the microservice architecture and implement it in their .NET Core applications. It’s ideal for developers who are completely new to microservices or just have a theoretical understanding of this architectural approach and want to gain a practical perspective in order to better manage application complexity.</p>
