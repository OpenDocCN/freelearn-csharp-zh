- en: In this part, you will continue game design for a 2D collection game, where
    you will create an environment and address level design in the GDD for the gameplay’s
    win/lose conditions. You will be introduce controlling the player character with
    the new Input System, the defined mechanics’ functionality for interacting with
    collectibles and hazards, and adding C# scripts (components) to GameObjects. You
    will learn how to create your own physics-based interactivity for a 2D game.
