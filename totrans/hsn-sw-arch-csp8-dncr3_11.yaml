    and .NET Core Implementation*, you will learn about the .NET Core implementation
    of well-known and general patterns and best practices, while [Chapter 11](4e308a45-a1ff-4a45-bea9-ba648b1e9ccd.xhtml), *Implementing
    Code Reusability in C# 8*, describes techniques and best practices that enhance
    code reusability.

    Different Domains in a Software Solution*, describes the modern domain-driven
    design software production methodology, which will enable you to get the most
    out of cloud- and microservice-based architectures and tackle complex applications
    that require several knowledge domains. There, you will learn both about analysis
    techniques and architectures and tools involved in projects based on domain-driven
    design.'

    ASP.NET Core MVC*, describe web architectures that form the backbone of modern
    enterprise applications. Both chapters are based on ASP.NET Core 3.0, which is
    the web framework that comes with .Net Core 3.0\. [Chapter 12](3ec4db7b-e570-41d0-94fb-2bdbd6dc4a9a.xhtml), *Applying
    Service-Oriented Architectures with .NET Core*, describes web architectures where
    the enterprise system can be accessed by external client applications through
    endpoints exposed on the web or on a private network. [Chapter 12](3ec4db7b-e570-41d0-94fb-2bdbd6dc4a9a.xhtml), *Applying
    Service-Oriented Architectures with .NET Core*, is dedicated to ASP.NET Core MVC
    web applications, which don''t need specific clients because they use browsers
    as clients. More specifically, they interact with the user through the HTML they
    send to a standard browser.'
