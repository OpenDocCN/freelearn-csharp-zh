Our goal with this book is not to try to give new definitions. We want to stay practical, therefore we'll go with the most intuitive definitions and leave it to you to discover all the studies and implications of those words. For the sake of simplicity, by gameplay, we mean how all the mechanics of your game contribute to creating the final experience played by the players.</p><p class="calibre_2">We're going to have a quick look at more specific definitions of what game mechanics are later in this chapter. Again, we're going to learn from other game designers and scholars who have already done an excellent job on this, with no pretense to reformulate our own definitions.</p><p class="calibre_2">Before learning how to create completely new game mechanics, we are going to focus on how to use existing mechanics and change and evolve them to suit your game and the gameplay you have envisioned. We have already talked about the fact that creating a new game doesn't always mean creating new and never-seen-before game mechanics. Understanding existing games and their mechanics and knowing how to deconstruct them and make them work for your game is the key to simplicity.</p><p class="calibre_2">In this chapter, we're going to learn how to use familiar game mechanics as a starting point to create your own and we will develop a useful framework that, once mastered, will allow you to tackle the challenge of creating something new and fresh based on familiar gameplay patterns.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_267"/>

All of them are equally correct and the different points of view complement each other. It is not our goal with this book to give a comprehensive definition, what's important is that a clear idea can stick in your designer mind by reading them!</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Mechanics are the various actions, behaviors, and control mechanisms afforded to the player within a game context.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">–'MDA: Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics Framework' by Hunicke, M.

Again, we are not going in-depth into these because this book is about the practical use of this knowledge more than the knowledge itself. Make sure to read the source articles and books from which we have taken these definitions; they are a must-read for every aspiring game designer.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_269"/>


<div id="filepos364483" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Examples of game mechanics</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Now that we have a better idea of what a game mechanic is in theory, let's have a look at some practical examples from famous games, just to clear any doubts that might still be there!</p><p class="calibre_2">We're going to start with extremely simple mechanics, without lingering too much on how they work. What follows is a list of examples to give you a practical idea of what a game mechanic is in a game.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_271"/>


<div id="filepos365124" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Jump!</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Probably the most famous mechanic of all. Super Mario Bros (1983) featured only two main mechanics: running and jumping.</p><p class="calibre_2">By pressing a button Mario can jump into the air, so he is able to stomp on enemies or reach platforms on different levels. That jump mechanic has been replicated in endless games and given birth to an entire genre: The Platformer. In the following image, we can see Mario in action:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00157.jpg" class="calibre_27"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Mario jumping in </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Super Mario World</span></span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_273"/>


<div id="filepos366012" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Shooting and reloading</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We have two mechanics here:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Shooting is the action of firing a weapon</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Reloading is the mechanic by which every now and then the player has to reload the gun to keep shooting</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Early shooter games didn't have any reloading involved, but modern shooter games might have quite complex reloading mechanics, each with their own unique gameplay implications.</p><p class="calibre_2">Imagine for example a classic FPS such as <span class="bold">Call of Duty</span> (<span class="bold">CoD</span>). Every weapon has a clip of ammunition that, once unloaded, has to be reloaded. This exposes the player to incoming attacks, creating a need for strategy for when to reload and a sense of danger in doing so: a fantastic game mechanic! See it in action as follows:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00103.jpg" class="calibre_28"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">In </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Call of Duty</span></span><span class="calibre4">, the player can press the reload button at any given time, commencing the action of reloading their weapon</span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Star Wars</span>: <span class="italic">Battlefront</span> uses a different approach. Firing a weapon for too long and too quickly causes overheat. Once overheated, a weapon cannot be used for a number of seconds. The final effect (dynamic) is clearly similar to the one we have in CoD—the overheated weapon exposes the player to attacks and creates a situation of danger, but the strategies are different. Unlike CoD, in <span class="italic">Star Wars: Battlefront</span> the player can pace their shooting in such a way that the weapon never overheats, at the expense of the fire rate:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00176.jpg" class="calibre_29"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">In </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Star Wars</span></span><span class="calibre4">: </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Battlefront</span></span><span class="calibre4"> a weapon doesn't need to be reloaded. However, if the player keeps shooting for too long, the weapon overheats and has to be cooled down by pressing the cooldown (reload) button at the right time</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_275"/>


<div id="filepos368587" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Action points</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Typical of turn-based games, action points are a widely used mechanic. The player has a budget of points that he can spend for doing actions (each action would be a separate mechanic, such as moving, using an ability, attacking an enemy, and so forth). Usually, this point also regenerates over time or each turn:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00105.jpg" class="calibre_30"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">In </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Hearthstone</span></span><span class="calibre4">, the player has a number of action points called </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Mana</span></span><span class="calibre4"> every turn. Each card he can play has a </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Mana</span></span><span class="calibre4"> cost.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_277"/>


<div id="filepos369557" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">List of common game mechanics</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Here is a practical list of game mechanics common to video games. It is by no means a comprehensive list, but it will help you better understand the meaning of the word mechanic in the context of video games:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Turns</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Different types of movements (running, crawling, flying)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Card drawing</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Time limit</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Resource collection/gathering</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Shooting</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">Switching weapons</li><li value="8" class="calibre_9">Pushing</li><li value="9" class="calibre_9">Pulling</li><li value="10" class="calibre_9">Dragging</li><li value="11" class="calibre_9">Shooting</li><li value="12" class="calibre_9">Winning condition</li><li value="13" class="calibre_9">Losing condition</li><li value="14" class="calibre_9">Rock-Paper-Scissors</li><li value="15" class="calibre_9">Randomly Generated Numbers</li><li value="16" class="calibre_9">Aiming</li><li value="17" class="calibre_9">Quick Time Events</li><li value="18" class="calibre_9">Score points</li><li value="19" class="calibre_9">Experience Points</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">There are hundreds of them. It is worth noticing that, as we have seen, a mechanic could be either an action that the player can perform or a more abstract rule of the game.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_279"/>


<div id="filepos371386" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Game mechanics interact with each other to develop dynamics</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The moment when a game really comes to life and triggers player's real emotions is when all the mechanics work together to create experiences. Usually, these interactions are called dynamics, such as in the case of the aforementioned <span class="italic">MDA Framework</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">The most striking difference between a mechanic and a dynamic is that a game designer has full control of the former but much less of the latter. It is only in the hands of players that dynamics can emerge from mechanics and it is the game designer's job to make sure this happens in the way they envisioned.</p><p class="calibre_2">Having less control doesn't mean that designing the mechanics and just hoping that they'll work will be enough. The fun of video games ultimately resides in dynamics, so getting them right is even more important than designing the core mechanics.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_281"/>


<div id="filepos372530" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Mechanics and dynamics are part of a feature</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">We know that mechanics are the atoms of our gameplay. We've learned that the interactions among our mechanics create dynamics, and now we can finally shed some light on the term <span class="italic">Feature</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">A game feature is an entire set of mechanics, and designing a feature means not only describing each mechanic but also how they will generate dynamics and interact when played with.</p><p class="calibre_2">Some feature examples are combat, multiplayer leaderboards, crafting, weapon upgrades, a world map, online mode, guilds, tournaments, and procedurally generated content; the list is limited only by the designer's imagination.</p><p class="calibre_2">Here's a list of common features with some examples in popular games:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><table valign="top" class="calibre7"><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">Character Creation  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">  <span class="italic">Skyrim</span>, <span class="italic">Pillars of Eternity</span>, <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">Combat System  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">  <span class="italic">Dark Soul</span>, <span class="italic">Call of Duty</span>, <span class="italic">Chess</span></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">Guild Wars  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">  <span class="italic">Clash of Clans</span>, <span class="italic">Lineage II</span></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">Crafting  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">  <span class="italic">Minecraft, The Witcher</span></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">Tournament  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">  <span class="italic">Overwatch, FIFA</span></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre8"><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">World Map  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre9">   <p class="calibre_2">  <span class="italic">Far Cry, Fallout</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2">It is important to know that some features can be formed by many other smaller features—In open world games the <span class="italic">open world</span> is usually described as a feature, but an open world includes smaller features such as world map, traveling, weather and time, encounters, and many, many others.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_283"/>


<div id="filepos375291" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Approaching mechanic design</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Now that we have some grasp of the theory behind game mechanics and dynamics and how they are the building blocks of game features, let's look at how to work on them.</p><p class="calibre_2">As we discussed in <a href="index_split_097.html#filepos293383"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 4</tt></span></a>, <span class="italic">Design Documentation</span>, every design process should start with the definition of some goals and requirements.</p><p class="calibre_2">When creating your mechanics, you should always keep in mind the following questions:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">What is the goal of the mechanic?</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Is the goal clear to the player?</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">What are the rules that affect the mechanic?</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">What is the feedback to the player?</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">The kind of game you are developing and its vision should guide you through the answers. Let's say you are working on an action medieval-fantasy game where melee combat is your core feature. The first mechanic you’ll be focusing on is probably going to be the action of attacking an enemy.</p><p class="calibre_2">What is the purpose of the combat system?</p><p class="calibre_2">Regardless of the theme of your game and its vision, the fact that we are talking about an action game already provides some insights.</p><p class="calibre_2">An action-oriented combat game challenges the player's physical skills and leverages their knowledge of the available game actions. So, one of the requirements would certainly be the use of the player's hand-eye coordination skills. It should also use memory skills, for pulling out combos or special attacks by pressing key combinations. The goal of such mechanics is usually to give to the player a skill-based system, easy to learn but difficult to master, to fight different enemies using different weapons and tactics.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_285"/>


<div id="filepos377580" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Rules and game mechanics</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Rules are extremely important to any game. According to different definitions of game mechanics, they might not be defined as mechanics themselves, but as a part of them. Rules for our combat system could be, for example, the number of attacks per second the player can perform. Rules can define constraints for actions or conditions to be respected (a victory condition, for example). Rules make games exciting because they determine the space in which the game's actions can take place.</p><p class="calibre_2">Imagine a Hide and Seek game where the seeker doesn't have to close his eyes while the other players are hiding. That would be the most boring Hide and Seek game ever! The rule that states the seeker has to close their eyes and count to a predetermined number is there to force a challenge that makes the game fun—a challenge for both the seeker, who can't look where players are hiding, and the hiders, who have a limited time to hide.</p><p class="calibre_2">We could say that this rule is not a mechanic in itself. The two main mechanics in Hide and Seek are for the seeker to <span class="italic">Seek</span> and for the hiders to <span class="italic">Hide</span>. The rule is part of the <span class="italic">Seek</span> mechanic, but nonetheless is a fundamental part of the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">It might be difficult to distinguish between a mechanic and a rule; again, this would be a theoretical effort, which we don't want to tackle in this book.</p><p class="calibre_2">What is important is that you understand that mechanics and rules need to come together and be considered at the same time while designing a game.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_287"/>


<div id="filepos379458" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Mechanics and dynamics produce feedback</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Finally, there is feedback, probably the most important part of a game mechanic in video games.</p><p class="calibre_2">Wikipedia gives the following definition of video games:</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">"A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device".</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The word <span class="italic">feedback</span> is part of the very definition of video games.</p><p class="calibre_2">We could argue that the Wikipedia definition is not complete (or up to date), as that feedback is not necessarily visual. It can well be audio or even haptic (the most traditional haptic feedback is the vibration of a console controller, but haptic feedback and devices are evolving at an incredible pace with the growth of virtual reality).</p><p class="calibre_2">Feedback is everywhere in video games and is at the core of any game mechanic. For every player's action, there must correspond a change in the game that is immediately appreciable.</p><p class="calibre_2">The fact that <span class="italic">Mario</span> jumps on the screen when you hit a specific button on the controller is a feedback, as is the iconic <span class="italic">bounce</span> sound that he makes.</p><p class="calibre_2">Feedback is not limited to the player's immediate actions though. An <span class="bold">Experience Points</span> (<span class="bold">XP</span>) progress bar is a visual feedback that provides the player valuable information about how many XP points they need for the next level. More importantly, that XP bar could flash and make a little progress every time the player accomplishes an action that rewards XP. This is a fantastic way to teach the player about cause-effect relations in the game:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00010.jpg" class="calibre_31"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">The result screen at the end of every match in </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Overwatch</span></span><span class="calibre4"> is full of visual feedback. It does an excellent job in providing information about the player's performance, progression, and what is about to happen now that the match is over.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Feedback is also essential to understand the game's world and logic. Imagine if the same action performed in the same circumstances doesn't produce the same result (and feedback) every time. That would be extremely frustrating for the player and undermine the fun of the game. For example, you know that you can fire your weapon in a shooter game with a specific button, let's say <span class="italic">R2</span> on a PlayStation's controller. Every time you press that button, you expect your weapon to shoot. If once in a while, the same button produces a different effect, such as for example throwing your weapon at the enemy instead of shooting, we would have an infuriated player. For the same reason, if the weapon is jammed or must be reloaded before shooting, we expect the game to somehow tell us that the shooting is not available and that we need to reload. The outcome of pressing the same button, in this case, would actually be different (shoot if the weapon is loaded, don't if it's not), but the feedback given to the player must describe what is going on as best as possible.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_289"/>


<div id="filepos383098" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Finding the right reference</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">How can you create a game mechanic based on an existing one? How do you find the right reference to start creating your own?</p><p class="calibre_2">The first step is to look for games that include mechanics and features similar to what you are envisioning for your game. Your game concept should give you a clear idea of which games you should look at.</p><p class="calibre_2">At this point, you should have a clear idea of who your competitors are (as we have seen in <a href="index_split_047.html#filepos149451"><span class="calibre3"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 2</tt></span></a>, <span class="italic">Game Concept</span>) and it is important to look at your competition's game mechanics with special attention.

When you want to understand a mechanic from an existing game, a great way to understand how it is made is to ask an engineer for their opinion on how he or she thinks it has been implemented. How does it work at a technical level? Getting insights on this kind of question could reveal a lot about a game mechanic!</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Now that we have deconstructed the Jump mechanic in <span class="italic">Super Mario</span>, let's take another popular platform game that clearly took inspiration from the Mario: <span class="italic">Super Meat Boy</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">In <span class="italic">Super Meat Boy</span> the core mechanic remains the Jump action. How did the developers make a completely new and fresh game out of it?</p><p class="calibre_2">First of all the gravity rule that affects Mario's jump is simplified: <span class="italic">Super Meat Boy's</span> jumps are symmetrical as the speed going up is the same as the speed going down.</p><p class="calibre_2">At a first glance this seems a tiny, insignificant detail, but in reality, this simplification allows <span class="italic">Meat Boy</span> to be more reactive and controllable, with his jumps much more predictable than Mario's.</p><p class="calibre_2">No wonder <span class="italic">Super Meat Boy</span> is a much more fast-paced game.</p><p class="calibre_2">The predictability of <span class="italic">Meat Boy's</span> jumps serves another purpose: the player is often required to make a series of jumps which involves platforms that are off-screen at the moment he starts the sequence. So he has to take decisions and actions in a matter of milliseconds - something you can’t so easily do with the weight and physics of Mario.</p><p class="calibre_2">Another distinctive addition to <span class="italic">Super Meat Boy's</span> jump mechanic is Wall Jumping. By landing a Jump on a wall is possible to immediately Jump again in an upward and opposite direction from the wall. This is a simple addition that enables dynamics such as vertical climbing, and therefore creates a completely different and new game.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_293"/>

Expanding and improving existing game mechanics is the lifeblood of game design as much as introducing new groundbreaking ones.</p><p class="calibre_2">Subtractive game design though is probably even more important.</p><p class="calibre_2">We talked already about the <span class="italic">Less is more</span> principle and how it should be applied throughout the whole design and its documentation. Applying this principle in game mechanics is not only a matter of elegance; it can help game designers to discover (or re-discover) the fun at the core of game mechanics and their ease of use.</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">'Subtractive design is the process of removing imperfections and extraneous parts in order to strengthen the core elements. You can think of a design as something you build up, construct and let grow, but it's pruning away the excess that gives a design a sense of simplicity, elegance, and power.'</span></span></p><p class="calibre_118"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">– David Sirlin, Game Designer</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Subtractive design and examples of how it can transform good games into great games are everywhere in the history of video games.</p><p class="calibre_2">Valve's game <span class="italic">Portal</span> is a fantastic example of minimal game design. In <span class="italic">Portal</span>, you can open two different kinds of portals using a Portal Gun—orange portals and blue portals. The core mechanic is that you can enter an orange portal and come out from the Blue portal. You have no actual weapons, there is no inventory screen, there are no NPCs or enemies (with the exception of the turrets and the final boss). The controls are ultra-simplified, with action buttons only for moving, shooting the two kinds of portals, jumping, and carrying objects:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00019.jpg" class="calibre_34"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">The portal mechanic in </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Portal</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Portal's levels contain practically nothing except for elements that are part of puzzles, visual cues as hints about what you should do, and elements related to the story. This minimalistic design puts all the emphasis on the portal mechanic itself, which is incredibly fun. Basically, all you can do is shoot portals and move between them to solve puzzles. The fact that there are no other core mechanics in the game allows the designer to fully explore all the possibilities of the Portal mechanic, focusing on what is really fun for the player and staying away from anything distracting or out of context.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_295"/>

Most likely you are in some sort of prototyping phase. Especially with core mechanics, the only way to test your hypothesis (of fun) is to play them.</p><p class="calibre_2">We will discuss later how to effectively prototype game mechanics and flows. For now, it is important that you understand that the process of creating new mechanics goes hand in hand with working software.</p><p class="calibre_2">The only way to know if your character's jump needs to follow a realistic physic or not, what the speed at which it is performed should be, and the maximum height is to play the game and feel whether your design assumptions were right or not.</p><p class="calibre_2">Or to better (and more realistically) put it, to see how they were wrong.</p><p class="calibre_2">In this iterative process of adding and subtracting elements from your mechanics and tweaking their values you will eventually find the perfect gameplay feeling and finally fix it into your GDD...or fail and realize that some of your assumptions were wrong—don't be scared of failure though.
