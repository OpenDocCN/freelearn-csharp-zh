<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>Distributed systems are always hard to get complete success with. Lately, microservices are getting a considerable amount of attention. With Netflix and Spotify, microservice implementations have the become the biggest success stories in the industry. On the other hand, there are people who are of the opinion that microservices are nothing new or that they are only a rebranding of SOA.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>In any case, microservice architecture does have critical advantages—particularly with regard to empowering the agile improvement and conveyance of complex venture applications.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>However, there is no clear practical advice on how to implement microservices in the Microsoft ecosystem and, especially, by taking advantage of Azure and the .NET Core framework. This book tries to fill that void.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>It explores the concepts, challenges, and strengths around planning, constructing, and operating microservice architectures built with .NET Core 2.0. This book discusses all cross-cutting concerns along with the microservices design. It also highlights some important aspects to consider while building and operating microservices through practical <em>How Tos</em> and best practices for security, monitoring, and scalability.</span></p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="568a0450-9c21-4b76-85b5-64972f4d5452.xhtml"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><span>Chapter 3</span></span></a><span>, <em>Integration Techniques and Microservices</em>, gets you familiar with synchronous and asynchronous communication, types of collaborations, and the API gateway.</span></p>

It gets you acquainted with the testing pyramid.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="6843b0a1-0287-4d15-9e72-fdf228e52604.xhtml"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><span>Chapter 5</span></span></a><span>, <em><span class="ItalicsPACKT">Deploying Microservices</span></em>, covers how to deploy microservices and best practices.

However, Azure monitoring and troubleshooting is the most promising one.</span></p>

<p>This book is for .NET Core developers who want to learn and understand the microservice architecture and implement it in their .NET Core applications. It’s ideal for developers who are completely new to microservices or just have a theoretical understanding of this architectural approach and want to gain a practical perspective in order to better manage application complexity.</p>

<pre> "ConnectionStrings": {<br/>    "ProductConnection": "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=ProductsDB;Integrated Security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True"<br/>  }</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>Install-Package System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt</strong></pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong><span> </span>and<span> </span><strong>important words</strong><span> </span>are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Next</span><span> </span>button moves you to the next screen."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p>
