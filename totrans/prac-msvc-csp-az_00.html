			<p><strong class="bold">.NET Aspire</strong> is a new, opinionated framework offering tools and libraries for creating microservices with .NET, no matter whether they should run on-premises, on Microsoft Azure, or in any other cloud environment. In this book, you will learn how to get the most out of .NET Aspire when you build <span class="No-Break">your solutions.</span></p>
			<p>Creating ASP.NET Core minimal APIs (an easy and fast option for creating REST services) is just a small part of creating applications using a microservices-based architecture. This book covers all the different aspects that are needed for building a successful solution. Accessing databases, both relational as well as NoSQL; using Docker and deploying Docker images; automatic deployment with GitHub actions; monitoring the solution with logging, metrics data, and distributed tracing; creating unit tests, integration tests, and load tests; automatically publishing the solution to different environments; and using binary, real-time, and asynchronous communication – all of this is covered in <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
			<p>Through the code provided in this book, you’ll work on a backend solution to run a cool game. From <a href="B21217_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, you’ll already have usable and testable functionality, and it will be enhanced chapter by chapter to cover all the important aspects relating to microservices. If you don’t want to work through each chapter in sequence, we have provided code that you can start with for <span class="No-Break">each chapter.</span></p>
			<p>The application can run deployed to Microsoft Azure, using several Azure services such as Azure Container Apps, Container Registry, Cosmos DB, App Configuration, Key Vault, Redis, and SignalR Service. It can also run in an on-premises environment on a Kubernetes cluster using Kafka, Redis, and <span class="No-Break">other resources.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you’ll have become confident in implementing a stable, performant, and scalable solution and using various Azure services that are great for hosting such a service-based solution. While the solution of the book is a game, the knowledge learned will help you to create any business-related <span class="No-Break">service architecture.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>The book is for developers and software architects who are familiar with C# and .NET, have basic knowledge of Microsoft Azure, and want to know about all the aspects required for creating modern microservices with .NET and <span class="No-Break">Microsoft Azure.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B21217_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to .NET Aspire and Microservices</em>, gives you an introduction to <strong class="bold">.NET Aspire</strong>, as well as tools and libraries that can be of great help when creating microservices. You’ll start an initial .NET Aspire project, and we will look at what it consists of and the parts of .NET Aspire you can take advantage of. You’ll see the services that the Codebreaker application (this is the solution we are going to build in all the chapters of the book) is made up of and learn about the services that are used with <span class="No-Break">Microsoft Azure.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Minimal APIs – Creating REST Services</em>, acts as the kick-off for creating the Codebreaker application. You will learn how to use the <strong class="bold">ASP.NET Core minimal API</strong> technology to efficiently create REST services, use OpenAPI to describe the services, and test the services with <span class="No-Break">HTTP files.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor063"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Writing Data to Relational and NoSQL Databases</em>, uses just the in-memory storage in <a href="B21217_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a> and adds database storage using <strong class="bold">Azure SQL</strong> and <strong class="bold">Azure Cosmos DB</strong>, comparing relational to non-relational databases and using <strong class="bold">EF Core</strong> with <span class="No-Break">both variants.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Libraries for Client Applications</em>, adds client libraries to access the services, with one variant using an HTTP client factory and another making use of <strong class="bold">Kiota</strong> to automatically generate code for <span class="No-Break">the client.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Containerization of Microservices</em>, dives into all the important concepts of <strong class="bold">Docker</strong> and how to create Docker images from the services created so far. You will learn the concepts of Docker before using the .NET CLI to create Docker images. A <strong class="bold">.NET native AOT</strong> version of a service will be created that allows for creating Docker images without a .NET runtime, just <span class="No-Break">native code.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor137"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Microsoft Azure for Hosting Applications</em>, as Docker images have been created in the previous chapter, will now cover how to publish the application to an <strong class="bold">Azure Container Apps</strong> environment. Before that, important concepts of Azure are covered. Then, Azure resources will be created with the help of the Azure Developer CLI and .<span class="No-Break">NET Aspire.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor162"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Flexible Configurations</em>, dives into the .NET configuration. You’ll understand configuration providers with .NET, learn how configuration applies to the app model of .NET Aspire, add configurations and secrets with Azure Container Apps, and integrate <strong class="bold">Azure App Configuration</strong> and <strong class="bold">Azure Key Vault</strong>. For easier access without the need to store secrets, <strong class="bold">Azure managed identities</strong> are covered here <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">CI/CD – Publishing with GitHub Actions</em>, builds on the fact that continuous integration and continuous delivery are important aspects of a microservices solution. This chapter covers how to automatically build and test applications with <strong class="bold">GitHub actions</strong> and how to automatically update solutions running on Microsoft Azure. To support modern deployment patterns, feature flags available with Azure App Configuration are integrated in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Authentication and Authorization with Service and Clients</em>, covers two versions to authenticate and authorize applications and users: integration of <strong class="bold">Azure Active Directory B2C</strong> for the cloud version of the Codebreaker solution and <strong class="bold">ASP.NET Core identities</strong> for the on-premises solution. To avoid dealing with authentication with every service, a gateway using <strong class="bold">YARP</strong> <span class="No-Break">is created.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor239"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">All About Testing the Solution</em>, states that no change should break the application and errors should be detected as early as possible. In this chapter, you will learn about creating unit tests, integration tests with .NET Aspire (which makes testing a lot simpler), and using <strong class="bold">Playwright</strong> for <span class="No-Break">end-to-end tests.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor263"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Logging and Monitoring</em>, delves into what is going on in the Codebreaker application. Memory leaks should be detected early. During development, we should look into the details of how the application communicates. This chapter covers efficient high-performance logging, writing custom metrics data, and distributed tracing – including the coverage of <strong class="bold">OpenTelemetry</strong> and how this integrates with .NET Aspire. In this chapter, we use <strong class="bold">Prometheus</strong> and <strong class="bold">Grafana</strong> for the on-premises solution and <strong class="bold">Azure Application Insights</strong> and <strong class="bold">Azure Log Analytics</strong> with <span class="No-Break">the cloud.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor294"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Scaling Services</em>, delves into scaling services, which is one of the important reasons for using a microservices architecture. Using <strong class="bold">Azure Load Testing</strong>, we create a huge load on the main service of the application and find out what the bottlenecks are, decide between scaling up and scaling out, and add caching to increase performance <span class="No-Break">using Redis.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor317"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Real-Time Messaging with SignalR</em>, covers informing clients in real time using <strong class="bold">SignalR</strong>. Using a REST API, a SignalR hub is invoked, passing real-time information about completed games, and the SignalR hub passes on this information to a group of clients. <strong class="bold">Azure SignalR Service</strong> is used to reduce the load from <span class="No-Break">the services.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor330"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">gRPC for Binary Communication</em>, increases the performance by changing communication to <strong class="bold">gRPC</strong> with service-to-service communication. You will learn how to create a Protocol Buffers definition, implement services and clients using this binary platform-independent communication, and how .NET service discovery and .NET Aspire can be used <span class="No-Break">with gRPC.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor349"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Asynchronous Communication with Messages and Events</em>, deals with the fact that often answers are not required immediately after the request is sent – message queues and events come into play. Here, <strong class="bold">Azure message queues</strong>, <strong class="bold">Azure Event Hubs</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Kafka</strong> for an on-premises environment come into play to <span class="No-Break">be used.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21217_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor373"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Running Applications On-Premises and in the Cloud</em>, discusses what’s needed in a production environment when running on Azure, what the differences between production and development environments are, and how the Codebreaker application fulfills requirements relating to scalability, reliability, and security. Up to this chapter, the application was running either on the local development system or within an Azure Container Apps environment. In this chapter, the application is deployed to <strong class="bold">Azure Kubernetes Service</strong> and can be deployed in a similar way to an on-premises Kubernetes cluster using the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Aspir8</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> tool.</span></p>

			<p><em class="italic">Part 1</em> introduces the fundamental functionality of a microservices application. Before delving into the development of the Codebreaker application, you will explore .NET Aspire - a new cloud-ready stack for service construction. This section covers the technology’s offerings, essential features, an introduction to Microsoft Azure, and an overview of the components comprising the Codebreaker application. Subsequently, you will engage in coding using ASP.NET Core minimal APIs, crafting code for data interaction with both relational and NoSQL databases through <strong class="bold">Entity Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">EF</strong>) Core, utilizing Azure Cosmos DB and SQL Server, and generating client libraries to access the REST service. One approach involves leveraging the HTTP client factory, while the other employs <span class="No-Break">Microsoft Kioata.</span></p>
