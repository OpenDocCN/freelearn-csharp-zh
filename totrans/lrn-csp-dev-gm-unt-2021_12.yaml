    game progress, or online multiplayer scoreboards. Your favorite game also manages
    internal data, meaning the programmers used hardcoded information to build levels,
    keep track of enemy stats, and write helpful utilities. In other words, data is

    update a file, our data is converted into an array of bytes, which are then streamed
    to or from the file using a `Stream`. The data stream is responsible for carrying
    the data as a sequence of bytes to or from a file, acting as a translator or intermediary
    for us between our game application and the data files themselves.

    that means is some processes in your code will put computing power and memory
    on a sort of layaway plan where you can't touch it. These processes will wait
    until you explicitly tell your program or game to close and return the layaway
    resources to you so you're back to full power. Streams are one such process, and
    they need to be closed after you're done using them. If you don't properly close
    your streams, your program will keep using those resources even though you're
    not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Luckily, C# has a handy interface called `IDisposable` that all `Stream` classes
    implement. This interface only has one method, `Dispose()`, which tells the stream
    when to give you back the resources it's been using.

- en: When it comes to serializing and deserializing JSON, Unity and C# aren't completely
    in sync. Essentially, C# has its own `JsonSerializer` class that works the exact
    same way as the `XmlSerializer` class we used in the previous examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to access the JSON serializer, you need the `System.Text.Json` `using`
    directive. Here's the rub—Unity doesn't support that namespace. Instead, Unity
    uses the `System.Text` namespace and implements its own JSON serializer class
    called `JsonUtility`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because our project is in Unity, we're going to work with Unity's supported
    serialization class. However, if you're working with a non-Unity C# project, the
    concepts are the same as the XML code we just wrote.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `ToJson()` method we're using takes in the `sword` object we want to serialize
    and a Boolean value of `true` so the string is pretty printed with proper indenting.
    If we didn't specify a `true` value, the JSON would still print out, it would
    just be a regular string, which isn't easily readable.

    lists or arrays by themselves. Any list or array needs to be part of a class object
    for Unity's `JsonUtility` class to recognize and handle it correctly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    by itself or combined to suit your project's needs. For example, you could use
    text files to store character dialogue and only load it when you need to. This
    would be more efficient than having the game keep track of it every time it runs,
    even when the information isn't being used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could also put character data or enemy statistics into either an XML or
    JSON file and read from the file anytime you need to level up a character or spawn
    a new monster. Finally, you could fetch data from a third-party database and serialize
    it into your own custom classes. This is a super common scenario with storing
    player accounts and external game data.

    delete files. You also learned how to effectively work with text, XML, and JSON
    data formats, as well as data streams. And you know how to take an entire object's
    state and serialize or deserialize it into both XML and JSON. All in all, learning
    these skills was no small feat. Don't forget to review and revisit this chapter
    more than once; there's a lot here that might not become second nature on the
    first run-through.
