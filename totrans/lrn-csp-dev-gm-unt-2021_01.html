    <h1 id="_idParaDest-13" class="chapterTitle">Getting to Know Your Environment</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Pop culture often markets computer programmers as outsiders, lone wolves, or geeky hackers. People possessing extraordinary mental gifts for algorithmic thought, little social IQ, and the odd anarchic bent. While this is not the case, there is something to the idea that learning to code fundamentally changes the way you look at the world. The good news is your naturally curious mind already wants to see these kinds of patterns in the world, and you may even come to enjoy this new way of thinking.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">From the moment your eyes snap open in the morning to the last glimpse of your ceiling fan before you go to sleep, you're unconsciously using analytical skills that translate to programming—you're just missing the right language and syntax to map those life skills into code. You know your age, right? That's a variable. When you cross the street, I presume you look down the road in both directions before stepping off the curb like the rest of us. That's evaluating different conditions, better known as control flow in programming terminology. When you look at a can of pop, you instinctively identify that it has certain properties like shape, weight, and contents. That's a class object! You get the idea.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">With all that real-world experience at your fingertips, you're more than ready to cross over into the realm of programming. To kick off your journey, you'll need to know how to set up your development environment, work with the applications involved, and know exactly where to go when you need help.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">To those ends, we're going to begin by delving into the following C# topics:</p>&#13;
    <ul>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Getting started with Unity 2021</li>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Using C# with Unity</li>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Exploring the documentation</li>&#13;
    </ul>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let's get started!</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-14" class="title">Technical requirements</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Sometimes it's easier to start with what a thing isn't, rather than what it is. The goal of this book <em class="italic">isn't</em> to teach you everything there is to know about the Unity game engine or game development. By necessity, we'll cover these topics at a basic level at the beginning of our journey, and in more detail in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Getting Your Hands Dirty with Unity</em>. However, these topics are included to provide a fun, accessible way to learn the C# programming language from the ground up. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Since this book is aimed at complete beginners to programming, if you have no previous experience with either C# or Unity, you're in the right place! If you've had some experience with the Unity Editor but not with programming, guess what? This is still the place to be. Even if you've dabbled in a bit of C# mixed with Unity, but want to explore some more intermediate or advanced topics, the later chapters of this book can provide you with what you're looking for.</p>&#13;
    <div>&#13;
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">If you're an experienced programmer in other languages, feel free to skip the beginner theory and dive right into the parts you're interested in, or stick around and refresh your fundamentals.</p>&#13;
    </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In addition to running Unity 2021, you'll also be using C# 8.0 and Visual Studio to write your game code.</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-15" class="title">Getting started with Unity 2021</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you don't have Unity installed, or are running an earlier version, follow these steps to set up your <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>environment:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">There's always a <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>chance of something going wrong, so be sure to check the following section if you're using macOS Catalina or later, which has been known to throw up issues.</p>&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-16" class="title">Using macOS</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you're working on a Mac with OS Catalina or later, there is a known issue when using some versions <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>of Unity Hub to install Unity. If that's the case for you, take a deep breath, go to the <strong class="screenText">Unity download archive</strong>, and grab the 2021 version you need (<a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive">https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive</a>). Remember to use the <strong class="screenText">Downloads (Mac)</strong> option instead of the Unity Hub download:</p>&#13;

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.10: Unity download archive</p>&#13;
    <p>&#13;
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">If you're working on Windows and run into similar install issues, downloading an archived copy of Unity will also work just fine.</p>&#13;
    </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The download is a <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>normal application installer since it's a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.dmg</code> file. Open it up, follow the instructions, and you'll be ready to go in no time!</p>&#13;

      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">All of the examples and screenshots for this book were created and captured using Unity 2021.1.0b8. If you're using a newer version, things might look slightly different in the Unity Editor, but this shouldn't affect your following along.</p>&#13;
    </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now that Unity Hub and Unity 2021 are installed, it's time to create a new project!</p>&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-17" class="title">Creating a new project</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Launch the Unity Hub application to start a new project. If you have a Unity account, go ahead and sign in; if not, you <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>can either create one or hit <strong class="screenText">Skip</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now, let's set up a new project by selecting the arrow icon next to the <strong class="screenText">NEW</strong> button in the top right corner:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17573_01_12.png" alt="" width="826" height="429"/></figure>&#13;
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.12: Unity Hub Projects panel</p>&#13;

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.13: Unity Hub with new project configuration popup</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">With the project created, you're all set <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>to explore the Unity interface! You can re-open your project anytime from the <strong class="screenText">Projects</strong> panel in Unity Hub.</p>&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-18" class="title">Navigating the editor</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">When the new <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>project finishes initializing, you'll see the glorious Unity Editor! I've marked the important tabs (or panels, if you prefer) in the following screenshot:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17573_01_14.png" alt="" width="827" height="438"/></figure>&#13;
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.14: Unity interface</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This is a lot to take in, so we'll look at each of these panels in more detail:</p>&#13;
    <ol>&#13;
      <li class="numbered" value="1">The <strong class="screenText">Toolbar</strong> panel is the topmost part of the Unity Editor. From here, you can manipulate <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>objects (far-left button group) and play and pause the game (center buttons). The rightmost button group contains Unity services, <strong class="keyword">LayerMasks</strong>, and layout scheme features, which we won't be using in this book because they don't apply to learning C#.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numbered">The <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong> window shows every item currently in the game <strong class="keyword">scene</strong>. In the starter project, this is just <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>the default camera and directional light, but when we create our prototype environment, this window will start to get filled in.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numbered">The <strong class="screenText">Game</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Scene</strong> windows are the most visual aspects of the editor. Think of the <strong class="screenText">Scene</strong> <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>window as your stage, where you <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>can move and arrange 2D and 3D objects. When you hit the <strong class="screenText">Play</strong> button, the <strong class="screenText">Game</strong> window will take over, rendering <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>the <strong class="screenText">Scene</strong> view and any programmed interactions.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numbered">The <strong class="screenText">Inspector</strong> window is your one-stop shop for viewing and editing the properties of <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>objects in the scene. If you select the <strong class="screenText">Main Camera</strong> <strong class="keyword">GameObject</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong>, you'll see several parts (Unity calls them components) are displayed—all of which are accessible from here.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numbered">The <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> window holds every asset that's currently in your project. Think of this as a <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>representation of your project's folders and files.</li>&#13;
      <li class="numbered">The <strong class="screenText">Console</strong> window is where any output we want our scripts to print will show up. From <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>here on out, if we talk about the console or debug output, this panel is where it will be displayed.</li>&#13;
    </ol>&#13;
    <p>&#13;
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">If any of these windows get closed by accident, you can re-open them anytime from <strong class="screenText">Unity</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> | <strong class="screenText">General</strong>. You can find more in-depth breakdowns of <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>each window's functionality in the Unity docs at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html</a>.</p>&#13;
    </p>&#13;
    <p class="bullet-para">Before continuing, it's important that Visual Studio is set up as the script editor for your project. Go to <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>the <strong class="screenText">Unity menu</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Preferences</strong> | <strong class="screenText">External Tools</strong> and check that <strong class="screenText">External Script Editor</strong> is set to Visual Studio for Mac or Windows:</p>&#13;

    <p class="normal">I know that was a lot to process if you're new to Unity, but rest assured that any instructions going forward will always reference the necessary steps. I won't leave you wondering what button to push. With that out of the way, let's start creating some actual C# scripts.</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-19" class="title">Using C# with Unity</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Going forward, it's important to think of Unity and C# as symbiotic entities. Unity is the engine where you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>create scripts and game objects, but the actual programming <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>takes place in another program called Visual Studio. Don't worry about that right now—we'll get to that in a moment.</p>&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-20" class="title">Working with C# scripts</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Even though we haven't covered any basic programming concepts yet, they won't have a home until we <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>know how to create an actual C# script in Unity. A C# script is a special kind of C# file in which you'll write C# code. These scripts can be used in Unity to do virtually anything, from responding to player input to creating game mechanics.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">There are several ways to create C# scripts from the editor:</p>&#13;
    <ul>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Select <strong class="screenText">Assets</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Create</strong> | <strong class="screenText">C# Script</strong></li>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Right under the <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> tab, select the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> icon and choose <strong class="screenText">C# Script</strong></li>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Right-click <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>on the <strong class="screenText">Assets</strong> folder in the <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> tab and select <strong class="screenText">Create</strong> | <strong class="screenText">C# Script</strong> from the pop-up menu</li>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Select any GameObject in the <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong> window and click <strong class="screenText">Add Component</strong> | <strong class="screenText">New Script</strong></li>&#13;
    </ul>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Going forward, whenever you're instructed to create a C# script, please use whichever method you prefer.</p>&#13;
    <p>&#13;
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Resources and objects other than C# scripts can be created in the editor using the preceding methods. I'm not going to call out each of these variations every time we create something new, so just keep the options in the back of your mind. </p>&#13;
    </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">For the sake of organization, we're going to store our various assets and scripts inside their marked folders. This isn't just a Unity-related task—it's something you should always do, and your coworkers will thank you (I promise):</p>&#13;
    <ol>&#13;
      <li class="numbered" value="1">From the <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> tab, select <strong class="screenText">+</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Folder</strong> (or whichever method you like best—in <em class="italic">Figure 1.17</em> we've selected <strong class="screenText">Assets</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Create</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Folder</strong>) and name it <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Scripts</code>:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17573_01_17.png" alt="" width="525" height="576"/></figure>&#13;
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.17: Creating a C# script</p>&#13;
      </li>&#13;
      <li class="numbered">Double-click on the <strong class="screenText">Scripts</strong> folder and create a new C# script. By default, the script will be <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">NewBehaviourScript</code>, but you'll see the filename highlighted, so you have the option to immediately rename it. Type in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">LearningCurve</code> and hit <kbd class="keyStroke">Enter</kbd>:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17573_01_18.png" alt="" width="751" height="320"/></figure>&#13;

    </ol>&#13;
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.18: Project window with the Scripts folder selected</p>&#13;
    <p>&#13;
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">You can use the small slider in the bottom right of the <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> tab to change how your files are displayed.</p>&#13;
    </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">So, you've just <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>created a subfolder named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Scripts</code>, as shown in the preceding screenshot. Inside that parent folder, you created a C# script named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">LearningCurve.cs</code> (the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.cs</code> file type stands for C-Sharp, in case you were wondering), which is now saved as part of our <em class="italic">Hero Born</em> project assets. All that's left to do is open it up in Visual Studio!</p>&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-21" class="title">Introducing the Visual Studio editor</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">While Unity can create and store C# scripts, they need to be edited using Visual Studio. A copy of Visual Studio <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>comes pre-packaged with Unity and will open up automatically when you double-click any C# script from inside the editor.</p>&#13;
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-22" class="title">Opening a C# file</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Unity will synchronize with Visual Studio the first time you open a file. The simplest way to do this is by <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>selecting the script from the <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> tab.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Double-click on <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">LearningCurve.cs</code>, which will open up the C# file in Visual Studio:</p>&#13;

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.19: LearningCurve C# script in Visual Studio</p>&#13;

      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">You can change the Visual Studio tabs at any time from <strong class="screenText">Visual Studio</strong> | <strong class="screenText">View</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Layout</strong>. I'll be using the <strong class="screenText">Design</strong> layout for the rest of the book so we can see our project files in the left-hand side of the editor.</p>&#13;
    </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You'll see a folder structure on the left-hand side of the interface that mirrors the one in Unity, which you can <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>access like any other. On the right-hand side is the actual code editor where the magic happens. There are far more features to the Visual Studio application, but this is all we need to get started.</p>&#13;
    <p>&#13;
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">The Visual Studio interface is different for Windows and Mac environments, but the code we'll be <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>using throughout this book will work equally well with both. All the screenshots in this book have been taken in a Mac environment, so if things look different on your computer, there's no need to worry.</p>&#13;
    </p>&#13;
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-23" class="title">Beware of naming mismatches</h3>&#13;
    <p class="normal">One common pitfall that <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>trips up new programmers is file naming—more specifically, naming mismatches—which we can illustrate using line 5 from <em class="italic">Figure 1.19 </em>of the C# file in Visual Studio:</p>&#13;
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">public class LearningCurve : MonoBehaviour&#13;
</code></pre>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">LearningCurve</code> class name is the same as the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">LearningCurve.cs</code> filename. <strong class="keyword">This is an essential requirement</strong>. It's OK if you don't know what a class is quite yet. The important thing to remember is that, in Unity, the filename and the class name need to be the same. If you're using C# outside of Unity, the filename and class name don't have to match.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">When you create a C# script file in Unity, the filename in the <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> tab is already in <strong class="screenText">Edit</strong> mode, ready to <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>be renamed. It's a good habit to rename it then and there. If you rename the script later, the filename and the class name won't match. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you were to rename the file at a later point, the filename would change, but line 5 would be as follows:</p>&#13;
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour&#13;
</code></pre>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you accidentally do this, it's not the end of the world. All you need to do is go into Visual Studio and change <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">NewBehaviourScript</code> to the name of your C# script, as well as the name of the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.meta</code> file on your desktop. You can find the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.meta</code> file in the project folder under <strong class="screenText">Assets </strong>|<strong class="screenText"> Scripts</strong>:</p>&#13;

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.20: Finding the META file</p>&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-24" class="title">Syncing C# files</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">As part of their symbiotic relationship, Unity and Visual Studio communicate with each other to synchronize their <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>content. This means that if you add, delete, or change a script file in one application, the other application will see the changes automatically.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">So, what happens when Murphy's Law, which states that "<em class="italic">anything that can go wrong will go wrong</em>," strikes and syncing just doesn't seem to be working correctly? If you run into this situation, take a deep breath, select the troublesome script in Unity, right-click, and select <strong class="screenText">Refresh</strong>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You now have the basics of script creation under your belt, so it's time we talk about finding and efficiently using helpful resources.</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-25" class="title">Exploring the documentation</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The last topic we'll touch on in this first foray into Unity and C# scripts is documentation. Not sexy, I know, but it's <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>important to form good habits early when dealing with new programming languages or development environments.</p>&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-26" class="title">Accessing Unity's documentation</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Once you start writing scripts in earnest, you'll be using Unity's documentation quite often, so it's beneficial <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>to know how to access it early on. The <em class="italic">Reference Manual</em> will give you an <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>overview of a component or topic, while specific <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>programming examples can be found in the <em class="italic">Scripting Reference</em>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Every game object (an item in the <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong> window) in a scene has a <strong class="screenText">Transform</strong> component that controls its <strong class="screenText">Position</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Rotation</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Scale</strong>. To keep things simple, we'll just look up the camera's <strong class="screenText">Transform</strong> component in the Reference Manual:</p>&#13;
    <ol>&#13;
      <li class="numbered" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong> tab, select the <strong class="screenText">Main Camera</strong> game object</li>&#13;
      <li class="numbered">Move over to the <strong class="screenText">Inspector</strong> tab and click on the information icon (question mark) at the top right of the <strong class="screenText">Transform</strong> component:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17573_01_21.png" alt="" width="750" height="279"/></figure>&#13;
      </li>&#13;
    </ol>&#13;
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.21: Main Camera game object selected in the Inspector</p>&#13;
    <p class="bullet-para">You'll see a web <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>browser open on the <strong class="screenText">Transforms</strong> page of the Reference Manual:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17573_01_22.png" alt="" width="752" height="335"/></figure>&#13;
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.22: Unity Reference Manual</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">All the components in Unity have this feature, so if you ever want to know more about how something works, you know what to do.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">So, we've got the Reference Manual open, but what if we wanted concrete coding examples related to <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>the <strong class="screenText">Transform</strong> component? It's pretty simple—all we need to do is ask the Scripting Reference.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Click on the <strong class="screenText">SWITCH TO SCRIPTING</strong> link underneath the component or class name (<strong class="screenText">Transform</strong>, in this case):</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17573_01_23.png" alt="" width="791" height="320"/></figure>&#13;
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.23: Unity Reference Manual with the SWITCH TO SCRIPTING button highlighted</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">By doing so, the Reference Manual automatically switches to the Scripting Reference:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17573_01_24.png" alt="" width="827" height="488"/></figure>&#13;
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.24: Unity scripting documentation with SWITCH TO MANUAL highlighted</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">As you can see, as <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>well as coding help, there is also an option to switch back to the Reference Manual if necessary.</p>&#13;
    <p>&#13;
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">The Scripting Reference is a large document because it has to be. However, this doesn't mean you <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>have to memorize it or even be familiar with all of its information to start writing scripts. As the name suggests, it's a reference, not a test. </p>&#13;
    </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you find yourself lost in the documentation, or just out of ideas regarding where to look, you can also find solutions within the rich Unity development community in the following places:</p>&#13;
    <ul>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>Forum: <a href="https://forum.unity.com/">https://forum.unity.com/</a></li>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>Answers: <a href="https://answers.unity.com/index.html">https://answers.unity.com/index.html</a></li>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Unity Discord: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/unity">https://discord.com/invite/unity</a></li>&#13;
    </ul>&#13;
    <p class="normal">On the other <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>side of things, you'll need to know where to find resources on any C# question, which we'll cover next.</p>&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-27" class="title">Locating C# resources</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Now that we've got our Unity <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>resources taken care of, let's take a look at some <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>of Microsoft's C# resources. For starters, the Microsoft Learn documentation at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp</a> has a ton of great tutorials, quickstart guides, and <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>how-to articles. You can also find great overviews of individual C# topics at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/index">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/index</a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">However, if you want detailed information on a specific C# language feature, the reference guides are the place to go. These reference guides are an important resource for any C# programmer, but since they aren't always the easiest to navigate, let's take a few minutes to learn how to find what we're looking for.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let's load up the programming guide link and look up the C# <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">String</code> class. Do either of the following:</p>&#13;
    <ul>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Enter <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Strings</code> in the search bar in the top-left corner of the web page</li>&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Scroll down to <strong class="screenText">Language Sections</strong> and click on the <strong class="screenText">Strings </strong>link directly:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17573_01_25.png" alt="" width="751" height="377"/></figure>&#13;
      </li>&#13;
    </ul>&#13;
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.25: Navigating Microsoft's C# reference guide</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You should see <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>something like the following for the class description page:</p>&#13;
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17573_01_26.png" alt="" width="831" height="335"/></figure>&#13;
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.26: Microsoft's Strings (C# Programming Guide) page</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Unlike Unity's documentation, the C# reference and scripting information is all bundled up into one, but its saving grace is the subtopic list on the right-hand side. Use it well! It's extremely important to know where to find help when you're stuck or have a question, so be sure to circle back to this section whenever you hit a roadblock.</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-28" class="title">Summary</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">We covered quite a bit of logistical information in this chapter, so I can understand if you're itching to write some code. Starting new projects, creating folders and scripts, and accessing documentation are topics that are easily forgotten in the excitement of a new adventure. Just remember that this chapter has a lot of resources you might need in the coming pages, so don't be afraid to come back and visit. Thinking like a programmer is a muscle: the more you work it, the stronger it gets.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we'll start laying out the theory, vocabulary, and main concepts you'll need to prime your coding brain. Even though the material is conceptual, we'll still be writing our first lines of code in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">LearningCurve</code> script. Get ready!</p>&#13;
