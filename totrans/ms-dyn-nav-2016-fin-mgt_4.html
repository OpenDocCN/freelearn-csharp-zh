Once data is introduced into the system, you should be able to analyze it.</p><p>Are our departments generating value for the company? Which items or services are the most profitable? What area is experiencing a bigger sales growth? Analysis and reporting can help you to answer these questions.</p><p>In this chapter, we will see the tools available to analyze Dynamics NAV data, both inside and outside the application. This chapter covers the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Dimensions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Filters, charts, and statistics</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Reports</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Account schedules</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Analysis views</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Business Intelligence with Excel and PowerPivot</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec34"/>Understanding dimensions</h1></div></div></div><p>The term dimension is used to describe how analysis occurs. A two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. In a more complex scenario, we could also analyze sales per sales campaign, per customer group, and per area.</p><p>In order to be able to analyze those dimensions you have to make sure that each and every single entry contains the information needed. In Dynamics NAV, a dimension can be seen as information linked to an entry, such as a tag or a characteristic. The purpose of dimensions is to group entries with similar characteristics so that you can report on the data in a way that is meaningful to the company.</p><p>You can define your own dimensions according to how you need to analyze your data. Each dimension can have unlimited dimension values that are subunits of the dimension. For example, a dimension called <code class="literal">Department</code> can have subunits called <code class="literal">Sales, Administration</code>, and so on. These departments are dimension values.</p><p>In Dynamics NAV, you can create unlimited dimensions. However, there are some restrictions on how to access their information. We can group dimensions in three categories, according to their access level (how easy is to access them):</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Global dimensions</strong>: It is very easy to access and filter on them. We can use up to two global dimensions.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Shortcut dimensions</strong>: You need to open a separate page to access them. On some occasions, they are shown on the page's journal and document pages to make it easier to introduce them. We can use up to eight shortcut dimensions. Two of them correspond to global dimensions.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>The rest of the dimensions</strong>: You always need to open a separate page to introduce or see them.</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec50"/>Defining default dimensions on master data</h2></div></div></div><p>Imagine you want to analyze your sales according to the size of your customers. You create a dimension called <strong>CUSTOMERGROUP</strong> and you define different dimension values such as <strong>LARGE</strong>, <strong>MEDIUM</strong>, and <strong>SMALL</strong>.</p><p>One customer might only be a part of one of those groups, so you inform him/her as a default dimension for the customer. You can do this using the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Sales &amp; Marketing</strong> | <strong>Sales</strong> | <strong>Customers</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Select the <code class="literal">01905902</code>, <code class="literal">London Candoxy Storage Campus</code> customer, and click on the Dimensions/Dimensions-single icon on the ribbon bar. The <strong>Default Dimensions</strong> page opens.</li><li class="listitem">Create a new line for the <strong>CUSTOMERGROUP</strong> dimension, as shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_01.jpg" alt="Defining default dimensions on master data"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Now, every time you post a new invoice for the customer or use the customer in documents or journals, the default dimensions defined will be used.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note26"/>Note</h3><p>Default dimensions can be defined in all master data such as customers, vendors, G/L accounts, items, resources, fixed assets, and so on.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec51"/>Using dimensions on documents and journals</h2></div></div></div><p>On some occasions, the default dimensions are not enough and you need to inform about dimensions on single documents or on single journal lines. Let's see it with an example:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Create a new sales invoice for customer <code class="literal">01905902</code>, <code class="literal">London Candoxy Storage Campus</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the Dimensions icon found on the ribbon bar. The <strong>Dimension Set Entries</strong> page opens.</li><li class="listitem">The default dimensions defined for the customer and the salesperson have already been transferred to the document. Create a new line for the <strong>SALESCAMPAIGN</strong> dimension, as shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_02.jpg" alt="Using dimensions on documents and journals"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Once you post the invoice, all the resulting entries will have all four dimensions associated to it.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"/>Note</h3><p>In the example, we have added a new dimension, but you can also delete one of the default dimensions transferred or change its value for this single invoice.</p></div></div><p>In the example, we have set dimension values for the entire document, but it is also possible to set dimension values at the document-line level.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec35"/>Using filters and flowfilters</h1></div></div></div><p>A good and powerful way to view and analyze data is to use filters and flowfilters inside the application. Both of them are used to narrow down the information seen on screen or the information a report produces. Filters can be applied on all pages and on most of the reports. In this section, we will see how to apply filters and flowfilters on pages. In the <em>Using reports</em> section, we will see how to apply them on reports.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec52"/>Applying filters on pages</h2></div></div></div><p>The filtering pane can be found on the upper part of the page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_03.jpg" alt="Applying filters on pages"/></div><p>
</p><p>There is a quick filter section in the upper-right corner where filters can be applied over any of the fields that are shown on-screen. Filters can also be applied over two or more fields at a time, or over fields that are not shown on-screen. To do so, the <strong>Advanced Filter</strong> section should be shown by clicking on the down arrow found at the right of the <strong>Quick Filter</strong> section. A <strong>Show results:</strong> subsection should be shown on-screen, similar to the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_04.jpg" alt="Applying filters on pages"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Advanced Filter</strong> section, you can select any field to filter, and you can also add new filters.</p><p>Imagine that on the item list we want to see all items that have a unit cost <strong>&gt;=100</strong> and whose vendor number is vendor <strong>20000</strong> or vendor <strong>30000</strong>. We can see only those items by applying filters over the <strong>Unit Cost</strong> and the <strong>Vendor No.</strong> fields, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_05.jpg" alt="Applying filters on pages"/></div><p>
</p><p>There are multiple filtering expressions that can be used, including operators (<code class="literal">&gt;</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;</code>, and <code class="literal">=</code>), statements (<code class="literal">|</code> and <code class="literal">&amp;</code>), or intervals, compound expressions, and so on.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note28"/>Note</h3><p>For a complete list of available filtering expressions, refer to the online documentation found at <a class="ulink" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh879066(v=nav.90).aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh879066(v=nav.90).aspx</a>.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec53"/>Applying flowfilters on pages</h2></div></div></div><p>Flowfilters are a special type of filter that isn't used to narrow down results but to narrow down calculations. Some of the information you see in the application is actually a calculation based on other information. For instance, the balance for customers and vendors is actually a calculation based on their ledger entries. So are inventories on items or the balance on general ledger accounts.</p><p>Let's see how to apply a flowfilter on the chart of accounts and the result it produces. We will perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open the chart of accounts by navigating to <strong>Department</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>General Ledger</strong> | <strong>Chart of Accounts</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">On this page, the <strong>Net Change</strong> and <strong>Balance</strong> fields show the sum of general ledger entry amounts for the different accounts.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Chart of Accounts</strong> and select <strong>Limit totals to:</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Add a filter for <strong>Date Filter</strong> and set it as <code class="literal">01/01/16..12/31/16</code>.</li><li class="listitem">The <strong>Net Change</strong> field will be updated. When no flowfilter was applied, both <strong>Net Change</strong> and <strong>Balance</strong> were showing the same amounts. Refer to the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_06.jpg" alt="Applying flowfilters on pages"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Not all flowfilters apply to all flowfields. In the example, we have seen that, after applying a date flowfilter, the <strong>Net Change</strong> field gets updated and shows only the sum of G/L entry amounts of the specified period, while the <strong>Balance</strong> field has remained the same. This is because of the definition of the fields. The definition of the <strong>Net Change</strong> field states that the calculation for this field will take into account a date filter, while the <strong>Balance</strong> field does not.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec54"/>Creating views</h2></div></div></div><p>We have seen how to apply filters and flowfilters on pages. But if we leave the page and open it again later on, the filter is gone. We have to apply the same filter or flowfilter over and over again if we want to see the same results. Wouldn't it be great if we could save the filters so that we could apply them as many times as we wish without having to select again the fields we want to filter and writing the filter expression? That is possible by saving views.</p><p>To save a view, perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Follow the steps mentioned in the previous section to apply filters on the item list page.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Items</strong> and select <strong>Save View As...</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Specify a <strong>Name</strong> for the view and select the <strong>Activity Group</strong> in which you want to save your view, as shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_07.jpg" alt="Creating views"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Every time you want to see your saved view, follow the given steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Home</strong> (or on the <strong>Activity Group</strong> in which you have saved your view).</li><li class="listitem">Click on your saved view.</li></ol></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec36"/>Using reports</h1></div></div></div><p>Dynamics NAV has a bunch of reports that can be used out-of-the-box. Some other reports may have been added by a partner and can also be used.</p><p>Most reports can be found under the Reports and Analysis category on all functional areas. They can also be found in many application pages, where only the reports that are valid for the data shown on the page will be found.</p><p>When running a report, the request page for the report will usually be shown. On the request page, you can usually specify different options. You can apply filters to narrow down the information that will be shown or processed and you can choose whether to preview the report or print it to different devices or applications (use a printer or print to PDF, Excel, or Word).</p><p>In the following screenshot, you can see the request page for the <strong>Customer Top 10 List</strong> report:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_08.jpg" alt="Using reports"/></div><p>
</p><p>Not all the reports have an options section and not all reports allow filters to be applied. Whenever these happen, the corresponding sections will not be shown.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec37"/>Displaying charts</h1></div></div></div><p>Graphical information is always useful when analyzing data. Dynamics NAV offers various ways of viewing data in a graphical way.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec55"/>The show as chart option</h2></div></div></div><p>Whenever the information shown on the screen can be viewed as a chart, on the <strong>Home</strong> tab of the ribbon you will see a section called <strong>View</strong> where users can switch the view of the information from list to chart and vice versa as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_09.jpg" alt="The show as chart option"/></div><p>
</p><p>When you switch to chart view, you can select which fields you want to use as a measure and which ones you want to use as dimensions.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec56"/>Adding charts to the Role Center page</h2></div></div></div><p>Dynamics NAV has a set of predefined charts that can be added to the <strong>Role Center</strong> page. To add a chart to the home page, perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Home</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the Application icon <img src="img/B05733_04_19.jpg" alt="Adding charts to the Role Center page"/>, click on <strong>Customize</strong>, and then click on <strong>Customize This Page</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Select <strong>Chart Part</strong> from the <strong>Available parts</strong> column and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">A <strong>Blank Chart</strong> will appear in the <strong>Role Center layout</strong> column.</li><li class="listitem">Select <strong>Blank Chart</strong> and click on the <strong>Customize Part</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">Select one of the available charts.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>OK</strong> to close the <strong>Customize the Role Center</strong> window</li></ol></div><p>Back on the <strong>Role Center</strong> page, you will see the chosen chart displayed.</p><p>If the predefined generic charts are not enough for you, you can define your own generic charts and make them available to all users. To do so, navigate to <strong>Department</strong> | <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Application Setup</strong> | <strong>RoleTailored Client</strong> | <strong>Generic Charts</strong> and create your chart by specifying the information it should display.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec38"/>Using account schedules</h1></div></div></div><p>The account schedule functionality is part of the <em>Analysis &amp; Reporting</em> section of the <strong>Financial Management</strong> area. It is meant to create customized financial reports based on general ledger information, budget information, or on the analysis views information. Account schedules can group data from various accounts and perform calculations that are not possible directly on the chart of accounts.</p><p>When defining account schedules, the information that will be displayed on both rows and columns can be defined.</p><p>Just to see how it works, we will create a simple account schedule that will compare budgeted amounts versus real amounts. To do so, we perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Reports and Analysis and choose Account Schedules</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>New</strong> to create a new account schedule. For the new account schedule, select <strong>EXAMPLE</strong> as the <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Comparing budget versus reality</strong> as the <strong>Description</strong>, and <strong>ACT/BUD</strong> as the <strong>Default Column Layout</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Account Schedule</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Define the account schedule as shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_10.jpg" alt="Using account schedules"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">The rows in the screenshot mean the following:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The first row gets the net amount of account <code class="literal">69950</code>, a totaling account that summarizes all operating expenses.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">On the second row, a formula sums the results of rows <code class="literal">3</code> and <code class="literal">4</code>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The third row gets the net amount of other expenses from the posting accounts <code class="literal">64300</code> and <code class="literal">67500</code>. As this row is only used for calculation purposes and to show on the report, the <strong>Show</strong> field has been set to <code class="literal">Yes</code>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The fourth row gets the net amount of other expenses from the totaling accounts. The totaling accounts used are <code class="literal">67000</code> and <code class="literal">67600</code>. The <strong>Show</strong> field has been set to <code class="literal">Yes</code>.</li></ul></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>The account schedule is fully defined now. The account schedule defines the rows that will be shown on the report. Columns are defined in the <strong>Column Layout</strong> page. In the example, we have used an existing column layout called <strong>ACT/BUD</strong>. Let's see what the following column layout will show:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">On the <strong>Account Schedule</strong> page where we were defining our account schedule, click on the <strong>Actions</strong> tab and then click on <strong>Edit Colum Layout Setup</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Select <strong>ACT/BUD</strong> for the <strong>Name</strong> field. The <strong>ACT/BUD</strong> column layout definition will be shown. Refer to the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_11.jpg" alt="Using account schedules"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">The column layout defines that the report will have four columns called <strong>Net Change</strong>, <strong>Budget</strong>, <strong>Variance</strong>, and <strong>A-B</strong>:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <strong>Net Change</strong> column will show the net amount for G/L entries</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <strong>Budget</strong> column will show the net amount for budget entries</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <strong>Variance</strong> column will show the difference between the first and the second column</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <strong>A-B</strong> column calculates the percentage that the first column represents versus the second column</li></ul></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Now that we have defined both the account schedule and the column layout, it is time to see the results of our account schedule.</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Reports and Analysis and choose Account Schedules</strong>. Select the one we have just created.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Overview</strong>. The report will be shown on screen, similar to the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_04_12.jpg" alt="Using account schedules"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note29"/>Note</h3><p>The results can be seen in different time periods and filters can be applied over the calculation to get more accurate results. The results can be exported to Excel and can also be printed.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec39"/>Analysis views</h1></div></div></div><p>Analysis views are used to analyze information about dimensions from General Ledger entries, budgets, and cash flow forecast entries. As we have seen, not all dimensions are easily accessed. Analysis views are meant to access all the dimensions in the same easy way, in groups of a maximum of four dimensions at the same time. The four dimension groups may seem a limitation but aren't, since we can create as many analysis views as needed, combining all the dimensions we want.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec57"/>Creating an analysis view</h2></div></div></div><p>Follow the given steps to create an analysis view:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Application Setup</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Dimensions</strong> | <strong>Analysis Views</strong>.

They allow you to analyze the data saved in the system in a manner that is useful to your company. We have learned to analyze data on screen, using filters, flowfilters, and charts. We have also learned about reports, an out of the box way of analyzing data. Account schedules are a tool that helps us analyze data from ledger entries, and so are analysis views. Analysis views are also useful to analyze financial groups by dimensions. Finally, we saw how to link Excel with our Dynamics NAV database to be able to use the Business Intelligence tools included in Excel.</p><p>In the next chapter, we are going to take a look at different predictive tools included in Dynamics NAV, such as budgets or cash flow foretelling.</p></div></body></html>
