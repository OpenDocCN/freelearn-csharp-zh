<p>In this ever growing world of IT, we have numerous different platforms, frameworks, and languages on which applications are built based on the business needs, requirements, and the developer's interest. To remove this barrier of different platforms, Microsoft came up with the fastest, latest, and greatest version of .NET, the .NET Core cross-platform open source framework. Using this framework, beginner-level developers can work on different platforms, and experienced developers and architects can consume their APIs and libraries across different platforms. This book covers simple examples of using .NET Core to&#160;<span>build modern, internet-connected, and cloud-based applications. The book will help us develop simple yet interesting applications to provide the readers with working code examples. We will develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game to begin with, then build a real-time chat application, Lets Chat (for chatting with our online Facebook buddies), a sample chat bot, and a dummy movie booking application.</span></p>

<p><span class="sugar_field">This book is for developers and architects who want to learn how to build cross-platform solutions using Microsoft .NET Core. It is assumed that you have some knowledge of the .NET Framework, OOP, and C# (or a similar programming language). <span>This book is also useful for developers who want to develop a cross-platform application that supports already existing libraries or libraries that they have created on different platforms. The book covers a wide breadth of topics and attempts to explain all the fundamentals needed to build a .NET Core app. The book also introduces you to SignalR Core, Entity Framework Core, containers, F# functional programming, and tips and tricks for developing on .NET Core.</span></span></p>

            <article>
                
<p><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-number"><a href="ch01.html">Chapter 1</a>,<span>&#160;</span></span><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-title"><em>Getting Started</em>,&#160;</span>discusses all the prerequisites required for all the examples in this book, for example, setting up an Ubuntu VM using VirtualBox and through Hyper-V on Windows, and installing .NET Core 2.0 and tools. We will also be introduced to F# and its features in brief, see how F# is different from other object-oriented programming languages, and look at the differences between C# and F#. We will also create a simple sample application using F#, in order to get familiar with the F# syntax.</p>
<p><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-number"><a href="ch02.html">Chapter 2</a>,<span>&#160;</span></span><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-title"><em>Native Libraries in .NET Core</em>,&#160;</span>demonstrates what the ncurses library is and how to extend the console capabilities of .NET Core by implementing the ncurses native library on Linux, and also how to interoperate with existing native and Mono libraries. We will build a sample native library and application that implements this new sample library.</p>
<p><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-number"><a href="ch03.html">Chapter 3</a>,<span>&#160;</span></span><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-title"><em>Building Our First .NET Core Game – Tic-Tac-Toe</em>,&#160;</span>illustrates .NET Core using an example game app, Tic-Tac-Toe. We will be introduced to SignalR Core and learn how it can be used to develop a real-time web application. Instead of using a monochromatic X and O, players can use their images to play the game. With this example game app, we will get an overview of the code (classes, interfaces, models, and so on) and will learn about compiling, building, and testing the application, which applies to .NET Core in general.</p>
<p><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-number"><a href="ch04.html">Chapter 4</a>,<span>&#160;</span></span><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-title"><em>Let's Chat Web Application</em>,&#160;</span>introduces web development with ASP.NET Core. This is done through a simple chat application, Let's Chat, on Windows. We also cover project setup, application architecture and its description, SignalR Core, Dependency Injection, configuration, logging, and more. We will also get familiar with the fundamentals of the features of ASP.NET Core, which are introduced while developing the components of the application.</p>
<p><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-number"><a href="ch05.html">Chapter 5</a>,<span>&#160;</span></span><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-title"><em>Developing the Let's Chat Web Application</em>, d</span>emonstrates numerous examples and code snippets in order to fundamentals and features of ASP.NET Core. By the end of this chapter, the Let's Chat application will be ready for use. We will also get acquainted with testing, hosting, security, and the performance aspects of web development.</p>
<p><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-number"><a href="ch06.html">Chapter 6</a>,<span>&#160;</span></span><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-title"><em>Testing and Deploying – The&#160;Let's Chat Web Application</em>,&#160;</span>explains the .NET Core deployment model. We will deploy the Let's Chat application. We will be introduced to Docker containers. We will also develop and deploy a ASP.NET Core-based chat bot and integrate it with the Let's Chat application.</p>
<p><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-number"><a href="ch07.html">Chapter 7</a>,<span>&#160;</span></span><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-title"><em>To the Cloud</em>,&#160;</span>teaches you what the cloud is and why the modern-day developer should be conversant with cloud technologies. We will get started with Azure, and make ourselves aware of the Azure management portal. We will learn to create a VM from the portal and see that it is automated using PowerShell or other languages using the Azure SDK. We will then manage the VM using PowerShell and see how to start and stop it. We will also learn how to create a web app in Azure from Visual Studio 2017 itself and learn how to publish profiles. Finally, we will have an overview of App Services, and take a quick look at Azure storage.</p>
<p><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-number"><a href="ch08.html">Chapter 8</a>,<span>&#160;</span></span><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-title"><em>Movie Booking Web App</em>,&#160;</span>discusses <strong>Entity Framework</strong> (<strong>EF</strong>) and Entity Framework Core. We will learn about the features of and differences between the two. We will also learn that we should use EF Core only if EF cannot be used or there is a pressing cross-platform requirement to use EF Core. We will learn how to perform CRUD operations using EF Core by creating a simple app. We will then develop a simple movie booking app and learn how to deploy it using Visual Studio. We will also see how we can monitor our web app by enabling Application Insights.</p>
<p><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-number"><a href="ch09.html">Chapter 9</a>,<span>&#160;</span></span><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-title"><em>Microservices with .NET Core</em>, gives&#160;</span>an overview of the microservice architecture and how it is an extension of SOA and overcomes the limitations of traditional monolithic apps. We will learn about the important architectural differences between ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core. We will look at tips to keep in mind while developing ASP.NET Core 2.0 applications, due to the architectural differences. We will then discuss handy information, steps, and tips to improve the performance of ASP.NET Core apps, a few tips on Azure as well, and then a new experimental project of the ASP.NET Core team, which is called Blazor. We'll wrap up the chapter with a discussion on the .NET Core 2.1 roadmap and the features expected in this new version.</p>
<p><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-number"><a href="ch10.html">Chapter 10</a>,<span>&#160;</span></span><span class="cdp-organizer-chapter-title"><em>Functional Programming with F#</em>,&#160;</span>discusses functional programming and its features, such as higher-order functions, purity, lazy evaluation, and currying. We will learn about F# basics, such as classes, <kbd>let</kbd> and <kbd>do</kbd> bindings, generic type parameters, properties in F#, how to write functions and lambda expressions in F#, and exception handling. Also, we'll look at different types of data providers in F# and how different types of data parser work. We will also learn about querying SQL Server vNext with F#.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>By doing this in&#160;</span><kbd>_Layout.cshtml</kbd><span>, we ensure that this functionality is common across all the pages.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre># include&lt;stdio.h&gt;<br/><br/>int hello()<br/>{<br/>  return 15;<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>else<br/>       {<br/>           app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");<br/>       }<br/>       app.UseStaticFiles();<br/>       <strong>app.UseMvc(routes =&gt;</strong><br/><strong>       {</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>mcs -out:helloNative.exe InteropWithNativeSO.cs</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Enter&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Display Name</span>&#160;and&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Contact Email</span>, and click on the&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Create App ID</span>&#160;button.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
