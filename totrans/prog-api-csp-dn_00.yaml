- en: Building a good **Application Program Interface** ( **API** ) is essential for
    creating real-world applications that display data from a data source (most often
    a database). The job of the API, as you’ll see in this book, is the separation
    of concerns on a large scale; specifically separating the concerns of the frontend
    from the backend. This allows you to change one (e.g., swap out a new database)
    without breaking the other (e.g., a website) or vice versa.

- en: A typical enterprise might have multiple teams working on the same overall product.
    For example, you might have a team working on a web presentation of your data,
    another working on the iOS version, and a third working on Android.

- en: On the backend, you might have multiple data sources. In the simple example
    that we use in this book, we examine a car dealership. It might have input from
    sales, but also from inventory, from a service that provides information on average
    prices, and so forth. Some of this is static data easily stored in a database,
    some must be in a frequently updated cache, and some must be obtained on demand.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Coordinating the frontend with the backend is difficult and subject to catastrophic
    breakage should, for example, the format or calculations in the backend change.
    Furthermore, the needs of the presentation level are almost guaranteed to change
    over time. Finally, the frontend is most often not the ideal place to put your
    business logic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: APIs solve these problems. The frontend talks to well-defined endpoints, and
    the backend responds with well-defined data. What the backend does to get and
    manipulate that data is invisible to the frontend. For that matter, the uses that
    the frontend puts that data to are invisible to the backend. Most importantly,
    the API itself doesn’t need to know about either; it just knows what is being
    asked for and how to get it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is targeted at programmers with at least a working knowledge of C#
    who want to create world-class APIs, often for enterprise applications. It assumes
    no prior experience with APIs, though a working acquaintance with SQL will be
    helpful.
