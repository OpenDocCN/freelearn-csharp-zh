Once data is introduced into the system, you should be able to analyze it.</p><p>Are our departments generating value for the company? Which items or services are the most profitable? What area is experiencing a bigger sales growth? Analysis and reporting can help you to answer these questions.</p><p>In this chapter, we will see the tools available to analyze Dynamics NAV data, both inside and outside the application. This chapter covers the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Dimensions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Filters, charts, and statistics</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Reports</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Account schedules</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Analysis views</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Business Intelligence with Excel and PowerPivot</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Understanding dimensions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec34"/>Understanding dimensions</h1></div></div></div><p>The term dimension is used to describe how analysis occurs. A two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be sales per area. In a more complex scenario, we could also analyze sales per sales campaign, per customer group, and per area.</p><p>In order to be able to analyze those dimensions you have to make sure that each and every single entry contains the information needed. In Dynamics NAV, a dimension can be seen as information linked to an entry, such as a tag or a characteristic. The purpose of dimensions is to group entries with similar characteristics so that you can report on the data in a way that is meaningful to the company.</p><p>You can define your own dimensions according to how you need to analyze your data. Each dimension can have unlimited dimension values that are subunits of the dimension. For example, a dimension called <code class="literal">Department</code> can have subunits called <code class="literal">Sales, Administration</code>, and so on. These departments are dimension values.</p><p>In Dynamics NAV, you can create unlimited dimensions. However, there are some restrictions on how to access their information. We can group dimensions in three categories, according to their access level (how easy is to access them):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Global dimensions</strong></span>: It is very easy to access and filter on them. We can use up to two global dimensions.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Shortcut dimensions</strong></span>: You need to open a separate page to access them. On some occasions, they are shown on the page's journal and document pages to make it easier to introduce them. We can use up to eight shortcut dimensions. Two of them correspond to global dimensions.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The rest of the dimensions</strong></span>: You always need to open a separate page to introduce or see them.</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Defining default dimensions on master data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec50"/>Defining default dimensions on master data</h2></div></div></div><p>Imagine you want to analyze your sales according to the size of your customers. You create a dimension called <span class="strong"><strong>CUSTOMERGROUP</strong></span> and you define different dimension values such as <span class="strong"><strong>LARGE</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>MEDIUM</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>SMALL</strong></span>.</p><p>One customer might only be a part of one of those groups, so you inform him/her as a default dimension for the customer. You can do this using the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Departments</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Sales &amp; Marketing</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Sales</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Customers</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Select the <code class="literal">01905902</code>, <code class="literal">London Candoxy Storage Campus</code> customer, and click on the Dimensions/Dimensions-single icon on the ribbon bar. The <span class="strong"><strong>Default Dimensions</strong></span> page opens.</li><li class="listitem">Create a new line for the <span class="strong"><strong>CUSTOMERGROUP</strong></span> dimension, as shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_04_01.jpg" alt="Defining default dimensions on master data"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Now, every time you post a new invoice for the customer or use the customer in documents or journals, the default dimensions defined will be used.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note26"/>Note</h3><p>Default dimensions can be defined in all master data such as customers, vendors, G/L accounts, items, resources, fixed assets, and so on.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Using dimensions on documents and journals"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec51"/>Using dimensions on documents and journals</h2></div></div></div><p>On some occasions, the default dimensions are not enough and you need to inform about dimensions on single documents or on single journal lines. Let's see it with an example:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Create a new sales invoice for customer <code class="literal">01905902</code>, <code class="literal">London Candoxy Storage Campus</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the Dimensions icon found on the ribbon bar.

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_04_02.jpg" alt="Using dimensions on documents and journals"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Once you post the invoice, all the resulting entries will have all four dimensions associated to it.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"/>Note</h3><p>In the example, we have added a new dimension, but you can also delete one of the default dimensions transferred or change its value for this single invoice.</p></div></div><p>In the example, we have set dimension values for the entire document, but it is also possible to set dimension values at the document-line level.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Using filters and flowfilters"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec35"/>Using filters and flowfilters</h1></div></div></div><p>A good and powerful way to view and analyze data is to use filters and flowfilters inside the application. Both of them are used to narrow down the information seen on screen or the information a report produces. Filters can be applied on all pages and on most of the reports. In this section, we will see how to apply filters and flowfilters on pages. In the <span class="emphasis"><em>Using reports</em></span> section, we will see how to apply them on reports.</p><div class="section" title="Applying filters on pages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec52"/>Applying filters on pages</h2></div></div></div><p>The filtering pane can be found on the upper part of the page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_04_03.jpg" alt="Applying filters on pages"/></div><p>
</p><p>There is a quick filter section in the upper-right corner where filters can be applied over any of the fields that are shown on-screen. Filters can also be applied over two or more fields at a time, or over fields that are not shown on-screen. To do so, the <span class="strong"><strong>Advanced Filter</strong></span> section should be shown by clicking on the down arrow found at the right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Quick Filter</strong></span> section. A <span class="strong"><strong>Show results:</strong></span> subsection should be shown on-screen, similar to the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_04_04.jpg" alt="Applying filters on pages"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Advanced Filter</strong></span> section, you can select any field to filter, and you can also add new filters.</p><p>Imagine that on the item list we want to see all items that have a unit cost <span class="strong"><strong>&gt;=100</strong></span> and whose vendor number is vendor <span class="strong"><strong>20000</strong></span> or vendor <span class="strong"><strong>30000</strong></span>. We can see only those items by applying filters over the <span class="strong"><strong>Unit Cost</strong></span> and the <span class="strong"><strong>Vendor No.</strong></span> fields, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_04_05.jpg" alt="Applying filters on pages"/></div><p>
</p><p>There are multiple filtering expressions that can be used, including operators (<code class="literal">&gt;</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;</code>, and <code class="literal">=</code>), statements (<code class="literal">|</code> and <code class="literal">&amp;</code>), or intervals, compound expressions, and so on.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note28"/>Note</h3><p>For a complete list of available filtering expressions, refer to the online documentation found at <a class="ulink" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh879066(v=nav.90).aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh879066(v=nav.90).aspx</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Applying flowfilters on pages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec53"/>Applying flowfilters on pages</h2></div></div></div><p>Flowfilters are a special type of filter that isn't used to narrow down results but to narrow down calculations. Some of the information you see in the application is actually a calculation based on other information. For instance, the balance for customers and vendors is actually a calculation based on their ledger entries. So are inventories on items or the balance on general ledger accounts.</p><p>Let's see how to apply a flowfilter on the chart of accounts and the result it produces. We will perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open the chart of accounts by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Department</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Financial Management</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>General Ledger</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Chart of Accounts</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">On this page, the <span class="strong"><strong>Net Change</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Balance</strong></span> fields show the sum of general ledger entry amounts for the different accounts.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Chart of Accounts</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Limit totals to:</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Add a filter for <span class="strong"><strong>Date Filter</strong></span> and set it as <code class="literal">01/01/16..12/31/16</code>.</li><li class="listitem">The <span class="strong"><strong>Net Change</strong></span> field will be updated. When no flowfilter was applied, both <span class="strong"><strong>Net Change</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Balance</strong></span> were showing the same amounts. Refer to the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_04_06.jpg" alt="Applying flowfilters on pages"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Not all flowfilters apply to all flowfields. In the example, we have seen that, after applying a date flowfilter, the <span class="strong"><strong>Net Change</strong></span> field gets updated and shows only the sum of G/L entry amounts of the specified period, while the <span class="strong"><strong>Balance</strong></span> field has remained the same. This is because of the definition of the fields. The definition of the <span class="strong"><strong>Net Change</strong></span> field states that the calculation for this field will take into account a date filter, while the <span class="strong"><strong>Balance</strong></span> field does not.</p></div><div class="section" title="Creating views"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec54"/>Creating views</h2></div></div></div><p>We have seen how to apply filters and flowfilters on pages. But if we leave the page and open it again later on, the filter is gone. We have to apply the same filter or flowfilter over and over again if we want to see the same results. Wouldn't it be great if we could save the filters so that we could apply them as many times as we wish without having to select again the fields we want to filter and writing the filter expression? That is possible by saving views.</p><p>To save a view, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Follow the steps mentioned in the previous section to apply filters on the item list page.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Items</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>Save View As...</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Specify a <span class="strong"><strong>Name</strong></span> for the view and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Activity Group</strong></span> in which you want to save your view, as shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_04_07.jpg" alt="Creating views"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Every time you want to see your saved view, follow the given steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Home</strong></span> (or on the <span class="strong"><strong>Activity Group</strong></span> in which you have saved your view).</li><li class="listitem">Click on your saved view.</li></ol></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Using reports"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec36"/>Using reports</h1></div></div></div><p>Dynamics NAV has a bunch of reports that can be used out-of-the-box. Some other reports may have been added by a partner and can also be used.</p><p>Most reports can be found under the Reports and Analysis category on all functional areas. They can also be found in many application pages, where only the reports that are valid for the data shown on the page will be found.</p><p>When running a report, the request page for the report will usually be shown. On the request page, you can usually specify different options. You can apply filters to narrow down the information that will be shown or processed and you can choose whether to preview the report or print it to different devices or applications (use a printer or print to PDF, Excel, or Word).</p><p>In the following screenshot, you can see the request page for the <span class="strong"><strong>Customer Top 10 List</strong></span> report:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_04_08.jpg" alt="Using reports"/></div><p>
</p><p>Not all the reports have an options section and not all reports allow filters to be applied. Whenever these happen, the corresponding sections will not be shown.</p></div>

<div class="section" title="Using account schedules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec38"/>Using account schedules</h1></div></div></div><p>The account schedule functionality is part of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Analysis &amp; Reporting</em></span> section of the <span class="strong"><strong>Financial Management</strong></span> area. It is meant to create customized financial reports based on general ledger information, budget information, or on the analysis views information. Account schedules can group data from various accounts and perform calculations that are not possible directly on the chart of accounts.</p><p>When defining account schedules, the information that will be displayed on both rows and columns can be defined.</p><p>Just to see how it works, we will create a simple account schedule that will compare budgeted amounts versus real amounts. To do so, we perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Departments</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Financial Management</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Reports and Analysis and choose Account Schedules</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span> to create a new account schedule.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec41"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we have learned what dimensions are and we have seen that they are a tool for tagging all our ledger entries. They allow you to analyze the data saved in the system in a manner that is useful to your company. We have learned to analyze data on screen, using filters, flowfilters, and charts. We have also learned about reports, an out of the box way of analyzing data. Account schedules are a tool that helps us analyze data from ledger entries, and so are analysis views. Analysis views are also useful to analyze financial groups by dimensions. Finally, we saw how to link Excel with our Dynamics NAV database to be able to use the Business Intelligence tools included in Excel.</p><p>In the next chapter, we are going to take a look at different predictive tools included in Dynamics NAV, such as budgets or cash flow foretelling.</p></div></body></html>
