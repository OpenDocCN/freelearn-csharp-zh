- en: This book is a step-by-step guide to building .NET Standard 2.0 Library and
    its usage in various .NET platforms. Also, we will demonstrate the usage of the
    library using ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, Xamarin iOS, and Xamarin Android.
    Finally, we will guide you through how to package and send your library using
    the NuGet package manager.

- en: This book is for developers who need to get in touch with the new .NET Standard
    2.0 Library. If you have a basic knowledge of C# and what a library can do to
    your code, that's enough to understand this book. Also, if you are a developer
    who writes third-party libraries, this will give you a fair idea of what .NET
    Standard 2.0 Library is and how you can cater to various .NET based platforms
    in Windows, Linux, and macOS using it.
