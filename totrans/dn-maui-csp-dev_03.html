			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>XAML and Fluent C#</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will look at how .NET MAUI applications are created using a markup language for the user interface and C# for all <span class="No-Break">the logic.</span></p>
			<p>.NET MAUI programs are (typically) written in two languages. One is C#, which is used for all the logic, and the other is <strong class="bold">XAML</strong> (pronounced <em class="italic">zamel</em>, to rhyme with camel), which is used for the layout and creation of controls. As you’ll see, the use of XAML is optional. You can create your layout and controls all in C#, but most people don’t. However, that may be changing (more and more of the Microsoft Learn documentation shows <span class="No-Break">both ways).</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">When might you choose to use C#?</p>
			<p class="callout">There are a few reasons to use C# instead of XAML, not least that you know C# and don’t want to bother learning XAML. If you do this, however, you’ll find it difficult to read other people’s code, as most existing <strong class="source-inline">Xamarin.Forms</strong> (the precursor to .NET MAUI) apps are written <span class="No-Break">with XAML.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Using C# can assist in those situations where the design should change based on some condition (such as the type of data you get at runtime). But there are other ways to handle that with XAML as explained in <a href="B19723_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Advanced Topics</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">This book will show C# for some pages, but the focus will be <span class="No-Break">on XAML.</span></p>
			<p>All of the Microsoft documentation is at least in XAML; only some is in C# and some is in Fluent C# (a topic we’ll take up later in this chapter). Nearly all <strong class="bold">Xamarin.Forms</strong> applications and samples use XAML and, for that reason alone, it is worth learning. More important, XAML is a highly expressive declarative markup language that makes creating layouts and controls if not easy, then at <span class="No-Break">least manageable.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter will cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the structure <span class="No-Break">of XAML</span></li>
				<li>Code-behind and <span class="No-Break">event handlers</span></li>
				<li>Exploring the <span class="No-Break">layout options</span></li>
				<li>Creating the UI <span class="No-Break">in C#</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow along with this chapter, you will need <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Visual Studio version 17.5 or later (it’s best to update to the <span class="No-Break">latest version)</span></li>
				<li>The source code covered in this chapter can be found in the GitHub <span class="No-Break">repository: </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/.NET-MAUI-for-C-Sharp-Developers/tree/XAMLAndCSharp"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/.NET-MAUI-for-C-Sharp-Developers/tree/XAMLAndCSharp</span></a></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Understanding the structure of XAML</h1>
			<p>XAML files have the <strong class="source-inline">.xaml</strong> extension, for example, <strong class="source-inline">MainPage.xaml</strong>, in the out-of-the-box program as shown in <a href="B19723_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>. Let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> examine this file to explore XAML for its layout and declaration <span class="No-Break">of controls.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Just an overview</p>
			<p class="callout">This chapter will only scratch the surface of creating XAML layout and controls. <a href="B19723_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a> and <a href="B19723_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a> will cover the details on controls and <span class="No-Break">layouts, respectively.</span></p>
			<p>A .NET MAUI page that is written in XAML will have a name in the format <strong class="source-inline">MyName.xaml</strong>, and associated with that page will be a code-behind page (explained shortly) in the <span class="No-Break">format </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">MyName.xaml.cs</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>At the top of the XAML page is a declaration that this file is, in reality, an XML-type file. That declaration must be at the very top of every <strong class="source-inline">.</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">xaml</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> file.</span></p>
			<p>There are different types of <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>pages (also called views). The most common is <strong class="source-inline">ContentPage</strong>, and here <strong class="source-inline">MainPage</strong> is created as <strong class="source-inline">ContentPage</strong> using <span class="No-Break">this code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/
  dotnet/2021/maui"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
       x:Class="ForgetMeNotDemo.View.MainPage"&gt;</pre>
			<p>As part of the declaration of <strong class="source-inline">ContentPage</strong>, we identify two namespaces (<strong class="source-inline">xmlns</strong>). The first namespace is unnamed and is for .NET MAUI itself. The second namespace, named <strong class="source-inline">x</strong>, is <span class="No-Break">for XAML.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, the class that this XAML file is part of <span class="No-Break">is </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">ForgetMeNotDemo.View.MainPage</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The first part (<strong class="source-inline">ForgetMeNotDemo.View</strong>) is the namespace, and <strong class="source-inline">MainPage</strong> is the name of the class. The <strong class="source-inline">View</strong> part is added to indicate the folder under <span class="No-Break">the project.</span></p>
			<p>Associated with every <strong class="source-inline">.xaml</strong> page is a code-behind page, as mentioned earlier. It is possible to put the logic of your <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>program in the code-behind, which is what we will do for this chapter (in the next chapter, we’ll look at an alternative that is better for testing). In any case, there are a few things that must go in the code-behind, as you’ll see in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>The code-behind file</h2>
			<p>Every XAML file has an associated code-behind page whose name is in the format <strong class="source-inline">&lt;pagename&gt;.xaml.cs</strong>. Thus, the <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>code-behind for this page <span class="No-Break">is </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">MainPage.xaml.cs</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The code-behind file is typically (and correctly) named after the class (that is, the <strong class="source-inline">MainPage</strong> class will be in <strong class="source-inline">MainPage.xaml</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">MainPage.xaml.cs</strong>). The namespace is explicitly declared in the file and should follow the folder structure. Thus, if the namespace is <strong class="source-inline">ForgetMeNotDemo</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">MainPage</strong>, then we’d expect <strong class="source-inline">MainPage.cs</strong> to have the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">ForGetMeNotDemo</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> namespace:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
namespace ForgetMeNotDemo.View;
public partial class MainPage : ContentPage</pre>
			<p>Notice that this is a partial class. In .NET MAUI, all UI classes are marked partial. Notice also that the class indicates that it is <strong class="source-inline">ContentPage</strong>, which is consistent with what we saw in <span class="No-Break">the XAML.</span></p>
			<p>In addition to defining classes, you can use XAML to create the layout of the page, that is, where things go in relation to one another. XAML provides a number of layout options as <span class="No-Break">described next.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Exploring the layout options</h1>
			<p>Returning to <strong class="source-inline">MainPage.xaml</strong>, the first thing we see below <strong class="source-inline">ContentPage</strong> is a <strong class="source-inline">ScrollView</strong> layout element. This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>layout that essentially says that anything contained in <strong class="source-inline">ScrollView</strong> can (<span class="No-Break">surprise!) scroll.</span></p>
			<p>A layout contains other layouts and controls. It does this just as it’s done in XML, which is with opening and closing tags. Here is <span class="No-Break">the syntax:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;ScrollView&gt;
   // … layouts and controls
&lt;/ScrollView&gt;</pre>
			<p>A page can have only one element. Typically, that element is a layout, and since layouts can contain other layouts and controls, an entire hierarchy can <span class="No-Break">be created.</span></p>
			<p>The top four elements in <strong class="source-inline">MainPage.xaml</strong> (out of the box) are <span class="No-Break">as foll<a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>ows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;ScrollView&gt;  [1]
     &lt;VerticalStackLayout  [2]
         Spacing="25"
         Padding="30,0"
         VerticalOptions="Center"&gt;
         &lt;Image [3]
             Source="dotnet_bot.png"
             SemanticProperties.Description="Cute dot net
               bot waving hi to you!"
             HeightRequest="200"
             HorizontalOptions="Center" /&gt;
         &lt;Label [4]
             Text="Hello, World!"
             SemanticProperties.HeadingLevel="Level1"
             FontSize="32"
             HorizontalOptions="Center" /&gt;
&lt;/ScrollView&gt;</pre>
			<p class="callout-heading">Why is this code different from what is in the repo?</p>
			<p class="callout">The preceding code is what you get out of the box. In this chapter, we will enhance this code, and the repo reflects the finished version as of the end of <span class="No-Break">the chapter.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s take this one element at a<a id="_idIndexMarker031"/> time. We’ve already discussed the first element, <strong class="source-inline">ScrollView</strong>, so let’s start with the next, that <span class="No-Break">is, </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">VerticalStackLayout</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>VerticalStackLayout</h2>
			<p>Inside <strong class="source-inline">ScrollView</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">VerticalStackLayout</strong>. As the name implies, this layout holds things stacked one on top <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>of another. Here, we have defined three properties for <strong class="source-inline">VerticalStackLayout</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">Spacing</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Padding</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">VerticalOptions</strong>. Now, <strong class="source-inline">VerticalStackLayout</strong> has dozens of properties and methods. We will learn more about this in <a href="B19723_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter </em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">5</em></span></a><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">, Layouts</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Spacing</strong> determines the amount of<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> vertical space there is between each of the contained elements. Here, <strong class="source-inline">Spacing</strong> is set to <strong class="source-inline">25</strong> <strong class="bold">device-independent units</strong> (<strong class="bold">DIPs</strong>). Using DIPs means that you can define the size for one device (phone, Windows, and so on) and have it look as you intend on all other devices. At least that’s the theory. As a good friend once said, “In theory, theory and practice are the same. But in practice, they <span class="No-Break">never are.”</span></p>
			<p>The second property is <strong class="source-inline">Padding</strong>. This is one of the ways you can control the position and alignment of your controls. The second principal way is with <strong class="source-inline">Margins</strong>. This tells you the distance from the <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>nearest other element (or from the edge of the page), whereas <strong class="source-inline">Padding</strong> tells you the size of the buffer around the current element, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 3</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer021" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.1_B19723.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – Padding and Margin&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – Padding and Margin</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Padding</strong> is written in the format <em class="italic">left</em>, <em class="italic">top</em>, <em class="italic">right</em>, <em class="italic">bottom</em>. A <strong class="source-inline">Padding</strong> value of (<strong class="source-inline">20</strong>,<strong class="source-inline">10</strong>,<strong class="source-inline">5</strong>,<strong class="source-inline">0</strong>) would <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>have a padding on the left of <strong class="source-inline">20</strong> DIPs, <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> on the top, <strong class="source-inline">5</strong> on the right, and no DIPs on the bottom. If the top and bottom are the same, they can be combined. The same is true for the right and left. Thus, as we have here, <strong class="source-inline">Padding = "30,0"</strong>, which means that the left and right will have a padding of <strong class="source-inline">30</strong> but there will be no padding on the top <span class="No-Break">and bottom.</span></p>
			<p>The final property in <strong class="source-inline">VerticalStackLayout</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">VerticalOptions</strong>, which indicates where to place <strong class="source-inline">VerticalStackLayout</strong> with respect to its container (in this case, <strong class="source-inline">ScrollView</strong>). The options for this are based on <span class="No-Break">an enumeration:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Center</em></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">End</em></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Fill</em></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Start</em></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This enumeration is used with a number of different layouts and controls. For now, it is enough to know that <em class="italic">Start</em> means <em class="italic">top</em> for<a id="_idIndexMarker036"/> vertical layouts and <em class="italic">far left</em> for horizontal. Similarly, <em class="italic">End</em> means <em class="italic">far right</em> for horizontal and <em class="italic">bottom</em> for vertical. We’ll return to these values later in <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Image</h2>
			<p>The third element of the<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> page is an <strong class="source-inline">Image</strong> element, which in this case has four properties. The first is the source (where to find the image). The second is called <strong class="source-inline">SemanticProperties.Description</strong>. <strong class="bold">Semantic properties</strong> are added to assist<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> those who use <span class="No-Break">screen readers.</span></p>
			<p>You cannot set the height directly (it is read only), but you can set <strong class="source-inline">HeightRequest</strong>, which we have done here to <strong class="source-inline">200</strong> DIPs. .NET MAUI will try to provide that height depending on your other settings on the page and the available space. Finally, we set <strong class="source-inline">HorizontalOptions</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">Center</strong> so that we center the image on the <span class="No-Break">horizontal axis.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Label</h2>
			<p>Next, we see <strong class="source-inline">Label</strong>. In this case, it too has four properties. The first is the text to display on the label. The <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>second is, again, for screen readers, indicating the organizational structure (here the label is at the top level). The third property is <strong class="source-inline">FontSize</strong>. There are a couple of ways to set <strong class="source-inline">FontSize</strong>, as we’ll see in <a href="B19723_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, but here we are using DIPs. Finally, once again, we set <strong class="source-inline">HorizontalOptions</strong> <span class="No-Break">to </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Center</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>If you scroll down the page, you’ll see there<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> is another <strong class="source-inline">Label</strong> and a <strong class="source-inline">Button</strong> control (which does pretty much what <span class="No-Break">you’d guess).</span></p>
			<p>At the bottom, you will see the close for <strong class="source-inline">VerticalStackLayout</strong>, then the close for <strong class="source-inline">ScrollView</strong>, and finally the close for <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">ContentPage</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> itself.</span></p>
			<p>The XAML thus provides a highly structured approach to describing the layout. Here is the complete <span class="No-Break">XAML page:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encodi<a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>ng="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;ContentPage
    x:Class="ForgetMeNotDemo.MainPage"

    &lt;ScrollView&gt;
        &lt;VerticalStackLayout
            Padding="30,0"
            Spacing="25"
            VerticalOptions="Center"&gt;
            &lt;Image

                SemanticProperties.Hint="Counts the number

                Text="Click me" /&gt;
        &lt;/VerticalStackLayout&gt;
    &lt;/ScrollView&gt;
&lt;/ContentPage&gt;</pre>
			<p>This page opens by declaring <strong class="source-inline">ContentPage</strong> (the most common type of page) and defines the namespace and name of the page (which will be reflected in the code-behind as well). It then declares two standard namespaces (using <strong class="source-inline">xmlns</strong>), the first for .NET MAUI and the second for the <span class="No-Break">XAML markup.</span></p>
			<p>We see <strong class="source-inline">ScrollView</strong>, and<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> inside of that, we see <strong class="source-inline">VerticalStackLayout</strong>, <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>which is set to use padding and spacing and to be centered vertically. We’ll review these properties as we <span class="No-Break">go along.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">VerticalStackout</strong> contains four controls: an image, two labels, and a button. Each of these controls has its own properties. You do not have to be concerned about these properties now; they are explained later. The takeaway here is that layouts can contain layouts and controls. They stack like Ukrainian dolls, one within the other (though controls do not <span class="No-Break">contain controls).</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Notes</p>
			<p class="callout">Each <strong class="source-inline">ContentPage</strong> can have only one layout, but that layout can contain other layouts (as we see here), and so that is not a <span class="No-Break">troublesome problem.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Also, note that due to the size restriction of the printed page, some text will wrap to the <span class="No-Break">next line.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">You can even do this in Visual Studio by going to <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> | <strong class="bold">Options</strong> | <strong class="bold">C#</strong> | <strong class="bold">General</strong> and checking the box for <strong class="bold">Word wrap</strong>. If you do this, I recommend also checking <strong class="bold">Show visual glyphs for word wrap</strong>, which makes reading the code easier. While you are there, you may want to check <strong class="bold">Line numbers</strong>, which can come in very handy, especially when tracking down compile errors. These options are shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 3</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.2</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer022" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2 – Setting Word wrap and Line numbers</p>
			<p>Now, when your line <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>of code is too wide to display, it will wrap and you’ll see <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>a small arrow on the right side indicating that the line has continued, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 3</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.3</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.3 – Visual Studio word wrap</p>
			<p>When something happens such as the user clicking a button, an event is raised. The event is handled in the code-behind, which we’ll <span class="No-Break">review next.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Events versus commands</p>
			<p class="callout">Starting in the next chapter, we <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>will stop working with events and switch to commands. Commands<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> are handled in the ViewModel, which makes them easier to test. For now, for convenience, we’ll handle events and we’ll do so in <span class="No-Break">the code-behind.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Code-behind and event handlers</h2>
			<p>We see in the <strong class="source-inline">Button</strong> control listed <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>next that there is a <strong class="source-inline">Clicked</strong> property that points to a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">OnCounterClicked</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> method:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;Button
  x:Name="CounterBtn"
  Clicked="OnCounterClicked"
  HorizontalOptions="Center"
  SemanticProperties.Hint="Counts the number of times you
    click"
  Text="Click me" /&gt;</pre>
			<p>This method (<strong class="source-inline">onCounterClicked</strong>) is found in the code-behind file, <strong class="source-inline">MainPage.xaml.cs</strong>. All <strong class="bold">event handlers</strong> take two<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> parameters: an object that is the element that raised the event (called the sender), and an object of type <strong class="source-inline">EventArgs</strong> (or a class derived from <strong class="source-inline">EventArgs</strong>). By convention, the <strong class="source-inline">EventArgs</strong> parameter is <span class="No-Break">named </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">e</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span><a id="_idIndexMarker049"/></p>
			<p>In our case (and most cases), we don’t care about the sender and the simple <strong class="source-inline">EventArgs</strong> (as used here) is empty and serves only as a base class for derived classes that provide additional information to the event handler (thus you might have a type derived from <strong class="source-inline">EventArgs</strong> that provides information that the event <span class="No-Break">handler needs):</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private void OnCounterClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    count++;
    if (count == 1)
        CounterBtn.Text = $"Clicked {count} time";
    else
        CounterBtn.Text = $"Clicked {count} times";
    SemanticScreenReader.Announce(CounterBtn.Text);
}</pre>
			<p>The event handler name matches the event handler identified in <span class="No-Break">the XAML.</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;Button
    Clicked="OnCounterClicked"</pre>
			<p>This handler’s job is <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>only to update the text on the button each time the button<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> is clicked. Finally, it uses the <strong class="source-inline">SemanticScreenReader Announce</strong> method to show that text, again for <span class="No-Break">screen</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker052"/></span><span class="No-Break"> readers:</span></p>
			<p>The count instance field is declared at the top of <span class="No-Break">the class:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public partial class MainPage : ContentPage
{
    private int count = 0;
    public MainPage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }</pre>
			<p class="callout-heading">InitializeComponent</p>
			<p class="callout">Notice that the constructor calls <strong class="source-inline">InitializeComponent</strong>. This will be true in the code-behind file of every XAML<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> file. It is the job of <strong class="source-inline">InitializeComponent</strong> to initialize all the elements of <span class="No-Break">the page.</span></p>
			<p>When we get to <a href="B19723_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, you’ll see that we try to minimize the contents of the code-behind file, principally to facilitate the creation of unit tests. At that point, we’ll substitute commands for our <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>events, but let’s hold off on that <span class="No-Break">for now.</span></p>
			<p>While nearly all the<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> Microsoft documentation and all the existing sample code uses XAML for markup, it is possible to create layouts and views in C#. In fact, in recent years, more and more of the Microsoft documentation <span class="No-Break">shows both.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">.NET MAUI Community Toolkit</p>
			<p class="callout">This section requires the .NET MAUI Community<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> Toolkit that you added as a NuGet package in the previous chapter. The Community Toolkit is actually part of a set of toolkits that are open source projects and supplement what is in the release version of .NET MAUI. They are created by community members who work closely with Microsoft developers. It is fair to assume that many of the Community Toolkit features will migrate into .NET MAUI properly over time. I would strongly urge you to use these toolkits, and this book <span class="No-Break">does so.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>If you can do it in XAML, you can do it in C#</h1>
			<p>Anything that can be declared<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> in XAML can be declared in C#. Containment is managed by using the <strong class="source-inline">children</strong> property of an object. Event handlers must be registered on an instance of the control. That is, an event handler would be registered for a particular button, as you’ll see in <span class="No-Break">this example.</span></p>
			<p>Here is the code we wrote in XAML converted <span class="No-Break">to C#:</span></p>

using CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup;    [1]
namespace ForgetMeNotDemo;

  public MainPageCS()

			<p>Let’s quickly take a look at <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>hooking up this new <strong class="source-inline">MainPage</strong>. To test this C# version, set the <strong class="source-inline">ShellContent</strong> element in <strong class="source-inline">AppShell.xaml</strong> to point to your new page <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;ShellContent
    Title="Home"
    ContentTemplate="{DataTemplate local:MainPageCS}"
    Route="MainPageCS" /&gt;</pre>
			<p>Coming back to the XAML converted to C# code, let’s break it down for a better understanding. The numbers refer to the numbers in square brackets in <span class="No-Break">the code:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>We begin by adding a <strong class="source-inline">using</strong> statement for <strong class="source-inline">CommunityToolkit</strong>. We need this for the semantic hints, which are used by screen readers for people with limited or no eyesight. While a finished project should have these for every control, we won’t be using them in this book to save space <span class="No-Break">and confusion.</span></li>
				<li>We want to add a button, and that button will need an event handler (for the click event). In this example, the event handler for the <strong class="source-inline">Clicked</strong> event is at the bottom of the file. To add an event handler to our button, we must first define <strong class="source-inline">Button</strong>. We do this outside of the constructor and we set its <span class="No-Break">properties [</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">2</strong></span><span class="No-Break">].</span></li>
				<li>At the very beginning of the constructor, we assign the event handler method to the <strong class="source-inline">Clicked</strong> event. As noted, that event handler method is at the bottom of the file, though of course it could be (and perhaps should be) in its own <span class="No-Break">file [</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">3</strong></span><span class="No-Break">].</span></li>
				<li>We are now ready to create <strong class="source-inline">VerticalStackLayout</strong> and all the elements contained within the stack <span class="No-Break">layout [</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">4</strong></span><span class="No-Break">].</span></li>
				<li>These elements will be in the stack layout’s <strong class="source-inline">Children</strong> <span class="No-Break">collection [</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">5</strong></span><span class="No-Break">].</span></li>
				<li>Notice that the semantic <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>description is attached to the image using a fluent <span class="No-Break">syntax [</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">6</strong></span><span class="No-Break">].</span></li>
				<li>After all the other elements, we are ready to insert our button into the stack layout’s <strong class="source-inline">Children</strong> <span class="No-Break">collection [</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">7</strong></span><span class="No-Break">].</span></li>
				<li>We’ve put the event handler for the button at the bottom of this file, though you certainly could move it to a different file, probably in a different folder. If you do so, however, remember to add a <strong class="source-inline">using</strong> statement for that <span class="No-Break">namespace [</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">8</strong></span><span class="No-Break">].</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">A note on comments</p>
			<p class="callout">There is a raging controversy in the industry about the use of comments in C# code. I take a rather extreme position: code <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>should be almost completely self-explanatory. That is, if you use appropriate and descriptive names for variables, fields, methods, and so on, no comments should be needed. I’m not a fanatic about this; if the code is sufficiently complex, a comment here and there can be a big help, but comments <em class="italic">rust</em> and should be used sparingly. Thus, you will find few comments in the code, though we will walk through the code in some detail in the paragraphs that follow <span class="No-Break">each listing.</span></p>
			<p>A recent addition to our tool set is the ability to use Fluent C#, which can make your C# code tighter and yet easier <span class="No-Break">to read.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>C# versus Fluent C#</h2>
			<p>In addition to using C# to create your pages, there is a new (as of Winter 2022) <strong class="bold">Community Toolkit</strong> for Fluent C#. This does not change the basic approach but can make creating C# pages cleaner and easier <span class="No-Break">to understand.</span></p>
			<p>To use this, you’ll need to add the <strong class="source-inline">CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup</strong> NuGet package. Refer to the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer024" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.4_B19723.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – Getting the markup package from NuGet&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.4 – Getting the markup package from NuGet</p>
			<p>The project is open source <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>and can be examined (and extended!) at <a href="https://github.com/communitytoolkit/Maui.Markup">https://github.com/communitytoolkit/Maui.Markup</a>. The <strong class="source-inline">ReadMe</strong> file will get you started, though we’ll cover that material in this book <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>The first thing you need to do is to <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>update <strong class="source-inline">MauiProgram.cs</strong> to add the toolkit to the builder using the following <span class="No-Break">code snippet:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
{
    var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
    builder
        .UseMauiApp&lt;App&gt;()
        .UseMauiCommunityToolkit()
        .UseMauiCommunityToolkitMarkup()
        .ConfigureFonts(fonts =&gt;
        {
            fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Regular.ttf", 
                "OpenSansRegular");
            fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Semibold.ttf", 
                "OpenSansSemibold");
        });</pre>
			<p>You can and<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> should chain <strong class="source-inline">UseMauiCommunityToolkitMarkup</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">UseMauiCommunityToolkit</strong> in the <span class="No-Break">builder [</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">1</strong></span><span class="No-Break">].</span></p>
			<p>Now, you can avoid <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/><span class="No-Break">writing this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
var entry = new Entry();
entry.WidthRequest = 400;
entry.HeightRequest = 40;</pre>
			<p>Instead, you can chain all of that together and just <span class="No-Break">write this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
new Entry().Size(200,40);</pre>
			<p>This makes <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>the code <span class="No-Break">much cleaner.</span></p>
			<p>I will provide C# and <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>Fluent C# examples throughout the book; although, as noted, the primary markup language we’ll use <span class="No-Break">is XAML.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we examined the markup language XAML, which is used to create layouts and controls. We saw that anything that can be done in XAML can also be done in C#, and we saw that there are two ways to write that C#: the traditional declarative way and the newer <span class="No-Break">fluent form.</span></p>
			<p>We examined a few important classes (<strong class="source-inline">Button</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Label</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Image</strong>, and so on) and how events can be handled in the code-behind class. I also hinted that code-behind event handlers will be replaced by commands and their implementation in the ViewModel in the <span class="No-Break">next chapter.</span></p>
			<p>In <a href="B19723_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, we’ll dive into the principal architecture for writing apps in .NET MAUI: <strong class="bold">Model-View-ViewModel</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVVM</strong>) and we’ll look at data binding. We’ll then explore a number of cont<a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>rols and how they can <span class="No-Break">work together.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Quiz</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>In a sentence, what <span class="No-Break">is XAML?</span></li>
				<li>What is XAML <span class="No-Break">used for?</span></li>
				<li>What is an alternative to <span class="No-Break">using XAML?</span></li>
				<li>How do we nest one layout inside another <span class="No-Break">using C#?</span></li>
				<li>What is an <span class="No-Break">event handler?</span></li>
				<li>If an event is declared in XAML, where is the <span class="No-Break">event handler?</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Try it out</h1>
			<p>Time to start <span class="No-Break">writing code!</span></p>
			<p>Create a new project named <strong class="source-inline">ForgetMeNotJesse</strong> (you might want to use your own name where I have put mine). Ideally, put that project under source control (see the <em class="italic">Technical requirements</em> section at the top of <span class="No-Break">this chapter).</span></p>
			<p>Use the .NET MAUI template to create your project, using the latest version of .NET (.NET 7 at the time of the writing of <span class="No-Break">this book).</span></p>
			<p>Run your program to make sure everything is set <span class="No-Break">up correctly.</span></p>
			<p>Change <strong class="source-inline">MainPage</strong> so that clicking on the button updates a label below the button with the number of clicks (in addition to displaying it on the <span class="No-Break">button itself).</span></p>
			<p>Once the page is working as intended, create a new page and recreate your <strong class="source-inline">MainPage</strong> in C# rather than in XAML. To test it, remember to set the <strong class="source-inline">ShellContent</strong> element in <strong class="source-inline">AppShell.xaml</strong> to point to your new page <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;ShellContent
    Title="Home"
    ContentTemplate="{DataTemplate local:MainPageCS}"
    Route="MainPageCS" /&gt;</pre>
			<p>If you get stuck at any point, pull down the XAML and C# branch from the book’s repository and compare that solution <span class="No-Break">with yours.</span></p>
