<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Over the last decade, microservices architecture has taken a central role in modern software development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">In this chapter, we will define what microservices architecture is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">You will learn the reasons behind the success of microservices, their pros and cons, and when it is worth adopting them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">Starting with the problems that led to their conception, we will discuss typical scenarios of when to use them, the impact of their adoption on overall project costs, and the returns you might expect.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">You will get insights into the organization of microservices, discovering how it differs from the usual monolithic application by resembling more of an assembly line than user-requests-driven processing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">This newly conceived organization brings with it new challenges that require ad hoc techniques to enforce coherence, coordination, and reliability.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Moreover, new patterns and best practices have been created to tackle challenges with microservices and optimize their advantages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">We will introduce and summarize some fundamental patterns here, while their practical implementation, together with more specific patterns, will be detailed throughout the remainder of the book.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">Before giving a more detailed definition of what a microservices architecture is, we must understand how the idea of microservices evolved and what kind of problems it was called to solve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">We will describe the two main steps of this evolution across two separate subsections.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">The rise of SOA</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">The first step in the direction of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker078"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">microservices was taken by the so-called </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">service-oriented architectures</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">, or </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">SOAs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">, that is, architectures based on networks of communicating processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">Initially, SOAs were implemented as web services similar to the ones you might have already experienced in ASP.NET Core.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">In an SOA, different macro-modules that implement different features or roles in software applications are exposed as separate processes that communicate with each other through standard protocols. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">The first SOA implementation was web services communicating through the XML-based SOAP protocol. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">Then, most web services architectures moved toward JSON-based web APIs, which you might already know about since REST web services are available as standard ASP.NET project templates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.4">The </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Further reading</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1"> section contains useful links that provide more details on REST web services.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">SOAs were conceived during the boom in the creation of software for business applications as one of the ways to integrate the various preexisting applications used by different branches and divisions into a unique company information system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">Since the preexisting applications were implemented with different technologies, and the software expertise available in the various branches and divisions was heterogeneous, SOA was the answer to the following compelling needs:</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">Enabling software communication between modules implemented with different technologies and running on different platforms (Linux + Apache, Linux + NGINX, or Windows + IIS). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">In fact, software based on different technologies is not binary compatible, but it can still cooperate with others if each of them is implemented as a web service that communicates with the others through a technology-independent standard protocol. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Among them, it is worth mentioning the text-based HTTP REST protocol and the binary gRPC protocol. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.4">Worth mentioning also is that the HTTP REST protocol is an actual standard while at the moment, gRPC is just a de facto standard proposed by Google. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.5">The </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Further reading</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1"> section contains useful links for getting more details about these protocols.</span></li>
<li class="numberedList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Enabling the versioning of each macro-module to evolve independently from the others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">For instance, you might decide to move some web service toward the new .NET 9 version to take advantage of new .NET features or new, available libraries, while leaving other web services that donâ€™t need modifications with a previous version, say, .NET 8.</span></li>
<li class="numberedList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Promoting public web services that offer services to other applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">As an example, think of the various public services offered by Google, such as Google Maps, or the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker079"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">artificial intelligence services offered by Microsoft, such as language translation services.</span></li>

<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Toward microservices architectures</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">As application users and traffic increased up to a different order of magnitude, the optimization of performance and the optimal balancing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker080"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1"> of hardware resources among the various software modules became a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">must</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">This led to a new requirement:</span></p>
<div class="note">
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"> Each software module must be scalable independently from the others so that we can allocate to each module the optimal quantity of resources it needs.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">As the company information system gained a central role, its continuous operation, that is, almost zero downtime, became a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">must</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">, leading to another important constraint:</span></p>
<div class="note">
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> Microservices architecture must be redundant. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">Each software module must have several replicas running on different hardware nodes to resist software crashes and hardware failures.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Moreover, to adapt each application to a rapidly evolving market, the requirements on the development times became more compelling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Accordingly, more developers were needed to develop and maintain each application with the given strict milestones.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Unfortunately, handling software projects involving more than around four people to the required quality </span><a id="_idIndexMarker081"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">proved to be substantially impossible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">So, a new constraint was added to SOAs:</span></p>
<div class="note">
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> The services composing an application must be completely independent of each other so that they can be implemented by loosely interacting separate teams.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">However, the maintenance effort also needed to be optimized, yielding another important constraint:</span></p>
<div class="note">
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> Modifications to a service must not propagate to other services. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Accordingly, each service must have a well-defined interface that doesnâ€™t change with software maintenance (or that, at least, rarely changes). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">For the same reason, design choices adopted in the implementation of a service must not constrain any other application service.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">The first and second requirements can be satisfied by implementing each software module as a separate service so that we might allocate more hardware resources to it by simply replicating it in N different instances as needed to optimize the overall performance and ensure redundancy.</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">We also need a new actor, something that decides how many copies of each service to use and on what hardware to place them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">There are similar entities called </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">orchestrators</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">It is worth</span><a id="_idIndexMarker082"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> pointing out that we might also have several orchestrators, each taking care of a subset of the services, or no orchestrator at all!</span></li>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">The first consequence of the independence of microservices design choices is that each microservice must have private </span><a id="_idIndexMarker109"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">storage because a shared database would cause dependencies among the microservices sharing it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">Suppose microservices A and B both access the same database table, T. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.3">Now, weâ€™re modifying microservice A to meet a new userâ€™s requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.4">As part of this update, the solution for A will require us to replace table T with two new tables, T1 and T2.</span></p>

<div class="note">
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1"> Instances of different microservices canâ€™t share a common database.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">Unfortunately, moving away from a single-application database inevitably leads to data duplication and coordination challenges. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">More specifically, the same chunk of data must be duplicated in several microservices, so when it changes, the change must be communicated to all microservices that are using a duplicated copy of it.</span></p>

<div class="note">
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Microservices must be designed in a way that minimizes the duplication of data, or stated differently, duplications should involve as few microservices as possible.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">As has been said in the previous section, if we define microservices according to the domain of expertise, the last constraint should be ensured automatically because different domains of expertise usually share just a little data.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">No other constraints descend immediately from the definition of microservices, but it is enough to add a trivial performance constraint on the response time to force the organization of microservices in a way</span><a id="_idIndexMarker110"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1"> that it more closely resembles an assembly line than a usual user-request-driven software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">Letâ€™s see why.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">We have seen what kind of problems microservices were conceived to solve and how their adoption adds complexity to the application design. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.2">Moreover, it is not difficult to imagine that testing and maintaining an application that runs on several different machines and relies on complex data-driven</span><a id="_idIndexMarker130"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1"> communication patterns should be a complex and time-consuming task.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">Therefore, it is important to assess the impact of using microservices architecture in our application to verify that the cost is affordable and that the advantages of the adoption outweigh the disadvantages and extra costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.2">In the next section, we will cover som</span><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">e criteria for facing this kind of assessment.</span></p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">When is it worth adopting microservices architectures?</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">An application that requires </span><a id="_idIndexMarker131"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">more than five developers is certainly a good target for a microservices architecture since logical microservices help split the workforce into small, loosely coupled teams.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">A high-traffic application with several time-consuming modules is also a good target for microservices architecture since it needs module-level performance optimizations.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">Low-traffic applications that require just a small team of less than five people for their implementation are not a good target for a microservices architecture.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">Deciding when to adopt microservices in all other situations that fall between the above extreme cases is not easy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.2">In general, it requires a detailed analysis of costs and returns.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">Considering costs, using a microservices architecture requires a development effort of about five times that of a usual monolithic application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.2">We got this scale as an average on 7 total rewrites of monolithic applications with a Microservices architecture.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">This is in part due to the extra effort needed to handle reliable communications, coordination, and detailed resource management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.2">However, most of the costs come from the difficulties of testing, debugging, and monitoring a distributed application.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">Later in the book, we will describe tools and methodologies for efficaciously handling all of the above problems, but the extra cost brought on by microservices remains.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">Considering expected returns, the most significant advantage is the capability of focusing maintenance on just the critical modules, since if the interface of a microservice doesnâ€™t change also the more drastic changes in its implementation, such as moving to a different operating system, or to a different development stack, or simply to a newer version of the same stack, will not require any change to all other Microservices.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">We may decide to reduce the maintenance of modules that do not require several market-critique changes to a minimum while focusing on just the market-critique modules that either increase the perceived value of the application or require changes to adapt them to a quickly evolving market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.2">To summarize, we may focus on just the important changes required by the users, leaving all modules that are not involved in these changes unchanged.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">Focusing on just a few modules ensures a low time to market, so we can satisfy market opportunities as soon as they appear without the risk of releasing a new version too late.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">We are also able to fine-tune performance quickly when the traffic on some specific functionalities increases by scaling just the involved microservices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.2">It is worth pointing out that the capability of fine-tuning each specific building block of our application allows for better usage of the available hardware, thus reducing the overall hardware costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.3">Moreover, the ability to fine-tune and monitor </span><a id="_idIndexMarker132"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">specific microservices simplifies achieving better response times and, in general, performance goals.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">Having analyzed the evolution that led to the microservices architecture, as well as its very nature and basic organization, we can move on to patterns that, while not specific to microservices, are common in microservices architectures.</span></p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">Microservices common patterns</span></h1>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">In this section, we will analyze the fundamental patterns used in all microservices architectures whose description is not tied to a specific </span><a id="_idIndexMarker133"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">programming language or tool. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.2">Most of them concern microservice communication. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.3">Letâ€™s start with common retry strategies.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">Resilient task execution</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">Microservices can be moved from one machine to another to achieve better load balancing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.2">They can also be restarted to reset some possible memory leaks or to solve other performance issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.3">During these operations, they may</span><a id="_idIndexMarker134"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1"> miss some messages sent to them, or they may abort some ongoing computation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.2">Moreover, failure due to software bugs or hardware faults may occur, too.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">Since microservices architectures are required to be reliable (almost zero downtime), they are usually redundant, and particular care is needed to detect faults and apply corrective actions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.2">Therefore, all microservices architectures must provide mechanisms to both detect failures, such as simple timeouts, and correct failed operations.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">Failures are detected through the detection of either unexpected exceptions or timeouts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.2">Since the code can always be arranged in a way to turn timeouts into exceptions, failure detection can always be reduced to adequate exception handling.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">To resolve this problem, the community of microservices developers defined useful </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">retry policies</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1"> one can attach to specific exceptions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.2">They are usually implemented through specific libraries together with other reliability patterns, but sometimes they are offered out of the box by cloud providers.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">Below are the standard reliability patterns used in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker135"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">microservices architectures:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">Exponentials retry</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">: It has been designed to overcome temporary faults, such as a failure due to a microservice instance restart. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.2">After each failure, the operation is retried with a delay that increases exponentially with the number of attempts, until a maximum number of attempts is reached. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.3">For instance, first, we would retry after 10 milliseconds, and if this retry operation results in a new failure, a new attempt is made after 20 milliseconds, then after 40 milliseconds, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.4">If the maximum number of attempts is reached, an exception is thrown, where it can find another retry policy or some other exception-handling strategy.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">Circuit break</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">: It has been designed to handle long-term failures and it is usually triggered after an exponential retry reaches its maximum number of retries. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.2">When a long-term failure is assumed, access to the resource is interdicted for a fixed amount of time by returning an immediate exception without attempting all the required operations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.3">The interdiction time must be sufficient to allow human intervention or any other kind of manual fix.</span></li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">Bulkhead isolation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">: Bulkhead isolation has been designed to prevent failure and congestion propagation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.2">The basic idea is to organize services and/or resources into isolated partitions so that failures or congestions originating in a partition remain confined to that partition, and the remainder of the system continues working properly.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal-one"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1">Suppose, for instance, that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker136"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">several microservice replicas use the same database (as is common). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.2">Due to a failure, a replica might start opening too many database connections, thus also congesting all other replicas that need to access the same database.</span></p>
<p class="normal-one"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">In this case, we recognize that database connections are critical resources that need bulkhead isolation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.2">Thus, we compute the maximum number of connections the database can properly handle and partition them among all replicas, assigning, for instance, a maximum of five simultaneous connections to each microservice replica.</span></p>
<p class="normal-one"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">This way, a failure in a replica doesnâ€™t affect the proper access of other replicas to the database. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.2">Moreover, if the application is properly organized, requests that fail to be served because of the failed replica will eventually be retried on a properly working replica so that the overall application can continue working properly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.3">In general, if we would like to partition all requests to a shared resource, we can proceed as follows:</span></p>
<ol class="numberedList level-2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li class="numberedList level-2" value="1"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">Only a maximum number of similar pending simultaneous outbound requests to the shared resource is allowed; letâ€™s say 5, as in the previous database example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.2">This is like putting an upper bound on thread creation.</span></li>
<li class="numberedList level-2"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">Requests exceeding the previous bound are queued.</span></li>
<li class="numberedList level-2"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">If a maximum queue length is reached, any further requests result in exceptions being thrown to abort them.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">It is worth pointing out that the requests partitioning and throttling pattern previously shown is a common way of applying bulkhead isolation, but it is not the only way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.2">Any partition plus isolation strategy can be classified as bulkhead isolation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.3">For instance, one might split the replicas of two interacting microservices into two isolated partitions such that only replicas belonging to the same partition might interact. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.4">This way, a failure in a partition canâ€™t affect the other partition.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">Together with the actions and strategies for handling failures exposed above, microservices architectures also offer failure prevention strategies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.2">Failure prevention is achieved by monitoring anomalous consumptions of hardware resources and performing periodic hardware and software health checks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.3">For this purpose, orchestrators monitor the usage of memory and CPU resources and restart a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker137"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">microservice instance or add a new instance when they fall out of a developer-defined range. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.2">Moreover, they offer the possibility of declaring periodic software checks that the orchestrator can perform to verify if the microservice is working properly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.3">The most common of such health checks is a call to a </span><strong class="keyWord"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">health REST endpoint</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1"> exposed </span><a id="_idIndexMarker138"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">by the microservice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.2">Again, if the microservice fails a health check, it is restarted.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">When a hardware node fails a health check, all of its microservices are moved to a different hardware node.</span></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1">Efficacious handling of asynchronous communication</span></h2>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">Asynchronous communication with </span><a id="_idIndexMarker139"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">associated asynchronous acknowledgment causes three important problems:</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">Since after the communication the sending microservice moves to serving other requests without waiting for the acknowledgment, it must keep a copy of all messages it sent until an acknowledgment or a communication failure, such as a timeout, is detected, so that it can retry the operation (with an exponential retry, for instance), or it can take another kind of corrective action.</span></li>
<li class="numberedList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">Since in case of a timeout a message may be re-sent, the intended recipient can receive several copies of the same message.</span></li>
<li class="numberedList"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">Messages can reach a recipient in an order that is different from the one they were sent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.2">For instance, if two messages that instruct the recipient to modify the name of a product are sent in the order M1, M2, we expect the final name to be the one contained in M2. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.3">However, if the recipient receives the two messages in the wrong order, M2, M1, the final product name will be the one contained in M1, thus causing an error.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">The first problem is handled by keeping all messages in a queue, as shown in the following figure:</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.1">In this chapter, we described the basics of microservices, starting from their evolution and continuing on to their definition, organization, and main patterns.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.493.1">We described the main features and requirements of a microservices-based application, how its organization resembles more of an assembly line than a user-requests-driven application, how to make microservices reliable, and how to handle efficaciously both failures and all problems caused by efficient asynchronous communication.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.1">Finally, we described how to make all microservices more independent from each other with publisher-subscriber-based communication and how to interface a microservices application with the external word.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.1">The next chapter describes two important building blocks for building enterprise-level microservices: Docker and Onion architectures.</span></p>

<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.1">What is the main difference between a hold-style SOA and a modern microservices architecture?</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="normal-one"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.1">In Microservices architectures are fine-grained. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.2">Moreover, each Microservices must not depend on the design choices of other Microservices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.3">Furthermore, microservices must be redundant, replicable, and resilient.</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">Why are loosely coupled teams so important?</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="normal-one"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">Because it is quite easy to coordinate loosely coupled teams.</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1">Why must each logical microservice have dedicated storage?</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="normal-one"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">This is an immediate consequence of the independence of the design choices of a Microservice from the design choices adopted in all other Microservices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.2">In fact, sharing a common database would force common design choices on the database structure.</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1">Why is data-driven communication needed?</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="normal-one"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1">This is the only way to avoid long chains of recursive request and answers that would cause unacceptable overall response times.</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.1">Why is event-driven communication so important?</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="normal-one"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">Because event-driven communication completely decouples Microservices, so that developers can add a new Microservice without modifying any of the preexisting Microservices.</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="6"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1">Do API gateways usually offer login services?</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="normal-one"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1">No login services are offered by specific Microservices called Authentication Servers.</span></p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="7"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1">What is exponential retry?</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="normal-one"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">A retry policy that exponentially increases the delay between failures and retries after each failure.</span></p>
