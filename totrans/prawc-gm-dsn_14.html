Based on what we've just said, it should have been called <span class="italic">The Final 80%</span>. But that wouldn't really help with the point we're trying to make here.</p><p class="calibre_2">The problem with the so-called <span class="bold">final 10%</span> is that it often takes much longer than the final 10% of budgeted development time. When the game finally comes together, not only will bugs and technical problems with the software inevitably emerge, but some of the systems might prove to be not working as expected. Some design flaws might lie hidden in the game and become evident only at this stage.</p><p class="calibre_2">This is the reason why so many games' release dates are delayed and so many budgets are burned before the project is done. This is why the dreaded crunch time practice exists in our industry.</p><p class="calibre_2">It is also the reason why so many games projects fail:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00086.jpg" class="calibre_101"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">The </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Wrap-Up</span></span><span class="calibre4">, </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Test</span></span><span class="calibre4"> and </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Polishing phase</span></span><span class="calibre4"> usually takes much longer than what was originally planned, causing great delays in the final release. The purpose of this diagram is to give you an idea of what could go wrong in the game development process</span></p><p class="calibre_2">In this chapter, we are going to discuss the activities and issues that make that final 10% so challenging, focusing on those that put the game designer at the center of the action.</p><p class="calibre_2">This is not a book for project managers or producers (although they would certainly benefit from some game design knowledge), therefore this chapter won't be focused around how to avoid crunch time or meet deadlines.<br class="calibre1"/> This chapter is about the activities that must be done in that last 10%. As a designer is your duty to know them and enter the final stage of production confident and ready for the final push before release!</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">It is important to keep in mind that, in the real world, no project schedule contemplates assigning 80% of the time available to just the final part.

We don't live in an ideal world, so be prepared to confront the final 10% with no more than just 10% of the time...or less!</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Usually, the final stage of the production begins with the Alpha release. Here follows a list of the activities commonly associated with this final stage:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ol class="calibre_110"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Putting the pieces together</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Polishing</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Quality Assurance</li></ol><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_855"/>


<div id="filepos980495" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Putting the pieces together</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">It's very unlikely that a game would take its final shape by linearly expanding from its <span class="italic">narrative beginning</span> to its ultimate ending. During the development, some pieces of the game are developed as modules and all these modules are put together when a playable of some sort is required. But maybe after the Alpha is out, some extra iteration is required to sort out problems and those pieces need to be re-shuffled for the Beta or the next version. Again, it is possible that this task would come at the last moment.</p><p class="calibre_2">Depending on the size of the project, the designer might have a big responsibility in putting everything together. Usually, the designers are in charge of setting up the whole game content. Maybe the beta version included only a single level or mission, and that one was put together as best as possible for the Beta phase. Now it is time to create and introduce the rest of those missions, quest, dialogs, characters, and levels.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_857"/>


<div id="filepos981706" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Feature creep</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Once the game is finished, or almost finished, it's really easy to see what might be missing. The team, with a clearer picture of a semi-finished product, might come up with fresh new ideas, different solutions, or new content. The feeling is that, with these kinds of additions, it would be a much better game. And you and the team are almost there if only there was a bit more time. Or maybe, while putting the pieces together, it starts to feel like it is not enough. It is not as fun as you thought it would be.</p><p class="calibre_2">This is the moment where a project might face a dangerous problem: feature creep, the constant addition of features and functionality to a product. Instead of putting together what's already been developed in the best way possible and focusing on increasing its quality, the team makes the collective mistake to think that more new features would make a better game.</p><p class="calibre_2">An interesting example of deliberate feature creep is the practice of promising stretch goals that we have seen in recent years on <span class="italic">Kickstarter</span>. <span class="italic">Kickstarter</span> is a crowd-funding platform where creators can pitch their projects directly to the final user, and ask them for money to make those projects come to life. The idea behind stretch-goals is to promise users more stuff upon reaching extra funding goals after the initial goal is achieved.</p><p class="calibre_2">So, an original idea is pitched, people love it and back it with their money. The funding goal is achieved and now the developers start adding (promise to add) features to an original design that was already great. There is a great opportunity to make a bigger and better game (and also to raise more money)...but there's also a huge risk of drifting away from the original idea by adding the unnecessary. Of course, the good news for these Kickstarter projects is that feature creep in the design and concept phase of a project is not as bad as coming up with new things when a game is almost completed.</p><p class="calibre_2">A classic real-life example is adding a multiplayer mode to a single player game. Many game development teams have been almost destroyed by a sudden change in the original plans. To make the game more appealing, a multiplayer mode is announced. Maybe during a big conference or convention. The game is almost finished, and the multiplayer feature is used to increase the hype or attract further investments. Or maybe the team itself think that, now that the game is completed, a multiplayer mode can really be the icing on the cake. When something like this happens and it wasn't planned since the beginning, only bad things can happen.</p><p class="calibre_2">What a game designer can do to avoid this danger is to find what can be cut, instead of adding more: <span class="italic">Less is more</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">We already discussed this when we spoke about the initial design of a game, now we're going to use it again in the final stage.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_859"/>


<div id="filepos985000" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Less is more</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">You should always be on the lookout for features that could be cut from your game. There are three main properties you can look for in features that might make them good candidates for removal from a game:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Unintuitive mechanics</span>: Unintuitive mechanics are always a warning. If players struggle to understand why or how a mechanic works, it might be a good idea to remove it altogether or to strip it down to a much simpler version.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Mechanics that don't really appeal to the audience:</span> Mechanics that don't appeal your audience are a common mistake. A complex crafting system in a casual match-3 game might not be a great idea. Make sure that every mechanic will reinforce and support your design pillars.<br class="calibre1"/></li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Unnecessary features:</span> What might have sounded like a great idea on paper may turn out to be unnecessarily complex in the final game. Maybe you designed multiple different upgrade paths for the character and, during playtesting, some of them simply turned out to be not meaningful enough to be engaging and compelling. <br class="calibre1"/></li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_861"/>


<div id="filepos986432" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Polish</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">What is polish?</p><p class="calibre_2">This is another concept that many developers have tried to nail with a formal definition. As you know by now, we don't like formal definitions, so be warned that the notion of what polish is might vary from developer to developer, but most importantly from game to game! To polish a game, basically, means to raise the standard of its quality.</p><p class="calibre_2">Why and how would you polish a pair of shoes or a plank of wood?</p><p class="calibre_2">You don't change the shoes or the shape of the plank. Polishing a pair of walking boots won’t turn them into a pair of patent leather formal shoes to go with your tuxedo. The goal of polishing is to smoothen the game and the experience. To tweak its values and refine its details until it really feels great and immediately pleasing on an aesthetic and gameplay level.</p><p class="calibre_2">The (in)famous scenario where the game designer finally plays the Alpha of the game and comes up with a brilliant idea to make things even better...usually is not polishing. It is the dreaded <span class="italic">wouldn't be cool to add this?</span> scenario. Polishing should not be about adding anything. If a feature is finished or supposed to be finished, and the team feels the necessity to add something on top of it to make it really work, that's a sign that the feature might be broken at its core.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_863"/>


<div id="filepos988081" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">How to polish</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Polishing a game is not a game design job only. Actually, most of the polishing work would be carried out by artists, animators, and programmers. The game designer has a crucial role in this phase nonetheless. Entering the final stage of a game production means that the game designer will have to put himself in the shoes of the player and play the game like it is his favorite game of all time. This is the stage where the game designer has to become an expert gamer of their own game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Most gamers would probably be surprised how little playing of the game happens by most people in game development. Most programmers and artists usually ship games that they have never actually played the whole way through, except those particular moments or scenes here and there where their work was focused.</p><p class="calibre_2">That’s perfectly fine for them, but unacceptable for game designers.</p><p class="calibre_2">Game designers, along with game directors and the QA department, are the ones that have to keep engineers and artists informed of the final product's quality and determine which areas are in critical need of polish or further attention.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let’s have a look at the most common tasks for polishing a game:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Stability and performance</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Audio and visual</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Design polish</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">In the following paragraphs, we're going to briefly mention technical tasks and focus more on the tasks specific to the game designer.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_865"/>


<div id="filepos990038" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Stability and performance</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Stability and performance are the first two things to be looked at during polishing. It involves many procedures and techniques that might keep the engineers busy for a while, but the designers can spot moments or parts of the game that runs a bit too slow or have glitches. Polishing stability and performance means avoiding crashes, glitches, improving and stabilizing the <span class="bold">FPS</span> (<span class="bold">frames per second</span>), and reducing the functional bugs (even the smallest ones) to zero or as close to zero as possible. It also includes monitoring and optimizing the use of CPU and GPU and the memory usage.</p><p class="calibre_2">It is worth noting that, even if this sounds like a very technical activity for engineers, sometimes it could take only a designer to solve a performance issue. If a designer has requested features that are within the limits of what can be technically achieved, then the design might have to be reworked, numbers scaled back, the number of enemies reduced, attacks per second changed, visual effects tuned down, or the limits on the number of players in a multiplayer game might have to be enforced.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">One way designers can definitely help the engineers solve performance issue is by offering solutions like the above. While an engineer might happily/frustratedly bang their head against a wall of code for a week trying to squeeze another 5% of performance out of a tight section of code, perhaps a simpler solution could be just a designer lowering a number to relieve some strain on the engine. It's worth being vigilant as a designer and involved in knowing the performance bottlenecks of the engines you are most likely making content for; you can save the engineering team potentially days of time and help get the game shipped in time.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_867"/>


<div id="filepos992162" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Perceived performance</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Perceived performance is as important as actual performance. We are talking here about a few minor tweaks that can help give the impression of overall better performance to players. Lowering the max FPS is another common trick, a game capped at 30 FPS might look more fluid than a game that struggles to maintain consistently 60 FPS.</p><p class="calibre_2">Another common way to improve perceived performance is to enhance the player experience during loading screens.</p><p class="calibre_2">Loading screens are obviously one of the most obvious and direct feedbacks of a game technical's performance. The bigger the game, the better the graphics, the longer the loading times. Same with online multiplayer games: finding matches or connecting to servers might take a while - even worse, it might all depend from the player's internet connection, and there's very little the engineers can do about that.</p><p class="calibre_2">During waiting times, there is a multitude of ways to give the player the impression that the game experience is not <span class="italic">blocked</span> by the loading screen: tips, the game's lore, and tutorials are extremely common, giving the player something to read while waiting.</p><p class="calibre_2">Some games even feature a mini-game during the loading times, such as <span class="italic">The Sims 3</span>'s hidden object mini-game.</p><p class="calibre_2">The art of interactive loading screens reached new heights with titles such as <span class="italic">Bayonetta</span> or <span class="italic">Fifa,</span> where the player is able to practice with the mechanics of the game:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00164.jpg" class="calibre_102"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">The tutorial feature during loading screens was so great in </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Bayonetta</span></span><span class="calibre4"> that many players started requesting online whether there was a way to stay on the loading screen and keep practicing!</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_869"/>


<div id="filepos994432" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Audio and visual</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Audio and visual factors are very important in terms of polishing. Stability and performance remain the top priority, as a fantastic game that crashes or freezes is always worse than a mediocre game that always runs smoothly. Nonetheless, audio and visual are the player-facing layer and every polishing effort will have a tremendous impact on the player experience and enjoyment of the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">The list of improvements and polishing that can be done with audio, animations, colors, environments, and character design is huge, but we can summarize it in one simple word—<span class="bold">details</span>. The attention to detail, especially in audio, environments, and animations is what usually takes a game to the next level of quality.</p><p class="calibre_2">To have an idea of how a polished game looks like, just think about any of the latest <span class="italic">Zelda</span> or <span class="italic">Mario</span> games. The graphics, sound effects, animations, response to every player input...they are as great as they can be. It's a pleasure not only to play them but just watching them. Or compare the latest <span class="italic">Call of Duty</span> to a lower budget indie FPS such as <span class="italic">Insurgency</span> (far be it from any judgment of the latter, we're comparing two games with a very different budget and audiences here, and that's exactly why the polishing gap is so big).</p><p class="calibre_2">Another great way to get an idea of how polishing looks like is to compare the various stages of a game, such as alpha, beta, and release:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00020.jpg" class="calibre_103"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Pay attention to details such as lighting, particle effects, the lava texture, the user interface on the bottom right part of the screen, and the UI elements for the trigger and the indicator in the upper part of the screen</span></p><p class="calibre_2">On mobiles, companies such as <span class="italic">Supercell</span> or <span class="italic">Zynga</span> are famous for delivering games with an incredible level of polishing, which is undoubtedly one of the reasons for their success. Polished games are more captivating; just by looking better, they give the feeling to players that the game experience and gameplay are going to be just as smooth as the visual. Beware though, technical and visual polish might be enough to get players to try the game out, but if the design and the gameplay don't live up to the expectations, I doubt any player is going to stick around!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_871"/>


<div id="filepos997218" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Design polish</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Design polish includes a huge variety of activities. Every aspect of the game over which the game designer has direct control can be tweaked and polished. Most likely, we're talking about balancing, especially difficult.</p><p class="calibre_2">Once the designer finally has the chance to play the game in its entirety, it is possible to go fine-tune values that might have been pre-determined only by data and numeric models. We have seen in the chapter about balancing how a game system is also made of numbers. This is the time to put them to test and tweak them to perfection.</p><p class="calibre_2">The more time designers have to work and fine-tune all these values, the smoother the player's final experience will be. This is definitely something to think about during planning.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_873"/>


<div id="filepos998243" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Play</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Obviously, the first step in polishing the design of a game is to play it. The designers need to sit down with as many people as possible and play the game with them. We've said this already; this is the moment when the designer becomes the most passionate player of their own game.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">This phase might be neglected by the team. Maybe everyone is exhausted at this point and the idea of playing hours of a game you've been working on for months or even years is daunting. Keep up your team morale! Make the playing activity fun for the team and for yourself. Organize tournaments or challenge with the game and learn from what you see!</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_875"/>


<div id="filepos999193" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Talk</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Talk to the team or anyone might be playing the game. Compare different points of view, and note down what doesn't really work or what you feel might be swiftly improved. Take on every criticism and do your best to make every adjustment you can.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">There are designers who are very good at taking criticism and some that are not comfortable with it. It's vital to remain open-minded. If you close down and get defensive, you risk losing a channel of feedback as your colleagues don't want to hurt your feelings. Be thankful of all feedback you receive- even if it hurts, try not to show it, because then you will be open to more opinions and the chance to make the game better for all.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">Make a checklist of all these little things and then take a significant amount of your daily time to work on improving them, one by one. For bigger games, a producer might help you in this task, organizing and prioritizing each activity.</p><p class="calibre_2">Show the game to people that have never seen it before and listen carefully to their opinions. Some obvious problems might be invisible to you or others from the team. When you work on a game for a long time, it's very easy to miss those.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Exercise</span></span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> Consider a game that you like and you think has been somehow polished:</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> - Identify at least three features that have been visually polished to make the game “feel” better, without having any impact on its core gameplay.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> - Do the same, but focusing on design polish, compare similar mechanics for different games and focus on how some of them are more polished than the others.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"> - Can you spot some technical polishing?

<div id="filepos1001538" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Quality assurance</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">There are different methods for game testing, and most methodologies are developed by individual video game developers and publishers. Methodologies are continuously refined and may differ for different types of games (for example, the methodology for testing an MMORPG will be different from testing a casual game). Many methods are borrowed directly from general software testing techniques. Outlined below are the most important methodologies for video games:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Functionality testing</span>: Most commonly associated with the phrase <span class="italic">game testing</span>, as it entails playing the game in some form. Functionality testing does not require extensive technical knowledge. Functionality testers look for general problems within the game itself or its User Interfaces, such as stability issues, game mechanic issues, and game asset integrity.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Compliance testing</span>: First-party licensors for console platforms have strict technical requirements for titles licensed for their platforms. For example, Sony publishes a <span class="bold">Technical Requirements Checklist</span> (<span class="bold">TRC</span>), Microsoft publishes <span class="bold">Xbox Requirements</span> (<span class="bold">XR</span>), and Nintendo publishes a set of <span class="italic">guidelines</span> (Lotcheck)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Compatibility testing</span>: Compatibility testing teams test the major functionality of the game on various configurations of hardware. This is mostly done for PC or mobile games, as console platforms are more standardized.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Localization testing</span>: Ensures the accuracy and quality of game's localization.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Soak testing</span>: Involves leaving the game running for prolonged periods time in various modes of operation, such as idling, paused, or at the title screen.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Regression testing</span>: QA checks to see whether the bug is still there (regression) and then runs similar tests to see whether the fix broke something else.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">All these testings are done following a test plan. A test plan documents the strategy that will be used to verify and ensure that a game or feature meets its design specifications. It tells the tester what to test and look for in every piece of the game.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_879"/>


<div id="filepos1004165" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Game designers and QA</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The relationship between a game designer and QA is very important. Game documentation might (and will) be used by QA as a reference for writing and running their test plans. Some specific documentation might be needed for testing specific features.</p><p class="calibre_2">The more <span class="italic">custom</span> documentation the designers are able to provide to QA, the easier and more effective the QA work will be. For example, whenever I design a new batch of cards for <span class="italic">Battlehand,</span> I create an ad hoc document for the QA where I include every card's render with a description of what the card effects are and what numbers are expected to appear on it. This document is quite different from the actual design documentation of each card, which consists of a line in a huge spreadsheet that contains the design of every card in the game. By creating this ad hoc document, I make sure the QA department knows only what it needs to look for, in a more accessible format that includes details that are irrelevant in the design phase (like the card artwork and final appearance).</p><p class="calibre_2">Remember that QA is your last chance, as a designer, to ship content of the highest quality. Making mistakes is only natural; you will make mistakes. A solid testing is the only way to avoid those mistakes going out to the public, who are going to notice them and who might be pretty unforgiving.</p><p class="calibre_2">A great way to make the most out of QA is to get your designs reviewed by either a QA manager or the tester that will be assigned to the feature. This way, you will get feedback on your features well before the official QA stage even starts. Getting this kind of thing done before entering the final 10% is a nice way to avoid accumulating too much work in that final stage, and will definitely help to reduce the risk of accumulating delays and falling out of track.</p><p class="calibre_2">QA might provide game designers some insights about gameplay that goes beyond the actual testing. In the end, we're talking of people that are going to play your game, or parts of it, hundreds of times, and they often have a level of expertise or feeling of the overall balancing that no developer or designer would be able to get in the same time window. Use that knowledge to keep improving the game!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_881"/>

But that's unlikely to happen in the real world - on the contrary, it is highly probable that you'll find yourself with much less time than expected to wrap everything up.</p><p class="calibre_2">Here is a list of tips and practices to avoid sacrificing polishing, proper user testing and, in the worst cases, procrastinating a game's release:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Review the game concept and game design pillars</span>: Cut anything that doesn't reflect them. The sooner this review is done, the better it is, but don't be afraid to cut a feature that appears to be in contrast with the original concept, even if it has been partially or fully developed.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Have a UX review</span>: Let a professional UX researcher study your game. A UX review will provide you with extremely useful insights and a lot of actionable points to improve the quality of your game.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Get the game out there</span>: Let other professional game developers try your game, and listen to their feedback. If you can, showcase your game at consumer fairs and show and pay attention to their reactions and feedback. There is a lot that can be learned by watching a real player trying your game.</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Release as soon as possible</span>: This is not always possible, but if you can take advantage of an early access version or a soft launch, go for it and test the game with a sensible amount of players.</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Test and iterate early on</span>.</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Keep track of your decisions and don't change them</span>: If you, or someone else, take the decision of cutting a feature, or adjust a design based on some compromise, note down why and when these decisions were taken. It might not make sense some months down the line and you might be tempted to revisit or reconsider some old decision...only to end up in the same problematic situation of months before. If you know and clearly remember what the reasoning behind a decision was, you are more likely to save time by not reconsidering and overthinking.</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Stick to the plan</span>: This is a very simple, but effective, advice. Anything that wasn't part of the original plan should be a red flag. What is the reason it was not part of the plan? Are you slipping into feature creeping?</li><li value="8" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Don't aim for absolute perfection</span>: Polishing is great, but it can really go on forever and nothing (and no one) is perfect. You should do the best work possible in the time you have.</li><li value="9" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Don't procrastinate</span>: Fixing bugs and starting polishing during production is the best way to save time when it's time to close the project and ship the game. Whenever you see a bug, if you have time to take care of it, just do it! There will be a final QA phase, but that's when the unexpected bug and problems should be addressed. Postponing every bug to the final QA, even those you were aware of and able to fix early on, is a mistake that will take a lot of your time when you will have very little available.</li><li value="10" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Don't be too passionate about your work, let a project manager decide</span>: Sometimes you can get stuck with design decisions. Two solutions might be both worth doing or trying. Don't let these moments of indecision block the development process. When in doubt, especially in bigger teams, ask and trust a lead, a producer, or a project manager. The reason to go for one solution rather than the other might be beyond your skills and just a matter of production requirements.</li><li value="11" class="calibre_9"><span class="bold">Be ready to accept and embrace failure</span>: Making games is not an exact science; it is also an art. You might follow every step by the book and do everything you are supposed to do and still fail. These moments are hard hits for teams and entire game companies, but there is more to learn from failure than from success. Treasure these experiences and analyze everything that went wrong. This experience is what will make you a veteran game designer.</li></ul><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">The screenshots used in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only.
