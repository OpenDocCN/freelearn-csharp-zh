<p class="mce-root">This section will focus on the necessity of delivering good code. The goal is to present techniques that will help you deliver good software that can be maintained and evolved continuously.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In <a href="82dfe57b-5fe6-4c71-9fa9-b4526a2c6f3e.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Best Practices in Coding C# 8</em>, we will present some coding best practices to help developers program safe, simple, and maintainable software. The chapter also includes tips and tricks for coding in C#.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In <a href="c707cf13-3616-4788-8f39-687bd1cb7c7b.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, <em>Testing Your Code with Unit Test Cases and TDD</em>, we will present code testing techniques and principles, taking the view that a necessary element of software development is ensuring that an application is bug-free and that it satisfies all specifications. Besides that, it will present test-driven development, a software development methodology that gives unit tests a central role.</p>
<p>Then, in <a href="47fba7aa-d9c6-46ad-b16a-1719f0d906f8.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>, <em>Using Tools to Write Better Code</em>, a bunch of the techniques and tools you need to achieve well-written code for your project will be presented. The idea here is that, although coding can be considered an art, writing understandable code is surely a philosophy, and there are tools that can help you with this.</p>
<p>This section includes the following chapters:</p>
