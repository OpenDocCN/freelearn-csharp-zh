But there are many other accounting tasks that have to be performed.</p><p>In this chapter, we will explore the following accounting processes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Posting accounting transactions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Reporting taxes - VAT (Tax Posting setup)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Managing fixed assets</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Inventory valuation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Closing the accounting year</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Consolidating financial statements</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Deferrals</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Posting accounting transactions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec26"/>Posting accounting transactions</h1></div></div></div><p>The system can automatically create and post many accounting transactions such as those for sales and purchase invoices, for instance. There are many other transactions that end up in an accounting entry automatically created by the system. We will actually see this in this chapter: taxes, fixed assets, inventory valuations, and so on.</p><p>You will probably need to post many other accounting transactions that are not managed by the system, such as payroll accrual entries, provisions, or others. You can post all these transactions using the <span class="strong"><strong>General Journal</strong></span>.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>General Journal</strong></span> can be accessed by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Financial Management</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>General Ledger </strong></span>and clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>General Journal</strong></span>.</p><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>General Journal</strong></span>, you manually create the necessary transaction lines, indicating the <span class="strong"><strong>Account No.</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Bal. Account No.</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Amount</strong></span> as shown in the following screenshot. There are many other fields that could be filled in, actually, but we will start with an easy example:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_03_01.jpg" alt="Posting accounting transactions"/></div><p>
</p><p>When posting this journal, the system will create six G/L entries: three on account <code class="literal">8720</code> with a debit amount, three on the account corresponding to the bank <code class="literal">WWB-OPERATING</code> with a credit amount.</p><p>Instead of indicating a balancing account on every single journal line, you can leave the <span class="strong"><strong>Bal. Account No.</strong></span> field empty and create a fourth journal line where you will indicate the balancing account and amount, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05733_03_02.jpg" alt="Posting accounting transactions"/></div><p>
</p><p>When posting this journal, the system will create four G/L entries: three on account <code class="literal">8720</code> with a debit amount, one on the account corresponding to the bank <code class="literal">WWB-OPERATING</code> with a credit amount.</p><p>On the <span class="strong"><strong>General Journal</strong></span>, you can create and post all the accounting transactions you need. There is no limit. Just keep in mind that when the accounting transaction you want to post involves customers, vendors, banks, or fixed assets, you should use the appropriate <span class="strong"><strong>Account Type</strong></span> rather than directly using the final G/L account to which the transaction has to be posted. This way, the transaction will also be reflected on the customer, vendor, bank, or fixed asset card.</p><div class="section" title="Standard Journal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec30"/>Standard Journal</h2></div></div></div><p>Transactions in a general journal are usually created manually by a user every time they have to post a new transaction. Some accounting transactions are used over and over, because they have to be posted once a week or once a month.</p><p>For those transactions, you can use the standard journals. A <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Journal</strong></span> is a transaction template that you create and can use as many times as needed.</p><p>To create a standard journal, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open the <span class="strong"><strong>General Journal</strong></span> page.</li><li class="listitem">Create the General Journal lines you want to save as a Standard Journal.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save as Standard Journal...</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Select <span class="strong"><strong>Code</strong></span> and enter a <span class="strong"><strong>Description</strong></span> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Standard Journal</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">You can choose whether you want to save the amount on the Standard Journal.

The journal lines are preserved after posting, so when you open them, they already contain journal lines that can be reviewed, adjusted, and posted on a recurring basis.</p><p>When using recurring journals with the reversing option, the system posts the transaction and it also posts the reversing entries on the following day. Another usage of recurring journals is to post allocations based on amounts or percentages.</p><p>You can find a recurring journal for the following journals:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Each General Journal type (general, assets, cash receipts, payments, inter-company, jobs, sales, and purchase)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Fixed asset journals</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Item journals</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Resource journals</li></ul></div><p>You create and post recurring journal lines just like you do with standard journals. Additionally, recurring journals have the following extra fields:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Recurring Frequency</strong></span>

<p>This contains a formula that determines how frequently an entry on the journal will be posted. For example, if the formula <code class="literal">1M</code> is entered, after the journal is posted, the date is changed by adding one month.</p>

<span class="strong"><strong>Allocations</strong></span> are used to allocate the amount on the recurring journal line to several G/L accounts and dimensions.

<span class="strong"><strong>Value-Added Tax</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>VAT</strong></span>) is a tax on consumption that is paid by the end consumer. VAT is calculated on sales and purchases and reported to the tax authorities periodically.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"/>Note</h3><p>The general concepts of VAT are the same in all countries where VAT applies. Statement and VAT rates differ from country to country. This book is based on the Dynamics NAV worldwide (W1) database. Most Dynamics NAV country versions include localizations on VAT.</p></div></div><p>In Dynamics NAV, VAT is calculated on sales and purchases invoices and credit memos. When the documents are posted, new VAT entries are created that will be used later on to report VAT to the authorities.</p><p>VAT is calculated based on the combination of <span class="strong"><strong>VAT Business Posting</strong></span> groups (the customer and vendor fix it) and <span class="strong"><strong>VAT Product Posting</strong></span> groups (the items and services fix it).</p><p>In <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. The Sales and Purchase Processes">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Sales and Purchase Process</em></span>, we have posted the sales invoice number as <code class="literal">103023</code>.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec33"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we learned how to post any accountancy transaction using journals. We explored how VAT entries are created when taxes are involved and how we can use them to report taxes to the authorities. We saw how to create a fixed asset and post its acquisition cost, revaluate it, calculate its depreciation, sell it, or cancel wrong entries.</p><p>In the annual accounting close section, we have learned the steps we need to perform in order to close the fiscal year, and in the inventory valuation section we came across different costing methods and how to reflect item costs into the general ledger. Finally, we have seen how to perform the consolidation of different subsidiary companies.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will take a look at the reporting tools available in Dynamics NAV. This way we will be able to analyze all the data collected in the system.</p></div></body></html>
