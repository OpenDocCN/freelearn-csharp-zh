<p class="NormalPACKT">This book is an approach to the implementation of Dependency Injection techniques across the new .NET Core 2.0 version. The designers of .NET Core implemented plenty of functionalities related to good practices and have followed the principles stated by Robert C. Martin (the SOLID principles) in distinct areas of this version.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">The purpose of this work is to go through those well-stated principles and identify and show through examples how they're implemented, and how they can be used by the programmer.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What this book covers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root"><a href="" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>The SOLID Principles of Software Design</em>, introduces you to the five SOLID principles and how they are found or can be easily implemented in .NET Core 2.0.</p>
<p><a href="" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Dependency Injection and IoC Containers</em>, gives you exposure to how Dependency Injection should be used either by itself or with the help of third-party containers.</p>
<p><a href="" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Introducing Dependency Injection in .NET Core 2.0</em>, reviews the real implementation of DI inside .NET Core 2.0 from the point of view of Console applications.</p>
<p><a href="" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core</em>, provides a more detailed study of the implementation of DI techniques inside web applications that use ASP.NET Core 2.0, full of samples.</p>
<p><a href="" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Object Composition,</em> takes you through all the hidden principles behind the concept of object composition and how it is applied in .NET Core 2.0 and ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, forming a pillar of DI.</p>
<p><a href="" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Object Lifetime,</em> the next DI pillar provides a deep dive into lifestyles maintained and typical management strategies, by the objects with DI in place, which enables better decision making with optimized configurations.</p>
<p><a href="" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Interception,</em> the last pillar of DI ecosystem, provides techniques to intercept calls and insert code dynamically into the pipeline. This chapter also deals with interception's application in .NET Core 2.0 and ASP.NET Core 2.0 with proper illustrations.</p>
<p><a href="" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Patterns – Dependency Injection,</em> walks you through the D of SOLID and all the important techniques to apply DI in applications with .NET Core 2.0.</p>
<p><a href="" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Anti-Patterns and Misconceptions on Dependency Injection,</em> deals with the common bad usage of DI patterns and scenarios to avoid while coding, in order to get a good outcome from DI in the application.</p>
<p><a href="" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a><em>, Dependency Injection in Other JavaScript Frameworks,</em> teaches you about Dependency Injection techniques using other popular frameworks, such as Angular.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="a437ff1b-c4af-41ac-b502-8718dc132272.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Best Practices and Other Related Techniques</em>, covers the well-proven coding, architectural, and refactoring practices that you should adopt while applying DI in your current and legacy applications.</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT">You will need Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition, the Chrome Navigator, and IIS (Internet Information Server Express) to successfully test and execute all code files.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Who this book is for</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="NormalPACKT">This book is for C# and .NET developers who have no idea what DI (Dependency Injection) is and would like to understand how to implement it in their applications.</p>

<p class="mce-root">In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "For this new requirement, we can create a new and overloaded the  <kbd>ReadData()</kbd> method that receives an extra argument."</p>
<p class="mce-root">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>    public Student(int id, string name, DateTime dob)
    {
      Id = id;
      Name = name;
      Dob = dob;
    }</pre>
<p class="mce-root">When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>    static void Main(string[] args)<br/>    {<br/>      Packt packt = new Packt<br/>      {<br/>         Name = "Packt Publications",<br/>         OfficialFacebookLink = "https://www.facebook.com/PacktPub/",<br/>         TotalBooksPublished = 5000<br/>      };<br/><br/>      <strong>packt.PrintPacktInfo();</strong><br/>      Console.ReadKey();<br/>    }</pre>
<p class="mce-root">Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>  npm install -g json</strong> </pre>
<p class="mce-root"><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Double-click on Add ArcGIS Server."</p>
<p>Warnings or important notes appear like this.</p>
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
