- en: This book will help you solve complex business problems by understanding users
    better, finding the right problem to solve, and building lean, event-driven systems
    to give your customers what they really want. You will be taken through the fundamentals
    of **Domain-Driven Design** (**DDD**) principles and how it can be applied using
    modern tools such as EventStorming, Event Sourcing, and CQRS. Through this book,
    you will learn how DDD applies directly to various architectural styles, such
    as REST, reactive systems, and microservices. You will empower teams to work flexibly
    with improved services and decoupled interactions.

    goes deeper into the modeling process, with more of a focus on artifacts that
    can help us to start writing code and deliver initial prototypes as soon as possible.'

    Model*, forms the basis for our domain model implemented in code. We will go through
    different styles of performing the behavior in domain entities and also write
    some tests.'

    shows how to implement commands, and how commands are the glue between our domain
    model and the world outside it. We will learn how to make our model useful by
    letting people interact with it.'

    traditional persistence mechanisms. We will cover the concept of event streams
    and see how streams relate to aggregates. We will use the Event Store to persist
    our aggregates in streams and load them back.'
