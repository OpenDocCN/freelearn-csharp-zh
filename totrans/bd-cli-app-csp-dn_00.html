			<p>CLI applications are everywhere! Once you start paying attention, you’ll begin to notice them.</p>
			<p>There’s a reason for their ubiquity: CLI applications enhance productivity by helping us stay focused on the task at hand and enabling the automation of repetitive tasks that would be error-prone if done manually. In fact, many graphical user interface (GUI) applications include a CLI option for precisely this reason.</p>
			<p>By learning how to develop your own CLI applications, you can deliver significant business value to your users and customers.</p>
			<p>And that’s exactly what we’ll explore together in the pages of this book!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for developers, architects, and software or DevOps engineers who recognize the value of CLI applications and want to create their own—whether to meet personal needs or those of their customers.</p>
			<p>To get the most out of this book, you should have a foundational understanding of .NET, along with practical experience in C# and Git.</p>
