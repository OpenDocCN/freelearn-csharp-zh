- en: As software projects grow in size and complexity, it can often become more difficult,
    time-consuming, and expensive to maintain them. Through Test Driven Development
    (TDD), you can learn to develop testable, extensible, and maintainable software
    applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for software developers who have cursory knowledge of TDD and are
    looking to gain a thorough understanding of how TDD can benefit them and the applications
    they produce. Software developers with an intermediate understanding of C# and
    the .NET Framework and/or a thorough understanding of JavaScript and React will
    likely be able to follow along with all the code examples used throughout the
    book.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book covers everything from why TDD is important to setting up testing environments,
    and how to get started testing a green-field application. As the reader grows
    more comfortable, they will be exposed to more advanced TDD topics such as abstracting
    away third-party code, approaching a problem from a TDD perspective, and how to
    deal with legacy code that wasn't written with testability in mind.

    is Important*, asks what is TDD and why should you care? In this chapter, you
    will learn what TDD is and why it matters. A compelling argument for TDD will
    be made and the benefits, and more importantly, the execution will be shown.'

    learn the importance of defining and testing boundaries and abstracting away third-party
    code (including the .NET Framework), and you''ll discover more advanced concepts
    such as spies, mocks, and fakes, and how to avoid pitfalls along the way.'

    if a bug is discovered? No problem, change a test or write a new one to cover
    the new requirement or to defend against the discovered bug. Now, write some new
    code or change some existing code to make all of the new/modified tests pass.

    your existing test suite will prevent you from introducing new bugs.'
