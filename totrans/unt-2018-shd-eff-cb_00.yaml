- en: '*Unity 2018 Shaders and Effects Cookbook* is your guide to becoming familiar
    with the creation of shaders and post-processing effects in Unity 2018\. You will
    start your journey at the beginning, exploring the Post Processing Stack to see
    some of the possible ways you can use shaders to affect what you see without having
    to write scripts at all. Afterwards, we learn how to create shaders from scratch,
    starting by creating the most basic shaders and learning how the shader code is
    structured. This foundational knowledge will arm you with the means to progress
    further through each chapter, learning advanced techniques such as volumetric
    explosions and fur shading. We also explore the newly added Shader Graph editor
    to see how you can create shaders through a drag and drop interface as well! This
    edition of the book is written specifically for Unity 2018 and will help you to
    master physically-based rendering and global illumination to get as close to photorealism
    as possible.'

    the quality of your shaders and even make your shader writing process more efficient.
    These chapters have been tailored so that you can jump into each section and learn
    a specific skill from beginner to expert. For those who are new to shader writing
    in Unity, you can progress through each chapter, one at a time, to build on your
    knowledge. Either way, you will learn the techniques that make modern games look
    the way they do.

    use in your Unity 3D games as well as the understanding to add to them, accomplish
    new effects, and address performance needs. So, let's get started!
