<p>With the pervasiveness of games and the use of gamification in nearly every industry, the desire to discover how to use state-of-the-art development software has never been so great. There is an increasing number of software tools available to help developers create amazing games for consoles, the web, desktop computers, and mobile devices. Game engines are among the most powerful of these tools available. The Unity 3D game engine is one of the elite game engines. It has been used to create popular 2D and 3D games by large game studios and indie developers. With a free version available, and the newest release of Unity, the time has never been better to start using Unity.</p>
<p><em>Getting Started with Unity 2018, Third Edition</em> covers one of the most popular game engines available. This book will guide you through the entire process of creating a 3D game, from downloading the Unity game engine to publishing your game. You will enjoy the coverage of some exciting topics in this book, including player-controlled characters and animation. Whether you are just getting started as a game developer or have experience with Unity or other game engines, this book will provide you with a guided tour of developing games with Unity 2018. With clear explanations, tips, and ample screenshots, you will be provided with detailed steps to develop your game.</p>
<p>This book takes a practice hands-on approach to learning Unity 2018. As you progress through each chapter, you will build a 3D interactive game called Cucumber Beetle. As you create the game, you'll learn the key features of Unity 2018, including creating a game environment, animating characters, scripting, and more. All meshes, models, textures, animations, and other assets are available on the book's website.</p>
<p>By the time you complete the lessons in this book, you'll have the confidence to start using Unity 2018 to create your own games.</p>
