- en: I have been working on .NET applications virtually from the very beginning of
    .NET. I think that I have worked with every possible .NET tool over the years,
    frontend and backend, good and bad! This has memorably included delivering training
    tools for processing facilities, building remote monitoring tools, and developing
    optimization solutions – all with .NET!

- en: In this book, I have tied together my experience from the many projects that
    I have worked on over the last 20 years to put together what I hope is an interesting
    and informative look at how to build modern **software-as-a-service** (**SaaS**)
    applications with .NET.

- en: This book is designed to detail and demystify the world of building SaaS applications
    with .NET and the Microsoft tech stack and aims to deliver the technical knowledge
    required to build, test, deploy, and maintain a modern SaaS application. We start
    off by introducing the technology that we will use and showcase it with a demo
    application. As we move through the book, we add additional tools and techniques,
    building up to the point that we have described and demonstrated all of the major
    topics required to build a SaaS application.

    required to develop modern SaaS applications that will impress your users and
    deliver value for your enterprise. We cover the full stack, from the database
    to the **user interface** (**UI**), and then onward to deploying and maintaining
    the application in production.

    used free and open source tools, and I have tried to always introduce new topics
    by linking them to core principles with as little assumed knowledge as possible.
    Where possible, I have illustrated the theory with practical examples.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    theory required and will have explored much of it through practical examples.
    You should be well on your way to delivering your first real-world SaaS application!

- en: This book is aimed at anyone who wants to build a SaaS application and is interested
    in using the Microsoft tech stack to build it! However, there is no shying away
    from the fact that SaaS development is a relatively advanced topic. It will stand
    you in good stead if you have a strong knowledge of C# and .NET. It will also
    be very useful to have a working knowledge of database and web development.

    beginner! In this book, even the more advanced topics are introduced and explained
    in an approachable way and generally underpinned with examples, such that there
    will be something to learn for everyone who wants to learn – regardless of skill
    level!
