    encounter, such as gaps in game design concepts, familiarity with Unity’s features
    and Scripting API, and proficiency in C# programming. Unity’s distinctive methodology
    for constructing game elements is central to our approach, emphasizing a component-based
    approach driven by C# scripts.

    of projects. We’ll start with a simple 2D object collection game and gradually
    progress to immersive 3D **first person shooter** (**FPS**) and **mixed reality**
    (**MR**) experiences. Each chapter builds on the previous one, introducing new
    concepts and techniques and providing practical examples, hands-on exercises,
    and the occasional challenge or bonus activity. This way, you’ll not only understand
    the theory but also gain valuable practical skills.

    materials, such as publishing games for commercialization, project continuance
    and version control, and supporting games throughout their lifetime. You’ll also
    gain insights into **Unity Gaming Services** (**UGS**) and the process of operating
    a game as a service. This comprehensive approach ensures that you’ll be well-prepared
    for all stages of game development.
