    <h1 id="_idParaDest-45" class="chapterTitle">From Blueprint to Reality: Building with Terrain and ProBuilder</h1>
    <p class="normal">Now that we’ve grasped all the necessary concepts to use Unity, let’s start designing our first level of the game. The idea in this chapter is to learn how to use Terrain tools to create the landscape of our game and then use ProBuilder to create the 3D mesh of the base with greater detail than using cubes. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to create a prototype of any kind of scene and try out your idea before actually implementing it with the final graphics.</p>
    <p class="normal">Specifically, we will examine the following concepts in this chapter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Defining our game concept</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating a landscape with Terrain Tools</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating shapes with ProBuilder</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by talking about our game concept, which will help us draft the first-level environment.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-46" class="heading-1">Defining our game concept</h1>
    <p class="normal">Before even adding the first cube to <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>our scene, it is good to have an idea of what we are going to create, as we will need to understand the basic concept of our game to start designing the first level. Throughout this book, we will be creating a shooter game, in which the player will be fighting against waves of enemies trying to destroy the player’s base.</p>
    <p class="normal">This base will be a complex in<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> a (not so) secret location bordered by mountains:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_03_01.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.1: Our finished game</p>
    <p class="normal">We will be defining the mechanics of our game as we progress through the book, but with this basic high-level concept of the game, we can start thinking about how to create a mountainous landscape and a placeholder player’s base.</p>
    <p class="normal">With that in mind, in the next section of this chapter, we will learn how to use Unity’s Terrain Tools to create our scene’s landscape.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-47" class="heading-1">Creating a landscape with Terrain</h1>
    <p class="normal">So far, we have used cubes to <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>generate our level prototype, but we also<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> learned that cubes sometimes cannot represent all possible objects we could need. Imagine something irregular, such as a full terrain with hills, canyons, and rivers. This would be a nightmare to create using cubes, given the irregular shapes you find in the terrain.</p>
    <p class="normal">Another option would be to use 3D modeling software, but the problem with that is that the generated model will be so big and so detailed that it won’t perform well, even on high-end PCs. In this scenario, we need to learn how to use Unity’s Terrain system, which we will do in this <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>first section of the chapter.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> will cover the following concepts related to terrains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Discussing Height Maps</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating and configuring Height Maps</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Authoring Height Maps</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Adding Height Map details</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let’s start by talking about Height Maps, whose textures help us define the heights of our terrain.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">A <code class="inlineCode">texture</code> is an image that is applied to different parts of 3D models to give them details. The concept is analogous to the sticker sheet in the toys of Kinder eggs, where you paste them on different parts of the toys to give them eyes or smiles. We will talk more about textures in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Seamless Integration: Importing and Integrating Assets</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-48" class="heading-2">Discussing Height Maps</h2>
    <p class="normal">If we create a giant area of the game with hills, canyons, craters, valleys, and rivers using regular 3D modeling tools, we will have a problem in that we will use fully detailed models for objects at all possible <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>distances, thus wasting resources on rendering details that we won’t see when the object is far away. In several instances in a game, players will need to view various parts of the terrain from considerable <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>distances, making efficient resource management a serious issue. Unity Terrain Tools uses a technique called Height Maps to generate the terrain in a performant and dynamic way. Instead of generating large 3D models for the whole terrain, it uses an image called a <strong class="keyWord">Height Map</strong>, which looks like a top-down black-and-white photo of the terrain.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the following image, you can see a black-and-white top-down view of a region of Scotland, with white being higher and black being lower:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_03_02.png" alt="Image result for height map"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.2: Scotland’s Height Map</p>
    <p class="normal">In the preceding image, you<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> can easily spot the peaks of the mountains by looking for the whitest areas of the image. Everything below sea level is black, while anything in the middle<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> uses gradients of gray, representing different heights between the minimum and maximum heights. The idea is that each pixel of the image determines the height of that specific area of the terrain.</p>
    <p class="normal">Unity Terrain Tools can automatically generate a 3D mesh from that image, saving us the hard drive space of having full 3D models of that terrain. Also, Unity will create the terrain as we move, generating high-detail models for nearby areas and low-detail models for faraway areas, making it a performant solution.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the following image, you can see the mesh that was generated for the terrain. You can appreciate that the nearer parts of the terrain have more polygons than the parts further away:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_03_03.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.3: Height Map generated mesh</p>
    <p class="normal">Take into account that this technology has its cons, such as the time it takes for Unity to generate those 3D models while we play and the inability to create caves. For now, however, that’s not a problem<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> for us.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we know what a <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>Height Map is, let’s see how we can use Unity Terrain Tools to create our own Height Maps.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-49" class="heading-2">Creating and configuring Height Maps</h2>
    <p class="normal">If you click on <strong class="screenText">GameObject | 3D Object | Terrain</strong>, you will see a giant plane appear on your scene, and a <strong class="screenText">Terrain</strong> object appears in <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>your <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong> window. That’s our terrain, and it is <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>plain because its Height Map starts all black, so no height whatsoever is in its initial state.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the following image, you can see what a brand-new <strong class="screenText">Terrain</strong> object looks like:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_03_04.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.4: Terrain with no heights painted yet</p>
    <p class="normal">Before you start editing this <strong class="screenText">Terrain</strong>, you must configure different settings such as the size and resolution of the Terrain’s Height Map, and that depends on what you are going to do with it. This is not the same as generating a whole world. Our game will feature the player’s base, which they<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> will defend, so the terrain will be small. In this case, an area that’s 200 x 200 meters in size surrounded by mountains will be enough.</p>
    <p class="normal">In order to configure our terrain <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>for those requirements, we need to do the following:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Select <strong class="screenText">Terrain</strong> from the <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong> or <strong class="screenText">Scene</strong> window.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Look at the <strong class="screenText">Inspector</strong> for the <strong class="screenText">Terrain</strong> component and expand it if it is collapsed.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the mountain and gear icon (the furthest-right option) to switch to configuration mode. In the following screenshot, you can see where that button is located:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_03_05.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.5: Terrain Settings button</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="4">Look for the <strong class="screenText">Mesh Resolution</strong> (<strong class="screenText">On Terrain Data</strong>) section.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Change <strong class="screenText">Terrain Width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Terrain Length</strong> to <code class="inlineCode">200</code> in both settings. This will say that the size of our terrain is going to be 200 x 200 meters.</li>
      <li class="numberedList"><strong class="screenText">Terrain Height</strong> determines <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>the maximum height possible. The white areas of our Height Map are <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>going to be that size. We can reduce it to <code class="inlineCode">500</code> just to limit the maximum peak of our mountains:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_03_06.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.6: Terrain resolution settings</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="7">Look for the <strong class="screenText">Texture Resolutions</strong> (On <strong class="screenText">Terrain Data</strong>) section.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Change <strong class="screenText">Heightmap Resolution</strong> to 257 x 257:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_03_07.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.7: Heightmap Resolution settings</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">Heightmap Resolution</strong> is the size of the Height Map image that will hold the heights of the different parts of the terrain. Using a resolution of 257 x 257 in our 200 x 200-meter terrain means that each square meter of <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>the terrain will be covered by a little bit more than 1 pixel of the Height <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>Map. The higher the resolution per square meter, the greater detail you can draw in that area size. Usually, terrain features are big, so having more than 1 pixel per square meter is generally a waste of resources. Find the smallest resolution you can have that allows you to create the details you need.</p>
    <p class="normal">Another initial setting you will want to set is the initial terrain height. By default, this is 0, so you can start painting heights from the bottom part, but this way, you can’t make holes in the terrain because it’s already at its lowest point. Setting up a small initial height allows you to paint river paths and pits in case you need them.</p>
    <p class="normal">In order to do so, do the following:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Select <strong class="screenText">Terrain</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong> panel.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Paint Terrain</strong> button (the second button).</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Set the dropdown to <strong class="screenText">Set Height</strong> if it’s not already there.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Set the <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> property to <code class="inlineCode">50</code>. This will indicate that we want all the terrain to start at <code class="inlineCode">50</code> meters in height, allowing us to make holes with a maximum depth of <code class="inlineCode">50</code> meters:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_03_08.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.8: Set Height Terrain tool location</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="5">Click the <strong class="screenText">Flatten All</strong> button. You will see all the terrain has been raised to the <code class="inlineCode">50</code> meters we specified. This leaves us with 450 more meters to go up, based on the maximum of 500 <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>meters we specified earlier.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have properly <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>configured our Height Map, let’s start editing it.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-50" class="heading-2">Authoring Height Maps</h2>
    <p class="normal">Remember that the Height Map is just an<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> image of the heights, so in order to edit it, we need to paint the heights in that image. Luckily, Unity has tools that allow us to edit the terrain directly in the editor and see the results of the modified heights directly. In order to do this, we must follow these steps:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Select <strong class="screenText">Terrain</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">Hierarchy</strong> panel.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Click the <strong class="screenText">Paint Terrain</strong> button (the second button, the same as in the previous section).</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Set the dropdown to <strong class="screenText">Raise or Lower Terrain</strong>:</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B21361_03_09.png" alt="" role="presentation"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.9: Raise or Lower Terrain tool location</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="4">Select the second brush in the <strong class="keyWord">Brushes</strong> selector. This brush has blurred borders to allow us to create softer heights.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Set <strong class="screenText">Brush Size</strong> to <code class="inlineCode">30</code> so that we can create heights that span 30-meter areas. If you want to create subtler details, you can reduce this number.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Set <strong class="screenText">Opacity</strong> to <strong class="screenText">10</strong> to<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> reduce the amount of height we paint per second, or click:</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.10: Smooth edges brush</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="7">Now, if you move the mouse in the <strong class="screenText">Scene</strong> view, you will see a little preview of the height you will paint if you click on that area. You may need to navigate closer to the terrain to see it in detail:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.11: Previsualization of the area to raise the terrain</p>
    <p class="normal">That checked pattern you can see allows you to see the actual size of the objects you are editing. Each cell represents a square meter. Remember that having a reference to see the actual size of the objects you are editing helps to prevent you from creating terrain features that are too big or too small. You could also put in other kinds of references, such as a big <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>cube with accurate sizes representing a building to get a notion of the size of the mountain or lake you are creating. Remember that the cube has a default size of <code class="inlineCode">1 x 1 x 1 </code>meters, so scaling to <code class="inlineCode">10,10,10</code> will give you a cube of <code class="inlineCode">10 x 10 x 10 </code>meters:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Hold, left-click, and drag the cursor over the terrain to start painting your terrain heights. Remember that you can press <em class="keystroke">Ctrl + Z</em> (<em class="keystroke">Command + Z</em> on Mac) to reverse any undesired change.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Try to paint the mountains all around the borders of our area, which will represent the background hills of our base:</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.12: Painted mountains around the edges of the terrain</p>
    <p class="normal">We now have decent starter <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>hills around our future base. We can also draw a moat around our future base. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Place a cube with a scale of <code class="inlineCode">50,10,50</code> in the middle of the terrain. This will act as a placeholder for the base we are going to create:</li>

    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="2">Select <strong class="screenText">Terrain</strong> and<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> the <strong class="screenText">Brush</strong> button once more.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Reduce <strong class="screenText">Brush Size</strong> to <code class="inlineCode">10</code>.</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.14: Moat around our placeholder base</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, we have a simple but good starter terrain that gives us a basic idea of how our base and its surroundings will look. Before moving on, we will apply some finer details to make our terrain look a little bit better. In the next section, we will discuss how to simulate terrain erosion <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>with different tools.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="normal">Before learning Unity, I was making games using DirectX, a low-level graphics library. While it was a challenge, I really enjoyed learning the algorithms needed to generate my own terrain system. While an engine provides a practical way to make games, making your own tools can also be a great way to better understand how those engines work, learn their capabilities and limits, and how to sort them.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-51" class="heading-2">Adding Height Map details</h2>
    <p class="normal">In the previous section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>created a rough outline of the terrain. If you want to make it look a little bit more realistic, then you need to start painting lots of tiny details here and there. Usually, this is done later in the level design process, but let’s take a look now since we are exploring Terrain Tools. Right now, our mountains look very smooth. In real life, they are generally sharper, so let’s improve that:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" class="numberedList">
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Select <strong class="screenText">Terrain</strong> and click the <strong class="screenText">Brush</strong> button as in the previous sections.</li>

      <li class="numberedList">Pick the fifth brush, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.15</em>. This brush has an irregular shape so that we can paint a<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> little bit of noise here and there.</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.16: Erosion generated with the aforementioned brush</p>
    <p class="normal">This has added some irregularity to our hills. Now, let’s imagine we want to have a flat area on the hills to put a <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>decorative observatory or antenna. Follow these steps to do so:</p>

      <p class="normal">If you want to dive deep into Terrain, there’s the Terrain Tools extension package, which adds more tools to sculpt it with finer details. Check this documentation: <a href="mailto:https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.terrain-tools@5.1"><span class="url">https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.terrain-tools@5.1</span></a> and also this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smnLYvF40s4"><span class="url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smnLYvF40s4</span></a> for more info.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">We could keep adding details <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>here and there, but we can settle with this for now. The next step is to create our player’s base, but first, let’s explore ProBuilder in order to generate our geometry.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-52" class="heading-2">Creating shapes with ProBuilder</h2>
    <p class="normal">So far, we have created simple scenes using cubes and primitive shapes, and that’s enough for most of the <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>prototypes you will create, but sometimes, you will have tricky areas of the game that would be difficult to model with regular cubes, or maybe you want to have some deeper <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>details in certain parts of your game to get an idea of how the player will experience that area.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this case, we can use any 3D modeling tool for this, such as 3D Studio Max, Maya, or Blender, but they can be difficult to learn, and you probably won’t need all your power at this stage in your development. Luckily, Unity has a simple 3D model creator called ProBuilder, so let’s explore it.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will cover the following concepts related to ProBuilder:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Installing ProBuilder</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Creating a shape</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Manipulating the mesh</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Adding details</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">ProBuilder is not included by<a id="_idIndexMarker140"/> default in our Unity project, so let’s start by learning how to install it.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-53" class="heading-2">Installing ProBuilder</h2>
    <p class="normal">Unity is a powerful engine full of features, but adding all those tools to our project if we are not using all of them can make<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> the engine run more slowly, so we need to manually specify which Unity tools we are using.

    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we learned how to create large terrain meshes using Height Maps and Unity Terrain Tools such as <strong class="screenText">Paint Height</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Set Height</strong> to create hills and rivers. Also, we saw how to create our own 3D meshes using ProBuilder, as well as how to manipulate the vertices, edges, and faces of a model to create a prototype base model for our game. We didn’t discuss any performance optimizations we can apply to our meshes or advanced 3D modeling concepts as that would require entire chapters and is beyond the scope of this book. Right now, our main focus is prototyping, so we are fine with our level’s current status.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will learn how to download and replace these prototyping models with final art by integrating assets (files) we have created with external tools. This is the first step to improving the graphics quality of our game, which we will finish by the end of <em class="chapterRef">Part 3</em>, <em class="italic">Improving Graphics</em>.</p>
