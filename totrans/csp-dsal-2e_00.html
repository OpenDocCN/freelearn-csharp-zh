<p><strong class="bold">Hello, I am Marcin!</strong> </p>
<p>It is so nice to meet you and to invite you to an amazing journey through various data structures and algorithms presented in this book. As you could already know, developing applications is certainly something exciting to work on, but it is also challenging, especially if you need to solve some complex problems. In such cases, you often need to take care of performance to ensure that the solution will work smoothly on devices with limited resources. Such a task could be really difficult and could require significant knowledge regarding not only the programming language but also data structures and algorithms. However, have you ever thought profoundly about them and their impact on the performance of your applications? If not, it is high time to take a look at this topic, and this book is a great place to start!</p>
<p>Did you know that replacing even one data structure with another could cause the performance results to increase hundreds of times or even more? Does it sound impossible? Maybe, but it is true! As an example, I would like to tell you a short story about one of the projects in which I was involved some time ago. The aim was to optimize the algorithm to find connections between blocks on a graphical diagram. Such connections should be automatically recalculated, refreshed, and redrawn as soon as any block has moved in the diagram. Of course, connections cannot go through blocks and cannot overlap other lines, and the number of crossings and direction changes should be limited. Depending on the size and the complexity of the diagram, the performance results differ significantly. However, while conducting tests, we received results in the range of 1 ms to almost 800 ms for the same test case. What was perhaps the most surprising aspect is that such a huge improvement was reached mainly by... changing the data structures of two sets.</p>
<p>Are you interested in knowing the influence of choosing a suitable data structure on the performance of your application? Do you want to know how you can increase the quality and performance of your solution by choosing the right accompanying algorithm? Are you curious about real-world scenarios where various data structures can be applied, as well as which algorithms could be used to solve some common problems? Unfortunately, the answer to such questions is not simple. However, within this book, you will find a lot of information about data structures and algorithms, presented in the context of the C# programming language, with many examples, code snippets, illustrations, and detailed explanations. Such content could help you to answer the aforementioned questions while developing the next great solutions, which could be used by many people all over the world! Are you ready to start your adventure with data structures and algorithms? If so, welcome on board of this book!</p>
<p>The book covers many data structures, starting with simple ones, namely arrays and a few of their variants, as representatives of random access data structures. Then, lists are introduced, together with their sorted, linked, and circular versions. The book also explains limited access data structures, based on stacks and queues, including a priority and a circular queue. Following this, we introduce you to the dictionary data structure, which allows you to map keys to values and perform fast lookup. The sorted variant of a dictionary is supported, as well. If you want to benefit from high-performance, set-related operations, you can use another data structure, namely a hash set. One of the most powerful constructs is a tree, which exists in many variants, including a binary tree, a binary search tree, a self-balancing tree, a trie, and a heap. The last data structure we analyze is a graph, supported by many interesting algorithmic topics, such as graph traversal, minimum spanning tree, node coloring, and finding the shortest path.</p>
<p>Arrays, lists, stacks, queues, dictionaries, hash sets, trees, tries, heaps, and graphs, as well as accompanying algorithms – a broad range of subjects await you on the next pages! Let’s start the adventure and take the first step toward your mastery of data structures and algorithms, which hopefully will have a positive effect on your projects and on your career as a software developer!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>

What is more, the source code for the accompanying projects is attached to the chapters and is available in the GitHub repository. Thus, you can easily run example applications and debug them without writing the code on your own.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the code can be simplified and it can differ from the best practices. The examples can have significantly limited, or even no, security checks and functionalities. Before publishing your application using the content presented in the book, the application should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it works correctly in various circumstances, such as in the scenario of passing incorrect data.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B18069_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Data Types</em>, introduces you to the topic of the data types available while developing applications in the C# programming language, both value and reference ones. You will learn about the built-in value types, such as integral or floating-point numbers, as well as constants, enumerations, value tuples, user-defined struct types, and nullable value types. As for the reference types, you will see object and string types, classes, records, interfaces, and delegate and dynamic types, as well as nullable reference types.</p>
<p><a href="B18069_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor063"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Algorithms</em>, presents you with an algorithm definition and some real-world examples from your daily life. Then, you will learn a few notations for algorithms, namely natural language, a flowchart, pseudocode, and a programming language. Various types of algorithms are shown as well, including recursive, divide and conquer, back-tracking, greedy, heuristic, brute force, and dynamic programming. Computational complexity, including time complexity, is also presented and explained.</p>
<p><a href="B18069_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor088"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Arrays and Sorting</em>, covers scenarios storing data using some representatives of random access data structures, namely arrays. First, three variants of arrays are explained, that is, single-dimensional, multi-dimensional, and jagged. You’ll also get to know seven popular sorting algorithms, namely selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, Shell sort, quicksort, and heap sort. All of these algorithms are shown with illustrations, implementation code, and detailed explanations.</p>
<p><a href="B18069_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor129"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Variants of Lists</em>, deals with other representatives of random access data structures, namely a few variants of lists. Lists are similar to arrays, but make it possible to dynamically increase the size of the collection if necessary. A few variants of lists, including a singly linked list, a doubly linked list, a circular singly linked list, and a circular doubly linked list are introduced. Such data structures are presented in illustrations, are implemented using C# code, and are explained in detail.</p>
<p><a href="B18069_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Stacks and Queues</em>, explains how to use two variants of limited access data structures, namely stacks and queues, including priority and circular queues. The chapter shows how to perform push and pop operations on a stack, and also describes the enqueue and dequeue operations in the case of a queue. To aid your understanding of these topics, a few examples are presented, including the Tower of Hanoi game and an application that simulates a call center with multiple consultants and callers.</p>
<p><a href="B18069_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor195"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Dictionaries and Sets</em>, focuses on data structures that make it possible to map keys to values, perform fast lookups, and carry out various operations on sets. The chapter introduces you to both non-generic and generic variants of a hash table, the sorted dictionary, and the high-performance solution to set operations allowing you to get union, intersection, subtraction, and symmetric difference. The “sorted” set concept is shown, as well.</p>
<p><a href="B18069_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor233"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Variants of Trees</em>, describes a few tree-related topics. First, it presents a basic tree, together with its implementation in C#, and examples showing it in action. The chapter also introduces you to binary trees, binary search trees, and self-balancing trees, namely AVL and red-black trees. Then, you’ll see a trie that is a great approach for performing string-related operations. The remainder of the chapter is dedicated to a brief introduction to the topic of binary heaps as other tree-based structures.</p>
<p><a href="B18069_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor296"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring Graphs</em>, contains a lot of information about graphs, starting with an explanation of their basic concepts, including nodes and a few variants of edges. The C#-based implementation of a graph is also covered. The chapter introduces you to two modes of graph traversal, namely depth-first and breadth-first search. Then, it presents the subject of minimum spanning trees using Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms, the node coloring problem, and finding the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm.</p>
<p><a href="B18069_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor367"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">See in Action</em>, presents a few examples of various types of algorithms. You’ll see a recursive way to calculate a number from the Fibonacci series, with dynamic programming optimization. Then, you’ll learn a greedy approach to a minimum coin change problem, a divide-and-conquer method of getting the closest pair of points, a recursive way of generating fractals, a back-tracking and recursive way of solving rat in a maze and Sudoku puzzles, as well as a genetic algorithm and brute-force password guessing.</p>
<p><a href="B18069_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor379"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Conclusion</em>, is the conclusion of all the knowledge acquired from the previous chapters. It shows a brief classification of data structures, dividing them into two groups, namely linear and nonlinear. Finally, the chapter talks about the diversity of applications of various data structures. Each data structure is presented with a brief description and some of them are also shown with illustrations, to help you remember the information learned while reading the previous nine chapters.</p>
