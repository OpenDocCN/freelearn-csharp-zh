- en: Xamarin's development tools have given us the power to develop native iOS, Android,
    and Mac applications in C#, which is one of the most popular programming languages.
    There are many advantages of choosing Xamarin to develop mobile applications instead
    of Java and Objective-C. You can share code between both the platforms and can
    be more productive by taking advantage of the advanced language features of C#
    and the .NET base class libraries. Alternatively, you would have to write the
    app twice for Android and iOS and lose the benefits of garbage collection when
    using Objective-C.

- en: In comparison to other techniques of developing cross-platform applications
    with JavaScript and HTML, Xamarin also has some distinct advantages. C# is generally
    more performant than JavaScript, and Xamarin gives developers direct access to
    the native APIs on each platform. This allows Xamarin applications to have a native
    look and perform in a manner similar to their Java or Objective-C counterparts.

- en: Xamarin's tooling works by compiling your C# into a native **ARM** executable
    that can be packaged as an iOS or Android application. It bundles a stripped-down
    version of the Mono runtime with your application that only includes the features
    of the base class libraries your app uses.

    developed by Novell to be used on Linux operating systems. Since iOS and Android
    are similarly based on Linux, Novell was able to develop MonoTouch and Mono for
    Android as products to target the new mobile platforms. Shortly after their release,
    another company acquired Novell, and the Mono team left to form a new company.
    Very shortly after, Xamarin was founded to focus completely on these tools for
    developing with C# on iOS and Android.'

- en: 'In this chapter, we discussed Xamarin''s core products for developing Android
    and iOS applications in C#: Xamarin Studio, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android.
    We installed Xcode and then ran the Xamarin all-in-one installer, which installs
    Java, the Android SDK, Xamarin Studio, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android. We set
    up the x86 Android emulator for a faster, more fluid experience when debugging
    applications. Finally, we set up iOS and Google Play developer accounts for distributing
    our applications.'

    more advanced features such as push notifications. In the next chapter, we'll
    create our first iOS and Android application and cover the basics of each platform.
