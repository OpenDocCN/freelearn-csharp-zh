- en: 'In this section, we will walk through the implementation of some concrete implementations
    of a RESTful web service. The section provides concrete approaches in the implementation
    and testing of a web service. In the first phase, we will focus on the implementation
    of the web service by differentiating it into three layers: data access, domain,
    and HTTP layer. Furthermore, we will see how to run the service locally by using
    some containerization technologies, and we will discover some concrete patterns
    for communication between multiple web services. Finally, we will have an overview
    on how to secure the service through the implementation of the token-authentication.'

    *REST 101 and Getting Started with ASP.NET Core*, the following examples require
    you to have .NET Core 3.1 installed on your OS. It is also suggested that you
    install an IDE that supports .NET Core, such as Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio
    for Mac, or the Rider IDE. You can use the Visual Studio Code as an alternative,
    but keep in mind that you will not have the IntelliSense and code analysis comfort
    provided by the other editors.
