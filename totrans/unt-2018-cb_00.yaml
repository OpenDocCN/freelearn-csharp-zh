- en: Game development is a broad and complex task. It is an interdisciplinary field,
    covering subjects as diverse as artificial intelligence, character animation,
    digital painting, and sound editing. All these areas of knowledge can materialize
    as the production of hundreds (or thousands!) of multimedia and data assets. A
    special software application—the game engine—is required to consolidate all these
    assets into a single product. Game engines are specialized pieces of software,
    which used to belong to an esoteric domain. They were expensive, inflexible, and
    extremely complicated to use. They were for big studios or hardcore programmers
    only. Then, along came Unity.

    and multimedia editing environment that is user-friendly and versatile. It has
    free and Pro versions; the latter includes even more features. Unity offers deployment
    to many platforms, including the following:'

    Some are students and hobbyists, but many are commercial organizations, ranging
    from garage developers to international studios, who use Unity to make a huge
    number of games—you might have already played some on one platform or another.

- en: This book provides over 170 Unity game development recipes. Some recipes demonstrate
    Unity application techniques for multimedia features, including working with animations
    and using preinstalled package systems. Other recipes develop game components
    with C# scripts, ranging from working with data structures and data file manipulation
    to artificial intelligence algorithms for computer-controlled characters.

    basic on timers), and detecting and responding to user input actions, such as
    mouseovers, while the first chapter introduced code UI for displaying values to
    the user. Among other things, there are recipes for panels in visual layers, radio

    doors, ammo for weapons, or choosing from a selection of items, such as from a
    collection of spells to cast. The recipes in this chapter offer a range of text

    objects and characters, which can lead to games with a richer and more exciting

    for the automation of object and character movement and pathfinding in your games.
    Objects can follow predefined sequences of waypoints, or be controlled by mouse
    clicks for point-and-click control. Objects can be made to flock together based
    on the average location and movement of all members of their flock. Additional
    recipes illustrate how the "cost" of navigation areas can be defined, simulating
    hard-to-travel areas such as mud and water. Finally, although much navigation
    behavior is pre-calculated at Design Time (the "baking" process), a recipe is
    presented illustrating how movable objects can influence path-finding at runtime
    through the use of the NavMesh Obstacle component.'

    independent templates for how to solve common problems. It teaches to avoid reinventing
    the wheel, learn about tried-and-tested approaches to solving common features

    work in the Unity Editor. Editor Extensions are scripting and multimedia components,
    which allow working with custom text, UI presentation of the game parameters,
    data in the Inspector and Scene panels, and custom menus and menu items. These
    can facilitate workflow improvements, allowing game developers to achieve their
    goals quicker and easier. Some of the recipes in this chapter include menu items,
    interactive panels with persistent storage, registering actions for the Undo system,
    deactivating menu items, progress bars, and ways to create new GameObjects based
    on prefabs.'
