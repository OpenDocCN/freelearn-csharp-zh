    due diligence and solution selling enablement, approaches for high quality solution
    implementation and upgrades, options for review and optimization, and the project
    and change management disciplines. We'll now shift our focus to another important
    area—how an organization can adopt Sure Step methodology—and use it to consistently
    deliver solutions to its customers.

    Step application via PartnerSource and CustomerSource, respectively. From these
    Microsoft portals, Sure Step can easily be downloaded and installed, unleashing
    all of the Sure Step content and tools in minutes. Project managers and consultants
    can also make themselves familiar with, and knowledgeable about, Sure Step through
    **Microsoft Official Courseware** (**MOC**), Microsoft Online learning, and Learning
    Snacks and **Instructor-Led Training** (**ILT**) courses provided by **Microsoft
    Certified Partners for Learning Solutions** (**CPLS**). This means that, with
    a modest time investment, organizations can obtain Sure Step methodology tools,
    content, and knowledge. So, is putting your organization on the Sure Step tracks
    as easy as pie? As many of us know, that couldn't be further from the truth. Any
    organization looking to adapt their processes to adopt a new implementation methodology
    is bound to face a certain set of challenges. To succeed, they will need an effective
    strategy, which they must execute properly while managing the organization change,
    and these are not exactly small matters!

    hand-in-hand. Strategy execution can be defined as *all of the actions necessary
    to turn your strategy into success*. A great strategy cannot compensate for a
    poor execution, and vice versa. The book *Strategy Execution Heroes*, *Jeroen
    De Flander*, *The Performance Factory*, lists four important differentiators when
    comparing strategy execution with strategy building. Strategy execution involves
    everyone in the organization, while strategy building is mostly reserved for a
    selected executive team. Strategy execution takes much longer than strategy building—it's
    a marathon versus a sprint. Execution requires short- and long-term thinking as
    short-term wins are a necessity to make execution a success. Strategy execution
    also requires a different skill set from strategy building. Successful strategy
    builders are champions in analytical thinking and opportunity identification,
    whereas executioners are masters in communication and coaching skills.

    satisfaction, and profitability levels in their Microsoft Dynamics implementations.
    During strategy building, we may look to define our quality goals as well as generate
    plans on how we could achieve those quality excellence goals using Microsoft Dynamics
    Sure Step as our vehicle. But having a strategic plan in and of itself does not
    guarantee success. A strategy, even a great one, doesn't implement itself! To
    turn the Sure Step strategy into execution, an organization will need to put a
    plan in place for a company-wide effort using management coaching support to detail
    the incremental steps needed to achieve quick wins on the way to a larger transformation.
    The execution of this process is a completely different ballgame as compared to
    acquiring resources with knowledge on how to drive implementations successfully.

    the good old habits in our personal and professional lives. Now think for some
    time about some of your change initiatives in your professional life. Did they

    reasons for failing change projects. A majority of companies do have a track record
    of failed change initiatives. Most of these failures were caused by typical change
    management challenges. If we want to successfully adapt to Sure Step, we need
    to have a strong execution plan to overcome these change management challenges.
    And awareness is the first step in this direction. People are creatures of habit

    ten reasons for failing change initiatives. Let's have a closer look at these
    reasons in the following sections.

    our objectives and company strategy? Will we sell more and become more profitable?
    What is our compelling reason for implementing this change? What are the business
    reasons for it? We need to make sure that our change initiative is connected to
    goal commitment and our company objectives and that we have a strong vision behind
    the desired change. Just like in soccer, we won't go far unless we know where
    the goalposts are. So the first thing to do is to understand what we want to accomplish!

- en: Do you feel comfortable about changing your way of doing things without knowing
    why? Of course you don't, and this applies to most people. When we introduce change
    to our staff, they need to know why the organization really wants and needs the
    change. What are the issues we want to resolve? Will it increase our performance
    and quality levels? Explain how this initiative fits in with the strategic plan.
    Will it help reach our targets? How? Leadership that introduces change into an
    organization must sell the vision to those that will be executing the change.
    They need to make this vision believable and achievable for the entire company
    by good communication and information. A lack of this essential communication
    is a disconnection between strategy and execution.

    our organization to overcome tradition and inertia. They need to be confident,
    inspired, and excited by the change introduced. As such they will evangelize the
    new procedures within the teams and help others bridge the gap to the new ways
    of working. They will also argue and overcome the criticism of those who do not
    believe in and resist the change. This coalition of supporters will act as your
    running mates in your campaign for a more effective and quality-driven company.
    The coalition needs to be powerful, including an authoritative mix of executive
    and non-executive roles within the different departments and disciplines in the
    company. We must invest time in the creation of such a group of believers before
    enforcing the use of any new tools or procedures in our organization. We need
    to identify the promoters and potential promoters within our organization. Both
    have a positive generic attitude towards change; they do not fear change and feel
    less insecure than others. The real promoters will welcome the particular change
    right away and will seek the advantages of the new ways of working with the speed
    of light. Potential promoters are not negative to change but they will not find
    the advantages as quickly. They just need that extra bit of encouragement to find
    the real value of the change. We need to get, and keep, both types of promoters
    on board during our change journey.

    them feel insecure. This is true for a majority of people, even for the ones promoting
    the change. However, some people fear change much more than others, and we are
    speaking about change in general. This may lead to resistance to any change. We
    need to know our opponents here and to manage their resistance from day one. The
    real opponents are usually not so difficult to identify. They have a strong negative

    for it as there are other things with a higher priority." We've heard them before,

    need to be coached and led into this change. There is no other choice; in fact,
    it is a management and leadership responsibility. Our challenge is to create awareness
    and build responsibility for this change in our organization. It is quite unlikely
    that the "do as I say" approach will bring us instant success in our transformation
    effort. We need people who really want to take responsibility for this change
    and performance, making coaching the better option. In essence, this is what leadership
    through change is all about—aligning the people force with a new vision and inspiring
    them to make it happen despite the obstacles. By coaching, we can involve our
    people in the change instead of imposing the change on them. People do what they
    think and feel, not what is imposed on them.

    in that company, and how we felt. There are many definitions of what a business
    culture is and they all point to the set of values and norms that are shared by
    people and groups in an organization. As this culture influences what we do and
    how we interact with colleagues, vendors, and customers, it represents the outer
    limit of what is achievable within that company. That's why our change project,
    our quest for more quality, needs to stick to the company's culture. We must reinforce
    the new norms and values and show the organization that they are an essential
    part of the culture. New recruits should be hooked up immediately to these new
    values, and for that to happen, incentives and promotions may become valuable
    instruments.

    work that is required. As we discovered in the previous chapters, Sure Step includes
    an impressive collection of tools and templates that may help you. Some are critical
    and required, some facultative and helpful, while some may not be of any immediate
    use to our specific needs. In the previous phase, we designed a set of these tools
    and templates to support our new processes. Some of the tools and templates may

    Envisioning with Sure Step*, and the notion applies to ISVs as well. A **vertical**
    solution is a subcategory of an industry, characterized by enterprises with similar
    products or services. For example, automotive, chemicals, and electronics are
    subcategories or verticals of the manufacturing industry. A vertical solution
    generally covers end-to-end processes, and it is accordingly designed to meet

    solution provider, this alignment can especially help you. In this section, we
    will learn how you can benefit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you already know, Sure Step is designed to assist with requirement gathering
    for the customer's solution. This leads up to a Fit Gap exercise to determine
    how much of the standard solution fits with the customer's requirements and whether
    any gaps exist that must be solved by other means. During the Fit Gap exercise,
    the **Value-Added Reseller** (**VAR**) and/or service provider may determine that
    a subset of the requirements can be best met by an ISV solution. If this determination
    occurs in the diagnostic presales phase, having appropriate documentation such
    as requirements questionnaires and Fit Gap worksheets would assist the VAR or
    service provider with selecting the right ISV solution. As an ISV provider, this
    is your primary benefit as it enables the selection of your ISV solution. Even
    if the determination occurs only during the implementation, foreseeably during
    the Functional Requirements and Fit Gap workshops in the Analysis phase, these
    documents will once again help the service providers ascertain that they are making
    the right ISV selection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously, making sure that your ISV solution is the one that gets picked is
    your primary goal. We will talk about other artifacts you can provide to increase
    the confidence level for the VARs or service providers. For now, let's continue
    with the additional benefits that you, as an ISV provider, can gain from aligning
    with Sure Step methodology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more recognized your ISV solution becomes in the Microsoft Dynamics ecosystem,
    the more demand you are going to have for your product, which without any doubt,
    is a good problem to have. But with that also comes organizational scale issues.
    Do you have the resources to assist on multiple sales opportunities, or do you
    have the resources to support implementation questions as they arise? Having your
    process and documentation aligned with Sure Step can help you address these questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other inherent benefits of the Sure Step alignment are alleviating project
    risks and improving solution delivery times. As we have learned in the prior chapters,
    having a consistent, repeatable, and end-to-end life cycle method that Sure Step
    provides helps the service provider decrease the overall risks and issues that
    may arise during the engagement. This, in turn, can also lead to reduced deployment
    times, thereby reducing the overall solution delivery costs for the customer.
    If your ISV application is a component of the overall solution being deployed
    for the customer, ensuring that it also aligns with Sure Step will only help make
    life easier for the implementation team. They will be able to find artifacts for
    the appropriate activities, thereby reducing the overall delivery time for this
    component. They will also be using a single taxonomy in describing and implementing
    the overall solution, which is not something to overlook. The customer user base
    goes through enough churn as it is during the course of an **Enterprise** **Resource
    Planning** (**ERP**) or **Customer Relationship Management** (**CRM**) solution
    implementation; they do need to also have to figure out multiple terms thrown
    at them to describe the same task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having good Sure Step-based documentation can also reduce the time taken for
    a service provider to become an expert on your ISV solution. As these consultants
    go into other engagements, they become evangelists for your product, resulting
    in more demand. Also, the documentation can help the consultants deliver quality
    training for this part of the overall solution to the customer's users.

    all of these documents in one fell swoop. This list should help you think about
    areas that will help the sales and implementation teams that represent and deploy
    your product. Use judgment to decide which areas need to be worked on immediately
    and which ones you can develop and provide as your business evolves. In the next
    section, you can also find a table with recommendations of templates for the **Certified

- en: The CfMD program introduced by Microsoft applies high quality and testing rigor
    to partner-developed business management solutions. CfMD solutions are tested
    by an independent company and also go through verification by customers. By committing
    to the quality requirements of the CfMD program, the ISV solutions are provided
    higher visibility and afforded increased marketability to the resellers and customers.
    These solutions offer customers and resellers a lower risk profile in that they
    are used and recommended by other companies in the industry, are thoroughly tested
    and proven to meet Microsoft's highest standards for partner solutions, and very
    importantly, are tested as being compatible and integrated with Microsoft Dynamics
    and Microsoft technology solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the main objectives of the certified solutions is to provide trusted,
    lower-risk solutions that can be implemented faster and maintained more easily
    when the solution is in production. As such, in conjunction with the Sure Step
    2010 release, the CfMD program introduced best practice guidance on the Sure Step
    artifacts to be developed by Microsoft Dynamics ISV solution providers. The CfMD
    program also instituted a requirement for the ISV organization to have one or
    more resources with Sure Step methodology certification to ensure alignment with
    Sure Step.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case study, we look at the journey of a small Dynamics partner (let's
    call them Partner1) to adopt Sure Step methodology. The clientele of Partner1
    is predominantly in the **Small-to-Medium Enterprise** (**SME**) space. Partner1
    is a VAR and solution implementer whose main focus is not only the Microsoft Dynamics
    CRM solutions, but also undertaking smaller ERP engagements. Partner1 has 24 employees,
    including six in sales, 15 in consulting, and three in administrative/accounting/infrastructure
    roles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Partner1 was struggling in two areas: a spotty win-loss ratio on the opportunities
    it was chasing and inconsistency in its solution delivery resulting in less-than-satisfied
    customers. In a way, the two issues were tied together: the lack of good customer
    references was causing it to lose out to the competition more often than not.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The CEO of Partner1 first learned of Sure Step at a Partner Conference, where
    he was also able to see a demo of the methodology. He came away impressed with
    the capabilities, and also felt that it could help his organization in both of
    its current struggles. But before embarking on the evaluation exercise, he wanted
    to get affirmation from others in his organization that this was worthwhile to
    pursue, and he accordingly asked his Consulting Director to evaluate whether Sure
    Step would be a good fit for them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Consulting Director of Partner1 and a Senior Project Manager reviewed the
    100-level online training course on Sure Step, accessible through PartnerSource.
    They were also convinced that the time and effort to further evaluate Sure Step
    would be money well spent, with the Consulting Director going as far as feeling
    that it was essential to their survival as an organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a first step, they downloaded Sure Step from Microsoft's PartnerSource website
    to get a better grasp of the guidance, artifacts, and tools available to them.
    The second step was to institute a Train-the-Trainer model, where the Senior Project
    Manager would undertake a deep-dive, instructor-led classroom training on Sure
    Step and then come back and educate the rest of the organization on Sure Step.
    After other key consulting resources received training on Sure Step, the company
    would evaluate whether and how the methodology needed to be customized to fit
    their processes. They would also select a project and use Sure Step on a trial
    basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the plan was fairly logical, the execution did not quite pan out as Partner1
    had intended. First, while the training that the Project Manager attended delivered
    the Sure Step knowledge, Partner1 still needed to go through an exercise of mapping
    their processes and deliverables to Sure Step methodology. This required dedicated
    resources and time. This was task that the Project Manager, whose primary job
    was to keep his/her current customer project on the right track, did not have
    the luxury to carry out. Partner1 also felt a bit overwhelmed by the documentation
    that they thought was needed in Sure Step and struggled with aligning their internal
    taxonomies between sales and delivery. Finally, as the sales team was not involved
    in this exercise, the selling motions, and more importantly the deliverables promised
    by the sales teams were not aligned with the new approach that the delivery team
    wanted to take. The project stayed mired on the shelf, and it was business as
    usual for Partner1\. The problem was that their sales and delivery struggles continued
    as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this juncture, the CEO was able to meet with a Microsoft executive and another
    partner at an event. The discussion and follow-up notes exchanged affirmed his
    belief that Sure Step could help alleviate his company's struggles and also led
    him to go after a more sound adoption approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Partner1 decided to use the Sure Step Adoption Roadmap for guidance. Having
    already identified a compelling reason to adopt Sure Step, the first step for
    Partner1 was to assign a Sure Step champion for the project. The Project Manager
    was designated as the Sure Step champion, and she was also relieved of some of
    her day-to-day pressures so as to be able to focus on the adoption. Partner1 nominated
    a V-team that comprised of a Sales Manager, the Consulting Director, and other
    consultants. The team availed of the Sure Step Online self-assessments to analyze
    where they were as an organization and what steps they needed to take to improve
    their processes.

    processes to align them to Sure Step. Partner1 decided to begin with a subset
    of the documents that were important to the sales and delivery processes—the key
    documents designated by Sure Step, as shown in the following screenshot:'

    the Agile project type, while they selected the Standard project type for their
    ERP implementations. Using Sure Step's Projects functionality, the teams adapted
    the Sure Step templates and created Partner1-centric deliverable documents for
    their CRM and ERP solutions. The **Statement of Work** (**SOW**) template provided
    to the customers at the end of the sales cycle was also recreated and aligned
    to the new Sure Step deliverables.

    as needed before requiring their usage on all projects. They also instituted periodic
    reviews of their projects and processes to ensure that their lessons learned were
    being transferred to future engagements.

    Sure Step to show their customers that they have a viable approach to deliver
    the promised solutions. Not only are they closing more opportunities, but customer
    satisfaction is also high, as are employee morale and retention rates.
