- en: This book is an approach to the implementation of Dependency Injection techniques
    across the new .NET Core 2.0 version. The designers of .NET Core implemented plenty
    of functionalities related to good practices and have followed the principles
    stated by Robert C. Martin (the SOLID principles) in distinct areas of this version.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of this work is to go through those well-stated principles and identify
    and show through examples how they're implemented, and how they can be used by
    the programmer.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 1, *The SOLID Principles of Software Design*, introduces you to the
    five SOLID principles and how they are found or can be easily implemented in .NET
    Core 2.0.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 2, *Dependency Injection and IoC Containers*, gives you exposure to
    how Dependency Injection should be used either by itself or with the help of third-party
    containers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 3, *Introducing Dependency Injection in .NET Core 2.0*, reviews the
    real implementation of DI inside .NET Core 2.0 from the point of view of Console
    applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 4, *Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core*, provides a more detailed
    study of the implementation of DI techniques inside web applications that use
    ASP.NET Core 2.0, full of samples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 5, *Object Composition,* takes you through all the hidden principles
    behind the concept of object composition and how it is applied in .NET Core 2.0
    and ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, forming a pillar of DI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 6, *Object Lifetime,* the next DI pillar provides a deep dive into lifestyles
    maintained and typical management strategies, by the objects with DI in place,
    which enables better decision making with optimized configurations.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 7, *Interception,* the last pillar of DI ecosystem, provides techniques
    to intercept calls and insert code dynamically into the pipeline. This chapter
    also deals with interception's application in .NET Core 2.0 and ASP.NET Core 2.0
    with proper illustrations.

- en: Chapter 8, *Patterns – Dependency Injection,* walks you through the D of SOLID
    and all the important techniques to apply DI in applications with .NET Core 2.0.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapter 9, *Anti-Patterns and Misconceptions on Dependency Injection,* deals
    with the common bad usage of DI patterns and scenarios to avoid while coding,
    in order to get a good outcome from DI in the application.

- en: Chapter 10*, Dependency Injection in Other JavaScript Frameworks,* teaches you
    about Dependency Injection techniques using other popular frameworks, such as
    Angular.

    Other Related Techniques*, covers the well-proven coding, architectural, and refactoring
    practices that you should adopt while applying DI in your current and legacy applications.'
