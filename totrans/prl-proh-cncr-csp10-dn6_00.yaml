- en: Parallel programming and concurrency have become prevalent in modern software
    development. In this book, you will learn how to leverage the latest asynchronous,
    parallel, and concurrency features in .NET 6 when building your next application.
    We will explore the power of multithreaded C# development patterns and practices.
    By exploring the benefits and challenges of threading in .NET through concise,
    real-world examples, choosing the right option for your project will become second
    nature.

- en: You have many choices when introducing multithreading to a new or existing .NET
    application. The goal of this book is to not only teach you how to use parallel
    programming and concurrency in C# and .NET but also to help you understand which
    of the constructs to choose for a given scenario. Whether you are developing for
    desktop, mobile, the web, or the cloud, performance and responsiveness are key
    to the success of an application. This book will help every type of C# developer
    to scale their applications to their users’ needs and avoid the pitfalls often
    encountered with multithreaded development.

    covers the basics of working with managed threading in .NET. We will discuss how
    to create and destroy threads, handle exceptions, synchronize data, and the objects
    provided by .NET to handle background operations. You will gain a basic understanding
    of how threads can be managed in a .NET application. Practical examples in this
    chapter will illustrate how to use managed threading in C# projects.'
