			<p class="author-quote">“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.”</p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Martin Golding</p>
			<p>In the world of software, there are so many things that can go wrong and often do go wrong. We’re a relatively young industry that is in an ever-changing state. Things haven’t settled and innovation happens at lightning speed. It’s not like carpentry, which has had a few thousand years of experience of what works and what doesn’t. In software, we’re still inventing the tools and reinventing them as we go. The business benefit and the possibility to increase productivity for our end users sets the expectations high and in an increasingly competitive market, time to market is of <span class="No-Break">the essence.</span></p>
			<p>At the level we write our software today, we have a huge potential to leverage the metadata surrounding our own code to ensure the quality and maintainability of the software we write. This is where the metaprogramming <span class="No-Break">journey starts.</span></p>
			<p>Metaprogramming can be really fun to work with, but it represents true opportunities for developers and businesses to set themselves apart. Things that metaprogramming can do for you include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Improve the maintainability of your code</li>
				<li>Automate tedious tasks</li>
				<li>Let developers focus more on your business and not the plumbing</li>
				<li>Help you stay more compliant</li>
				<li>Reduce risk related to security</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are technical reasons to dive into metaprogramming, as with any other technique, but I think there is true value to be discovered in leveraging it to help you and your team become more productive and, at the end of the day, deliver more business-critical features that are easier to change and maintain over <span class="No-Break">the years.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>The book is for any C# developer who is curious about metaprogramming and what it could do for you. More specifically, the following personas are the <span class="No-Break">target audience:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Developers who are familiar with C# and .NET as a runtime looking to expand their horizons and learn in more depth about the .NET runtime and compiler capabilities</li>
				<li>Software architects familiar with C# and .NET and looking for inspiration on how to improve their architecture</li>
				<li>CTOs or development managers with either a developer background or who understand software development and want inspiration to potentially grease the wheels of the developer organization</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B19418_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="ita ic">How Can Metaprogramming Benefit You?</em>, dives into what metaprogramming is and how it can improve developers’ day-to-day work. It gives some concrete basic examples to explain <span class="No-Break">its capabilities.</span></p>

In addition, it gives an insight into how the .NET <span class="No-Break">runtime works.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19418_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041"><span class="No-Break"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="ita ic">Demystifying through Existing Real-World Examples</em>, shows how Microsoft, as an example, leverages metaprogramming and how you probably already <span class="No-Break">use it.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19418_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor059"><span class="No-Break"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="ita ic">Reasoning about Types Using Reflection</em>, provides an overview of how powerful the .NET runtime reflection is and how its implicit metadata can <span class="No-Break">be leveraged.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19418_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor083"><span class="No-Break"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="ita ic">Leveraging Attributes</em>, introduces leveraging C# attributes as an explicit metaprogramming technique and how it can be used, giving real-world <span class="No-Break">applicable examples.</span></p>
