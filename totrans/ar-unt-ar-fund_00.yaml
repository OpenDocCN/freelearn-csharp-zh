    the real world through digitally enhanced content. This book will help get you
    started developing your own AR applications using the Unity 3D game engine and
    the AR Foundation toolkit provided by Unity Technologies Inc. Using the techniques
    and lessons presented in this book, you will be able to create your own AR applications
    and games for a variety of target devices.'

    and tablets, both iOS (ARKit) and Android (ARCore), and a new generation of wearable
    smart glasses. In this book, I focus on instructing you on how to develop AR applications
    for mobile devices, but the techniques and projects can also be applied to wearables.

    that add layers of information to the real world, enabling interaction with real
    and virtual objects and innovatively engaging your users.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to develop your own AR applications, I recommend using Unity with
    AR Foundation as it is one of the most powerful and flexible platforms. Developers
    interested in creating AR projects can use this book to accelerate their progress
    on the learning curve and gain experience through a variety of fun and interesting
    projects. This book complements Unity's own documentation and other resources
    and provides practical advice and best practices that will have you up and running
    and productive quickly.

- en: You do not need to be a Unity expert to use this book, but some familiarity
    will help you get started more quickly. If you are a beginner, I recommend you
    first run through one or two introductory tutorials found on Unity Learn ([https://learn.unity.com/](https://learn.unity.com/)).
    It may also be helpful to have some experience developing for mobile devices (iOS
    and/or Android).

    curve slowly at first and then faster as you gain experience. And I provide plenty
    of links to external resources if you want to learn more and explore specific
    topics in more depth. Experienced readers can push past the instructions and explanations
    they already know.

    for AR Development*, after briefly defining AR, gets you set up for AR development,
    installing the Unity 3D game engine and the AR Foundation toolkit, and ensuring
    your system is ready to develop for Android (ARCore) and/or iOS (ARKit) mobile
    devices.'

    AR Scene*, jumps right into building and running AR scenes, starting with examples
    provided in the AR Foundation samples project from Unity, and then moving on to
    building your own simple scene from scratch, learning about ARSession components,
    prefabs, and a little bit of C# coding too.'

    graphics, which we will save as a template for reuse in other projects in this
    book.'

    using the AR user framework created in the previous chapter, including a main
    menu and a PlaceObject mode and UI. This chapter also discusses some advanced
    issues, such as making AR optional, determining device support, and adding localization
