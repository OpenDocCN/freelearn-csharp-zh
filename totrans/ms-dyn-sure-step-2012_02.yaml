    for the selection and delivery of business solutions. We discussed the benefits
    of having a methodology for both the service provider and the customer. Not only
    does a methodology provide a consistent and repeatable approach via workflows
    and processes, but it also provides a connection to the various disciplines, and
    the orchestration of multiple roles that are involved in solution delivery execution.

    the notion of full life cycle methodologies. A customer life cycle methodology
    encompasses the solution discovery phase, solution delivery phases, and continues
    through the operation and any future upgrades of the solution. Beginning with
    the discovery phase, a full life cycle methodology provides a structured process
    for solution evaluation as well as proper dissemination of the knowledge that
    is captured during the diagnostic phase through to the solution delivery phases,
    thereby ensuring that the final solution design aligns with the original solution
    vision.

    Period! As we discussed in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Background and Concepts"),
    *Background and Concepts*, ERP and CRM solutions are mission critical because
    of the core functions that they support, including quote-to-order entry, order
    fulfillment, receipts and payments, HR and payroll, inventory management, demand
    forecasting and sales pipeline, and customer relationship management. Based on
    the number of organizational functions that interface with these solutions and
    the extent to which they depend on these systems, it is easy to see the impact
    of the system on that organization. A good sales team will articulate this value
    during the sales cycle, and position the solution in terms of metrics that the
    customer can relate to.

    when there is a value associated with the solution. Executive support is absolutely
    critical for a project of such magnitude, both in the solution selection stage
    as well as during solution delivery. During the implementation of the solution,
    the solution delivery team is bound to go through peaks and valleys. When there
    are clearly defined value projections, these will be the drivers and motivation
    factors for the team to keep forging ahead through its struggles.

- en: The most important aspect of driving value for the customer is ensuring that
    the right solution is being positioned to meet the organizational requirements.
    A good sales team always keeps its customer's needs at the forefront. Always strive
    to do what's best for the customers and their organization, even if it means walking
    away from an opportunity if you determine that it is not the right fit for your
    solution. This is where ethics come in, but when sales teams follow this thought
    process, they will have appreciative and loyal customers. And over the long run,
    they will end up on the winning side, and be able to feel good about their accomplishments.

    that *Covey* espouses is *Think Win/Win*, which is applicable to our current discussion.
    Highly effective sales personnel will strive for win-win deals because both parties

    influence of quotas and bonuses on sales behavior. However, by aligning the right
    solution for the customer, the sales personnel can get their individual goals
    accomplished while also helping organizations achieve their potential. This should
    give them a sense of gratification that extends well beyond the period-end bonuses.
    Long-term values can be achieved through a due-diligence process that engages
    and informs the customer through the sales process. Solution providers that establish
    such a culture and inculcate these values in their organizations are in turn successful
    in the long run.

    capture the baseline metrics—the values of the KPIs in the current (as-is) state.
    This is important because without establishing the baseline metrics, you will

    determining the actual savings produced by the solution.

    timing and frequency of when the measurements will be taken. The actual execution
    of measuring the results will typically happen only when the solution is actually

    measurements will occur. They should also decide the frequency of the measurements

    Quite simply, the word "solution" means an answer to a problem. But the English
    Thesaurus offers us other terms such as key, clarification, elucidation, explanation,
    resolution, and result. All of these definitions fit quite nicely into the constructs
    of business-solution selling, and therein lies the crux of the issue—"solution"
    can mean different things to different people. Because a solution can be applied
    to multiple contexts, it is a commonly used and sometimes abused word in organizations;
    hence, there is the need to clearly define the usage of the term.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In his book, *The New Solution Selling*, *Keith Eades*, who founded the **Sales
    Performance International** (**SPI**) organization, discusses the definition of
    solution. He describes a solution as "a mutually agreed-upon answer to a recognized
    problem, with a specific emphasis on the need for the problem to be acknowledged
    by both parties, the buyers (customers) and the sellers (solution provider)".
    The second aspect of a solution that is highlighted in the book is that it should
    "provide some measurable improvement". With that, *Eades* submits the following
    definition of a solution:'

- en: For some organizations, it has become very fashionable to say that they have
    "solutions" and that they are "solutions-focused" as this apparently takes away
    the negative connotation associated with the term "products". A product is viewed
    as an offering that the selling company is forcing on the marketplace, while a
    solution is viewed as something that the marketplace is actively seeking, with
    the solution being the answer that the sellers can offer to the buyers. So, is
    the product the antithesis of a solution? Far from it! In many cases, and especially
    in the context of business solutions, the product is the primary driver of the
    solution. But it is the usage or delivery of that product that can truly define
    the success or failure of the solution for the customer. And the up-front positioning
    of the solution is the key to a successful delivery, which is where the solution-centric
    approach comes in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For an organization to be truly solution focused, Eades explains that they need
    "more than superficial packaging manipulations or bundling services with products".
    Solution-centric should not be treated as buzz word to be thrown around by the
    organization. In the book titled *The Solution-Centric Organization*, Eades states
    that "solution–centric organizations define themselves by the problems they solve
    for customers versus by the products or services they make, sell or deliver".
    Solution-centric should be a philosophy that permeates throughout the organization
    so that teams including sales, marketing, product development, and services are
    all aligned around a common approach and model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The need to be truly solution-centric is even more important in mature marketplaces
    such as ERP/CRM solutions. In this market, many of the top solution providers
    offer products that have been around for a while and used by many organizations.
    Each of these products includes a set of base features and functionality that
    may be hard to differentiate from the competition. **Schedule Performance Index**
    (**SPI**) terms this as **differentiation blur** that is a result of the product
    being perceived as commoditized, or the product becoming too complex and feature-rich
    for the industry to be able to differentiate it from others. To combat this issue,
    companies start bundling their products with services, and deem these as solutions.
    But what they have really achieved is creating what SPI labels as "pseudo solutions".
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such approaches neither help the customers looking for a solution nor do they
    help the solution provider develop a consistent approach to selling. This is further
    corroborated by a market research by industry analysts, who found only a 10 percent
    effectiveness rate of value positioning by these solution providers. The research
    also points to other findings that are endemic in a pseudo-solution company. In
    such companies, a high percentage (70 to 80 percent) of the marketing materials
    remain unused, highlighting the disconnect between the sales and marketing teams.
    The research also finds that these companies then revert to sales training as
    a means to solve the problem, but they often find the shelf life of unreinforced
    sales training to be about six to eight weeks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, how then does a company become truly solution-centric? As SPI puts it, for
    a true solution-centric approach, organizations need to embrace a sustained business
    model to market, sell, and deliver customer transformation. They need to identify
    the problems they solve rather than the products they offer, align all of the
    aspects of their marketing with the solution framework, and systemically adopt
    and reinforce the solution selling and solution-centric disciplines across the
    entire organization. Companies doing this will find themselves being able to consistently
    position the value of their solutions to their customers to clearly differentiate
    the value vis-à-vis their competition, and create a business model for sustainable
    growth.

    action. While the former is a better process for the service providers' sales
    personnel, the latter is a better mechanism for the customers in their product-selection
    process. So, a good solution selling process aids the solution provider while
    innately assisting the customer and ensuring a thorough due diligence process,
    which in turn sets the stage for a good solution delivery process. Granted that
    there will always be the likelihood of the process being skewed towards the product
    that the solution provider is representing, however, if the process is conducted
    properly, the customer should be able to clearly determine the extent of the fit
    between their requirements and the solution, as well as what their future solution
    will look like.

    or service that they are acquiring is the best solution to their problem, and
    they are getting it at the best possible price. As the magnitude of the purchase
    increases, so does the buyer's inclination to research on the marketplace to seek
    out the right solution at the right price for their needs. Essentially, the length
    of the due diligence process for the buyer increases exponentially with the importance
    of their requirement. However, there is one more factor that can affect the buyer's
    due diligence process, and that is trust—trust that the solution will meet their
    needs, trust in the sellers that they are providing the best price, trust that
    the sellers will deliver the promised solution, and trust that the sellers have
    the wherewithal to support the solution, should any problems arise after the delivery.

    established provider. Why is that? This is because the customers do not have the
    same level of trust in the new provider as they would in an established one. This
    is an all the more important reason for the selling organizations to adopt solution
    selling as a philosophy. Solution selling is one of the best techniques available

    as business solutions. These are not transactions that you would expect somebody
    to make over the Internet or by some other "sight unseen" method. Customers will
    want to establish that the solution is credible, the team delivering the solution
    is trustworthy, and the organization supporting the solution will be around for
    the long haul. But let's assume that all things are equal or close enough that
    the differentiation is not obvious—for example, the competition also has a mature
    solution as well as trustworthy and personable sales personnel. The key point
    in Bosworth's notion is that when the sellers can make the buyers feel that the
    solution is theirs and matches their vision, the buyers feel that they are in
    control of the process, and they are empowered.

    As the customers move through their buying cycle, their concerns change over time.

    the vision in lockstep with the buyer. When the buyer is able to clearly visualize

    less complicated, resulting in shorter sales cycles and higher close ratios.

    the buyer. Sellers functioning at this level do so by projecting their vision
    of the need for the solution on the buyer.

    know of a solution for the problem. At this stage, as the need or pain is recognized
    but unsatisfied, there is potential for a solution sale between the buyer and
    the right seller. If the buyer believes that there is a potential solution, they
    will actively seek a solution, and the need becomes an active need. However, if
    the buyer does not think that there is a solution to their problem, the need can
    become suppressed and go back to Level 1 as a latent need.

    and has a well-developed vision that includes four components —who will be taking
    what action, when will it be taken, via which capability of a seller's product
    or service.

    buyer understands the potential for a solution, but those needs have not yet been
    acted upon by a seller, and so they are "undeveloped needs". If, at this stage,
    the seller thrusts their vision on the buyer, a suboptimal situation arises with
    the buyer having to trust the seller to solve their problem. It is therefore very
    important for the seller to get the buyer to admit their pain at this stage. This
    is proof to the seller that the buyer views them as trustworthy and has the ability
    to provide the right solution.

    interest in the solution by first understanding the customer''s problems that
    they are trying to solve. To develop a win-win relationship with your customer,
    you must understand what it means for them to win, or in other words, what a successful
    solution means to them. Follow the "principles of empathetic communication" by
    outlining the objectives in terms of the customer''s needs and wants. This allows

    needs and benefits, the seller''s message should be stated as "you need….". The
    seller should not assume that the buyer already is aware about what value their

    features the buyer was interested in, and focused the demo only on those solution
    components.

    could request a proof of concept after the solution vision has been developed.
    Also, the seller can avoid having to discuss any specific pricing questions that
    may come up during the demo. Until the customer buys into the solution vision,
    it is better for the seller to avoid detailed pricing discussions, and instead
    stay at a rough order of magnitude level. When the customer sees the solution
    vision and the value of the solution, pricing negotiations can be much smoother,
    and you can avoid any unnecessary acrimony.

    in solution selling, where you methodically diagnose the customer's requirements,
    and in concert with the buyer, you build the solution blueprint, which will, of
    course, be biased towards your solution. Also, in using this approach, you will
    develop a solution selling benefit statement that is a composite statement of
    the features, advantages, and benefits of the solution. This is not to say that
    the customer will jump into a requirements assessment stage without even knowing
    the solution that the seller is offering. This is to differentiate between an
    early "vision" demo and a custom "proof" demo. The early vision demos are typically
    pre-scripted demos to articulate the solution capabilities, and help in articulating
    the solution features to build the solution vision for the buyer. When the buyer
    and seller reach the point where they share a joint vision, that's the stage for
    the proof demo. Proof demos can trigger time and resource constraints for the
    seller's organization, and hence should only be resorted to when there is a joint
    buyer-seller vision, which can be shown in the form of a solution selling benefit
    statement.

    addresses the vision that was developed through active participation by both the
    buyer and seller. As Bosworth puts it, the statement will indicate the prospect:
    *who will be doing what, when in time via a product or service*. So, in effect,
    the seller has corroborated with the buyer that there is a Level 3 need, meaning
    that the buyer has participated in the development of the solution vision. If
    the buyer is still at Level 2 or an earlier level, and the need or pain is still
    undeveloped or latent, the best that the seller can do is to develop an advantage
    statement. The **advantage statement** can list only the benefits from the eyes
    of the seller as they still don''t know the detailed pain points of the buyer.
    This is the fundamental difference between an advantage statement and the benefit
    statement that results from the solution selling approach.'

    the buyer acknowledges their pain, they progress to their next concern—cost.

    if there is a need associated with their solution. When the buyer achieves solution

    the buyer through the development of the solution vision. For example, Bosworth
    espouses a technique called the *9-Block Vision Processing Model*, where the seller
    moves the buyer from pain to vision through a series of questions that gradually
    build upon each other. As seen in the next diagram, sellers begin with **Open**
    questions—open-ended questions fashioned in a way to give the buyer a sense of
    control throughout the process. Open questions then lead to the **Control** questions
    that allow the seller to probe into specific subject matter areas. The final set
    of questions, the **Confirm** questions, lead to the summarization of the buyer's
    needs and pain, ensuring that the seller has a good understanding of the situation.
    The following is a depiction of Bosworth's 9-Block Vision Processing Model.

    to diagnose the customer's latent pain and get them to admit the pain. In the
    middle vertical block, the seller determines the organizational interdependencies,
    and the impact they have on the issues. The seller is able to determine which
    issues are more critical, and who are the power players or influencers for the
    requirements. The last vertical block helps the seller crystallize the solution
    selling benefits and vision by getting the buyer to take responsibility for solving
    their needs, preferably with a bias towards the seller's solution.

- en: While much of our discussion to this point has been about creating the vision
    as the seller is starting anew with the buyer, it is important to understand that
    these techniques also apply to situations where the buyer already has an initial
    vision in mind. This is a key point especially in the business solutions arena,
    where it is becoming commonplace for a solution provider to get engaged at the
    **Request for Proposal** (**RFP**) or **Request for Information** (**RFI**) stage.
    At this stage, the customer may have already engaged with an independent third-party
    consulting group to come up with their initial requirements. It is also possible
    that they could have engaged with a competitor for this. Obviously, the latter
    situation is not ideal as the requirements are already fashioned with a bias towards
    the competitor's solution, and the seller needs to do some investigation to ascertain
    that it is indeed still fair competition at that point. Keep in mind that if the
    buyer is merely going through the exercise to show their management that they
    completed the requisite steps for their due diligence by analyzing a preset number
    of solutions, it may be better for the seller to not waste too much of their time.
    But if it is still open competition, the seller can still use the same techniques
    offered here, including the 9-Block model, to "reengineer the vision".

    They are certainly worth investigating and forming your own opinions on how to

    solutions, and these are mission-critical systems to run the company's business.
    The sellers' responsibility then is to understand what the customers' needs are
    through a discovery process, and match the solution to their needs. The time span
    for the said discovery process can of course vary depending on where the customer
    is in their evaluation and buy cycle. But it doesn't absolve us from the need
    to follow a process for solution envisioning. The CEO/CFO/COO/CIO levels are the
    ultimate decision-makers—so you don't just go in and tell them how to run their
