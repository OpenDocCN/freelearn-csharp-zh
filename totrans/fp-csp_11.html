			<p>Congratulations on reaching the end of our journey into the world of functional programming in C#! Throughout this book, we’ve explored many concepts and techniques that are key to functional programming. Let’s review what we’ve learned and see what’s next for you as a <span class="No-Break">functional programmer.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-350"><a id="_idTextAnchor448"/>A summary of the main concepts and techniques</h1>
			<p>We started with the basics — expressions, statements, and understanding what makes a function “pure.” We learned how to write clear, easy-to-read code without <span class="No-Break">side effects.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we looked at handling errors in a functional way. We saw how using types such as <strong class="source-inline">Result</strong> and methods such as Railway Oriented Programming can help us write strong, error-resistant code without <span class="No-Break">using exceptions.</span></p>
			<p>We then moved on to higher-order functions and delegates. These tools let us treat functions as first-class citizens, which helps us write more abstract and <span class="No-Break">reusable code.</span></p>
			<p>We also covered functors and monads, breaking down these complex ideas to show how they can help manage complexity in <span class="No-Break">our programs.</span></p>
			<p>Recursion and tail calls were another important topic. We learned how to think about problems in a recursive way and how to optimize these <span class="No-Break">recursive functions.</span></p>
			<p>Currying and partial application taught us how to make more specialized functions from general ones, improving reusability <span class="No-Break">and composition.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, we put everything together with pipelines and function composition, learning how to chain functions to create clear, concise, and <span class="No-Break">maintainable code.</span></p>
			<p>Throughout this journey, we saw how each concept builds on the others. Functional programming is not just a set of techniques but a way of thinking that emphasizes clarity, safety, <span class="No-Break">and modularity.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-351"><a id="_idTextAnchor449"/>Comparison with other languages</h1>
			<p>While <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>C# has made great strides in supporting functional programming, it’s helpful to compare it to languages designed specifically for <span class="No-Break">this style.</span></p>
			<p>F#, part of the .NET family, offers a more natural functional experience with features such as immutable data structures, pattern matching, and <span class="No-Break">computation expressions.</span></p>
			<p>Haskell, a pure functional language, treats everything as an expression and ensures that functions are pure by default. It manages side effects strictly through monads, which can make it harder to learn, but it provides strong guarantees about <span class="No-Break">code behavior.</span></p>
			<p>Scala, like C#, blends object-oriented and functional programming. It has a more advanced type system, allowing for more abstract and general code, though this can <span class="No-Break">add complexity.</span></p>
			<p>C# stands out for its practicality. It lets you mix functional and object-oriented styles as needed, taking advantage of both approaches. While it may not be as purely functional as Haskell or as advanced in its type system as Scala, it offers a gentle introduction to functional programming within a <span class="No-Break">familiar context.</span></p>
			<p>Usually, the functional way of a developer starts with C#, transitions to F#, and ends with pure functional Haskell. After finishing this book, you may assume the first step into functional programming is done, and there are many new things <span class="No-Break">to learn.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-352"><a id="_idTextAnchor450"/>Resources for further learning</h1>
			<p>Your learning journey doesn’t end here. There’s always more to discover and master. The following are some resources to help you <span class="No-Break">continue learning.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-353"><a id="_idTextAnchor451"/>Closing thoughts</h1>
			<p>Functional programming changes how we think about and write code. By using concepts such as pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions, we can create software that is more reliable, expressive, and scalable. Thank you for having this journey and may functional programming be <span class="No-Break">with you!</span></p>
