    is then calculated as the reciprocal of `deltaTime`, providing an accurate measure
    of frames per second. Finally, the `frameRateText.text` property is updated with
    the calculated FPS value, rounded up to the nearest whole number using `Mathf.Ceil`.

- en: Reducing the impact of garbage collection is a critical optimization strategy
    for enhancing performance in Unity games. Although necessary for managing memory,
    excessive garbage collection can lead to significant performance issues, such
    as frame rate drops and stuttering. These issues occur because garbage collection
    temporarily halts the execution of your game to reclaim unused memory, which can
    disrupt the smooth flow of gameplay. Frequent interruptions by the garbage collector
    can cause noticeable pauses, leading to a less responsive and more frustrating
    experience for players.
  prefs: []

    of garbage collection, starting with identifying common sources of memory waste.
    Unnecessary allocations within frequently executed methods such as `Update()`
    are often culprits of performance issues. We’ll delve into best practices for
    avoiding these unwanted allocations and highlight the role of object pooling.
    Object pooling is especially effective for managing objects that are created and
    destroyed frequently, such as projectiles in a game or dynamic UI elements. By
    reusing objects instead of constantly generating new ones, developers can significantly
    reduce the load on garbage collection, leading to smoother gameplay and improved
    resource management.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Garbage collection in Unity is an automatic process that frees up memory by
    removing objects that are no longer in use. However, frequent garbage collection
    can lead to performance hiccups. To minimize its impact, avoid creating temporary
    objects in frequently called methods such as `Update()`. Instead, reuse objects
    through techniques such as object pooling. For instance, instead of instantiating
    new projectiles, create a pool of reusable projectiles at the start and activate
    them as needed, reducing the overhead on the garbage collector and improving performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Unity, managing garbage collection effectively is important for maintaining
    smooth game performance, especially in projects where real-time interactions and
    fluid dynamics are key. One common source of performance degradation is the excessive
    creation of temporary objects in methods that are called frequently, such as `Update()`.
    Every time a new object is created in these methods, it adds to the heap, increasing
    the workload for the garbage collector, which can lead to frame rate issues and
    gameplay stutter.

    their games to see where the most allocations are occurring. Unity’s Profiler
    tool is invaluable here, allowing you to monitor memory allocations frame by frame.

    frame in the `Update()` method is causing significant garbage.
