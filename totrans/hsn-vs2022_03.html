		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Chapter 2: Configuring the IDE</h1>
			<p>In general, it is common for software developers to have different tastes in writing code. This also applies in the configuration part of the tool you use to develop, such as whether you want to change the general color of the IDE or prefer to change the default font to one that suits you better.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn about the different configuration options in Visual Studio, which can certainly help you improve your productivity by having the exact elements you need, both in terms of colors and the location of windows that you frequently use.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to modify the IDE color scheme, configure dockable windows, and customize fonts.</p>
			<p>You will learn about the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Synchronizing accounts and settings </li>
				<li>Configuring the color scheme</li>
				<li>Customizing fonts</li>
				<li>Customizing the menu and toolbars</li>
				<li>Customizing panels</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>For this chapter, you will need to have Visual Studio 2022 already installed on your machine. In <a href="B17873_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Visual Studio 2022</em>, you can check the requirements and the installation process. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Synchronizing accounts and settings </h1>
			<p>A great feature of Visual <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>Studio is that it allows you to synchronize the configurations <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>you make, and also allows you to comfortably work on different computers.</p>
			<p>This is possible thanks to a Microsoft account, which is required for the use of Visual Studio. This account is requested when you start Visual Studio for the first time, or you can enter the account or modify it for use in Visual Studio at any time by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Sign in</strong> option, located at the top right of the IDE, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.1</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.1_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Visual Studio – Sign in (at the top right of the main screen)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – Visual Studio – Sign in (at the top right of the main screen)</p>
			<p>The main configurations that are synchronized through this process are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>User-defined window layout configurations</li>
				<li>Themes and menu settings</li>
				<li>Fonts and colors</li>
				<li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
				<li>Text editor settings</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you do not want to apply the synchronization of your configuration on a particular computer, it is possible to do so by going to the <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> | <strong class="bold">Options</strong> | <strong class="bold">Environment</strong> | <strong class="bold">Accounts</strong> menu. From here, you will be able to deselect the <strong class="bold">Synchronize Visual Studio settings across devices</strong> option, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.2</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.2_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Disable the synchronization of preferences between devices &#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Disable the synchronization of preferences between devices</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note </p>
			<p class="callout">Disabling this feature will not affect the synchronization process of other versions or editions of Visual Studio that may be installed on the same computer.</p>
			<p>Now that we have <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>learned about synchronizing settings between devices, let's look at <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>how to customize the main settings.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Configuring the color scheme</h1>
			<p>There are different ways to <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>customize Visual Studio 2022, one of the most important of which is to adjust colors.</p>
			<p>Whether you're in a well-lit space or coming from another programming environment, you'll probably want to adjust colors according to your personal preferences.</p>
			<p>To customize the <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>color scheme in Visual Studio 2022 to our liking, there are two things we can use:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Visual Studio default Themes</li>
				<li>Visual Studio Color Theme Designer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's analyze these options and learn how to apply the color scheme that best suits you.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Visual Studio default Themes</h2>
			<p>The first time <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>you start <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>Visual Studio 2022, you will be presented with a window, which will ask you about development settings, and a color theme, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.3</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.3_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – Selecting the initial theme &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – Selecting the initial theme</p>
			<p>These color themes are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Blue</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Blue (Extra Contrast)</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dark</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Light</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use system setting</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each of these options has a set of pre-established colors that you will be able to preview using the same window.</p>
			<p>Once you select the theme of your choice, it will be applied and saved in the configuration <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>that is associated with <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>the Microsoft account with which you have requested the license for the use of the IDE.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The <strong class="bold">Dark</strong> theme helps reduce eye strain in low-light conditions. This is a perfect option if you need to work for many hours per day in an office or places with limited light. <em class="italic">All the figures and screenshots will be in dark mode in this book</em>.</p>
			<p>In case you want to change the theme you selected at the beginning, you can do so by going to the main Visual Studio window and clicking on the link that says <strong class="bold">Continue without code</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.4_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – Accessing Visual Studio without code &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – Accessing Visual Studio without code</p>
			<p>Then, from the <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> dropdown menu, go to the <strong class="bold">Themes</strong> section; you will find all the default themes <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>and those that <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>you have previously installed. You only need to select one to apply the selected theme, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.5</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.5_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – Changing the Visual Studio theme &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – Changing the Visual Studio theme</p>
			<p>There is <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>another way to <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>change the theme. You can go to <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> | <strong class="bold">Options</strong> | <strong class="bold">Environment</strong> | <strong class="bold">General</strong> and choose <strong class="bold">Color Theme</strong>: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.6_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – Changing the color theme in the Options section &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – Changing the color theme in the Options section</p>
			<p>In this menu, you can also change how Visual Studio starts by selecting the different options <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>in the section <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>marked <strong class="bold">On startup, open</strong>. You can choose between the following options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Start window</strong>: The default window where you can select a recent project or create a new one (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.4</em>).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Most recent solution</strong>: Visual Studio will start with the last project or solution that was opened. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Empty environment</strong>: Open the main windows in Visual Studio without selecting a project or solution.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's now <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>review a fabulous <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>option to download additional themes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Visual Studio Marketplace</h2>
			<p>If the default <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>themes that are <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>part of the Visual Studio 2022 installation are not enough for you, you may want to look at the community-made themes hosted in Visual Studio Marketplace <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>that you can find at <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/</a>.</p>
			<p>Once you are in <strong class="bold">Marketplace</strong>, what you need to do is make a filter to show only the themes created by other developers, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.7</em>, which will display a series of very interesting options:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.7_B17873.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – Searching for themes in Visual Studio Marketplace </p>
			<p>If you want to know more about a specific theme, you need to click on the element, which will show you information about the theme, and almost always, an image of what the theme will look like once it is applied to Visual Studio will appear.</p>
			<p>If you want to install the theme, just click on the <strong class="bold">Download</strong> button, which will download the corresponding installer, and when you run it, it will start the installation process of the new theme.</p>
			<p>Once the <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>theme has been <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>installed, just follow the same steps as in the previous section to switch to the new theme.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Within the same Marketplace, there is a plugin called Visual Studio Theme Designer, which allows you to easily create your own themes.</p>
			<p>Now that we have seen how to select a theme that fits our visual preferences, let's see how we can customize the font styles as well.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Customizing fonts</h1>
			<p>There are two places <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>where you will probably be interested in changing the type of font you use:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the general environment</li>
				<li>In the source code editor</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's analyze each of the options as follows.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Changing fonts in the IDE</h2>
			<p>To change typography <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>at the IDE level, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>the <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> | <strong class="bold">Options</strong> menu.</li>
				<li>In the configuration window, go to the <strong class="bold">Environment</strong> | <strong class="bold">Fonts and Colors</strong> section. </li>
				<li>In this section, select the <strong class="bold">Environment</strong> option in the <strong class="bold">Show settings for</strong> drop-down list. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>This will allow you to change options such as font and size:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.8_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – Changing the environment font settings&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – Changing the environment font settings</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 2.8</em>, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>use the option <strong class="bold">Font</strong> to change the <strong class="bold">Automatic</strong> or <strong class="bold">Default</strong> font in <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>Visual Studio and see how it looks using the <strong class="bold">Sample</strong> section. </p>
			<p>Now let's review reference highlighting to see how to customize the way Visual Studio highlights text in the code.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Reference highlighting</h2>
			<p>Another common customization is to change the highlighting of references. This refers to highlighting <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>the different occurrences of a selected element, such as a variable or keyword. This can be best seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2.9</em>, in which, when positioned over the <code>int</code><strong class="bold"> </strong>keyword, all references to it are highlighted:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.9_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Reference highlighting&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – Reference highlighting</p>
			<p>If we want to change the color of the references found, we must perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to the <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> | <strong class="bold">Options</strong> menu.</li>
				<li>Select <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>the <strong class="bold">Fonts and Colors</strong> section.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Text Editor</strong> configuration.</li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Display items</strong> section, select the configuration called <strong class="bold">Highlighted Reference</strong> and change the corresponding colors, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.10</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.10_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10 – Changing the highlighted references options&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10 – Changing the highlighted references options</p>
			<p>You can choose the text <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>color in <strong class="bold">Item foreground</strong> and the backgound color in <strong class="bold">Item background</strong>, and finally see a preview of the color selected using the <strong class="bold">Sample</strong> section.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Changing fonts in the code editor</h2>
			<p>To make changes <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>to the typography used in the text editor, follow <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>the same steps shown just before <em class="italic">Figure 2.10</em>.</p>
			<p>As part of the configuration options, you can change the font used, the font color, the font size, and the background, among other attributes.</p>
			<p>One of the advantages of this configuration option is that it allows you to be as specific with the configuration as you need. This means that you can also alter the typography for things such as selected text, line numbers, bookmarks, and code snippets, among many other settings.</p>
			<p>Now that you <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>know how to change the typography to suit your needs, let's <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>see how to adjust the panels within the IDE so that your workflow will be faster according to your projects.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In Visual Studio 2022, the Cascadia font has been introduced as the default font, which has been described as a fun font with better code readability.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Customizing the menu bar and toolbars </h1>
			<p>Menus and toolbars are an excellent way to access tools or options, best known as commands, that you use frequently, so it is very important to learn how to customize them to help you in the development of your applications. In this section, we will learn the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Customizing the menu bar</li>
				<li>Customizing toolbars</li>
			</ul>
			<p>First, let's see how to customize the menu bar.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Customizing the menu bar</h2>
			<p>The menu bar is the <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>set of options that appear at the top of the IDE, which allow you to access a drop-down menu of options (such as the <strong class="bold">File</strong> menu) to execute a certain task, display tools, or apply a change to a project:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.11_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 – The default menu bar in Visual Studio 2022 &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11 – The default menu bar in Visual Studio 2022 </p>
			<p>If you want to change the tools that are part of the initial configuration, either to add options in a specific menu or to create your own menus, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Go to <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> | <strong class="bold">Customize</strong>.</li>
				<li>Go to the <strong class="bold">Commands</strong> section. </li>
				<li>In this section, you should work with the <strong class="bold">Menu bar</strong> option, which will allow you to modify a main <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>menu bar and a secondary menu bar, which you can differentiate with pipe symbols (|) in the dropdown, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2.12</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.12_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 – The Menu bar customization window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.12 – The Menu bar customization window</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Once you have selected the menu you wish to modify, a preview will appear, showing you <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>how the menu currently looks. From here, you can add new commands to the menu bar by clicking the <strong class="bold">Add Command</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This will open a new window that will show you each of the commands grouped by category, which you can select to add to the selected menu, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.13</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.13_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.13 – Changing the highlight references options&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.13 – Changing the highlight references options</p>
			<p>If you want to remove <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>the option added to the menu, just select it and click on the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button, which is highlighted by a rectangle in <em class="italic">Figure 2.14</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.14_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.14 – The button to delete an item from the menu bar&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.14 – The button to delete an item from the menu bar</p>
			<p>You also have <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>the <strong class="bold">Move Up</strong> and <strong class="bold">Move Down</strong> buttons, which allow you to move an option up or down on the menu and rearrange the menu items.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It is possible to delete toolbars created by the user but not those that are part of the default configuration.</p>
			<p>Finally, it is also possible to create new submenus or even a new menu. To do this, click on the <strong class="bold">Add New Menu</strong> button, which will add a new menu according to the hierarchical level you <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>are in. For example, if you want to add a main menu, you must select this option with the <strong class="bold">Menu Bar</strong> menu selected:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.15_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.15 – The configuration to add a new main menu&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.15 – The configuration to add a new main menu</p>
			<p>Conversely, if you want to add a submenu – for example, in the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> menu – you will have to carry <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>out this action having selected the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> menu:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.16_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.16 – The configuration to add a submenu in the Edit menu&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.16 – The configuration to add a submenu in the Edit menu</p>
			<p>The customization of toolbars is done in the same window; let's see how to do it next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Customizing toolbars</h2>
			<p>The toolbar is the set <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>of commands that you can access directly without the need to open a menu first, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.17</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.17_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.17 – The Visual Studio 2022 toolbar section&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.17 – The Visual Studio 2022 toolbar section</p>
			<p>It is also possible to configure which commands will appear in different tool groups by selecting <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> | <strong class="bold">Customize</strong>. In this window, we will see by default the tab called <strong class="bold">Toolbars</strong>, which will show us the different categories that we can select to show in the interface. By default, the <strong class="bold">Standard</strong> option is selected for API and web projects. Depending on the projects, there are other toolbars added by default, but we can add other toolbars manually, simply by selecting them with a tick, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.18</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.18_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.18 – The customization window for adding toolbars to the toolbar section&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.18 – The customization window for adding toolbars to the toolbar section</p>
			<p>You can add new commands to a toolbar by going to the <strong class="bold">Commands</strong> tab. In this tab, we will select the <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>toolbar we want to modify and carry out the same steps described in the <em class="italic">Customizing the menu bar</em> section.</p>
			<p>If you want to quickly add different toolbars to the IDE, <em class="italic">Figure 2.19</em> shows how to do it easily by accessing the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu and <strong class="bold">Toolbars</strong>, where you can select and deselect the toolbars you are interested in:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.19_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.19 – Access to the toolbars from the View menu&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.19 – Access to the toolbars from the View menu</p>
			<p>You now know how to add and remove toolbars in Visual Studio to customize the set tools depending on your <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>preferences or technologies you use. Next, let's review how to customize panels in Visual Studio. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Customizing panels</h1>
			<p>Panels in Visual Studio are <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>a way to access specific tools according to the type of project you are working on.</p>
			<p>These panels are composed of tools and document editors, some of which are used most of the time, such as the solution explorer (to see the structure of your projects), the toolbox (which shows you controls to drag and drop according to the current project), the properties panel (to modify the properties of the selected element), and the code editor.</p>
			<p>It is important that you know how to work with these panels so that you can configure the set of tools and editors that best suits your projects. That is why in this section, we will look at the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adding tools to panels</li>
				<li>Panel accommodation</li>
				<li>Working with documents</li>
				<li>Managing window layouts</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's learn how to configure <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>the IDE to show you the tools that you will need for your project.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Adding tools to panels</h2>
			<p>Visual Studio 2022 has <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>many tools or windows that you can show or hide <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>according to your needs. This list of tools can be found in the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu, as demonstrated in <em class="italic">Figure 2.20</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.20_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.20 – The list of available tools&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.20 – The list of available tools</p>
			<p>Once you have opened this menu, you will find the tools that are usually the most used listed immediately. These <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>tools include tools such as the server explorer, the <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>class viewer, the error listing, the output window, and the terminal, among other powerful tools.</p>
			<p>There is another set of tools that are not as widely used but may help you at some point. These are found in the <strong class="bold">Other Windows</strong> section.</p>
			<p>From here, you can access tools such as containers, C# interactive, Data Sources, and the Package Manager Console, among others.</p>
			<p>To add any of these tools to one of the panels, simply select one of them, and it will automatically be added to your <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>current environment in a strategic panel. For example, if you <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>add the <strong class="bold">Server Explorer</strong> tool, it will be added to the left panel. On the other hand, if you add the <strong class="bold">Output</strong> tool, it will be added to the bottom pane.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Panel accommodation</h2>
			<p>A great advantage of Visual <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>Studio is that you can arrange the tool panels wherever you prefer. To achieve the best results, it is convenient that you know the structure of a panel.</p>
			<p>Each panel is composed of five sections where you can place tools. These sections are located on each side of the panel, plus one in the center, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.21</em>: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.21_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 2.21 – The sections of a panel&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.21 – The sections of a panel</p>
			<p>To place a tool in a panel, simply position the cursor at the top of the tool and slide it to the panel you want. The IDE itself will show you the possible locations where you can place the tool, making the process simple and easy; you can also pull the panel out of the main windows and use it on its own. In <em class="italic">Figure 2.22</em>, you can see what the process of docking a window looks like:</p>

			<p>Now, it's time to <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>review how we can work with documents.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Working with documents</h2>
			<p>There are special options <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>that we can apply when working with document editors, such as the code editor. If we want to see these options, we just need to right-click on the tab of the open document, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.23</em>:</p>

			<p>These options are quite intuitive – for example, the <strong class="bold">Float</strong> option will allow us to turn the editor into a floating window, which we can drag to a second monitor. The <strong class="bold">Pin Tab</strong> option will allow us <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>to set the tab at the beginning of the open windows, and the <strong class="bold">Set Tab Layout</strong> option will allow us to move the set of tabs to the left, the top, or the right.</p>
			<p>It is important to highlight that if we have more documents open, we will have additional options available. With this option, we can create groups of documents to distribute the space and use it for performing tasks to increase productivity, such as comparing two documents. <em class="italic">Figure 2.24</em> demonstrates this visually:</p>

			<p>Now you know how to <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>manage your documents in the editor and organize them. Next, let's learn about managing window layouts. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Managing window layouts</h2>
			<p>It is very likely that <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>in your life as a developer, you will come across <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>projects of all kinds. You may have to manage things related to databases in a project, so you will probably want to keep the <strong class="bold">Server Explorer</strong> tool open. </p>
			<p>It may be that in another project you are working on at the same time, you don't have to touch anything related to databases and you want to keep the toolbox open.</p>
			<p>Is there any way to have tools located in the panels you prefer, without cluttering the IDE with tools? The answer is yes, thanks to the use of window layouts.</p>
			<p>Let's see the main tasks related to them.</p>
			<h3>Saving window layout</h3>
			<p>Once you have <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>configured your panels with the tools you require for a certain project, you need to go to the <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Save Window Layout</strong> menu.</p>
			<p>This will open a new window, which will prompt you for a name for your workspace configuration. Once you have entered the name, the configuration will be saved automatically.</p>
			<p>To verify that the change has been made, you can go to the <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage Window Layouts</strong> menu, which <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>will show you a window with all your previously saved layouts or workspaces.</p>
			<h3>Applying window layout</h3>
			<p>Once you have <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>saved at least one layout, you can apply it so that your workspace loads the panels with the tools, according to their arrangement at the time you saved the window layout.</p>
			<p>To apply a layout, you must go to the <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Apply Window Layout</strong> menu, which will show you all the previously saved layouts. Select the one you want to apply, and you will have your workspace loaded.</p>
			<h3>Resetting a window layout</h3>
			<p>Finally, you may want <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>to reverse all changes made to a workspace so that you have the initial Visual Studio configuration. Fortunately, this option is available by going to the <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Reset Window Layout</strong> menu.</p>
			<p>When we press this button, we will be asked whether we agree to return to the initial configuration. We just need to click on <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> to have the environment with the default configuration.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you have learned how to customize Visual Studio, choosing a theme, fonts, colors, and panels. Depending on your needs, you can not only set up your Visual Studio preferences but also try default configuration settings first, and adjust Visual Studio according to your work style.</p>
