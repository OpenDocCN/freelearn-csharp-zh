In 2005, Intel introduced its first multiple-core CPU, and since then, computers started developing in a different direction. Low-power consumption and a number of computing cores became more important than a row computing core performance. This lead to programming paradigm changes as well. Now, we need to learn how to use all CPU cores effectively to achieve the best performance, and at the same time, we need to save battery power by running only the programs that we need at a particular time. Besides that, we need to program server applications in a way to use multiple CPU cores or even multiple computers as efficiently as possible to support as many users as we can.</p><p>To be able to create such applications, you have to learn to use multiple CPU cores in your programs effectively. If you use the Microsoft .NET development platform and C#, this book will be a perfect starting point for you to program fast and responsive applications.</p><p>The purpose of this book is to provide you with a step-by-step guide for multithreading and parallel programming in C#. We will start with the basic concepts, going through more and more advanced topics based on the information from previous chapters, and we will end with real-world parallel programming patterns, Universal Windows applications, and cross-platform applications samples.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Threading Basics">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Threading Basics</em></span>, introduces the basic operations with threads in C#. It explains what a thread is, the pros and cons of using threads, and other important thread aspects.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Thread Synchronization">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Thread Synchronization</em></span>, describes thread interaction details. You will learn why we need to coordinate threads together and the different ways of organizing thread coordination.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Using a Thread Pool">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using a Thread Pool</em></span>, explains the thread pool concept. It shows how to use a thread pool, how to work with asynchronous operations, and the good and bad practices of using a thread pool.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Using the Task Parallel Library">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using the Task Parallel Library</em></span>, is a deep dive into the Task Parallel Library (TPL) framework.

You will find out what the <code class="literal">async</code> and <code class="literal">await</code> keywords mean, how to use them in different scenarios, and how <code class="literal">await</code> works under the hood.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Using Concurrent Collections">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Concurrent Collections</em></span>, describes the standard data structures for parallel algorithms included in .NET Framework. It goes through sample programming scenarios for each data structure.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Using PLINQ">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using PLINQ</em></span>, is a deep dive into the Parallel LINQ infrastructure. The chapter describes task and data parallelism, parallelizing a LINQ query, tweaking parallelism options, partitioning a query, and aggregating the parallel query result.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Reactive Extensions">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Reactive Extensions</em></span>, explains how and when to use the Reactive Extensions framework. You will learn how to compose events and how to perform a LINQ query against an event sequence.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Using Asynchronous I/O">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Asynchronous I/O</em></span>, covers in detail the asynchronous I/O process, including files, networks, and database scenarios.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Parallel Programming Patterns">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Parallel Programming Patterns</em></span>, outlines the solutions to common parallel programming problems.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. There's More">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>There's More</em></span>, covers the aspects of programming asynchronous applications for Windows 10, OS X, and Linux. You will learn how to work with Windows 10 asynchronous APIs and how to perform the background work in Universal Windows applications. Also, you will get familiar with cross-platform .NET development tools and components.</p></div></div>
