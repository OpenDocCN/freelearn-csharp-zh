    period of time. Dynamics NAV allows you to create budgets for fixed assets, items,
    sales and purchases, and projects. But we will focus on general ledger budgets
    in this section.

    the same time periods, simple or complex budgets by selecting combinations of
    G/L accounts, periods, and dimensions. You can also copy budgets from previous
    periods or create your budgets outside the application, with Excel, and then import
    it into Dynamics NAV.
