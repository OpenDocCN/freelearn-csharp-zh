- en: In this chapter, you will learn about game engines and look at four different
    types before focusing on Unity. Once that foundation is set, we will start taking
    a deep look at Unity's beginnings, where the game engine is today, and how it
    has progressed to being one of the top game engines in use today. We will highlight
    Unity's capabilities and features. We will then review the system requirements
    for developing Unity as well as running, Unity games. Finally, we will download
    and install Unity.

- en: The basic concept of game engines is that they provide a powerful set of tools
    to handle much of the grunt work of game development, allowing developers to focus
    on game aesthetics and gameplay. In the early days of video games, each game was
    coded from scratch without a game engine's libraries or capabilities. Instead
    of reinventing the wheel for each game, game engines started to emerge, making
    it easier for game studios to churn out games.

- en: Game engines are not general-purpose software suites that can create any game
    imaginable. They are highly specialized and, although very flexible, are intended
    for a specific range of game genres. For example, the Ego Game Technology Engine
    by Codemasters is used primarily for creating racing games; Pyrogenesis, by Wildfire
    Games, is used for creating **real-time-strategy** (**RTS**) games; the Silent
    Storm Engine, by Nival Interactive, is used predominately for turn-base tactics
    games; and ONScripter, by Naomi Takahashi, is used for creating visual novels
    and first-person adventure games.

    are open source, and others are proprietary. Selecting the right game engine for
    your game project is a critical pre-development step. Not every game engine will
    work for your game, and no single game engine will work for every game. Fortunately,
    we have a lot of options available to us.

    vehicle games, fighting, strategy, war, simulation, and puzzle. The difficulty
    in identifying a particular game's genre lies in the multiple ways in which game
    genres are classified. For example, you can have a TPS game that is also a **massively
    multiplayer online game** (**MMOG**) and, because it has a large number of puzzles,
    it can be added to the puzzle genre.

    you might wonder why you should select Unity. The first release in 2005 introduced
    us to an excellent game engine that has been continually improved upon over the
    last decade with new features, support, and enhancements. With each new release,
    developers are presented with more functionality to help them develop stunning
    games.

    is a game changer. Individuals, hobbyists, and small studios can make games using
    the same powerful game engine as large studios. In addition, the robust feature
    set and Unity community are additional factors that make Unity the right choice
    for your game development projects.
