We will cover the following subjects:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Downloading, installing, and setting up Unity</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Buying and installing Playmaker using the Asset Store</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating a new project and changing project settings</li></ul></div><p>If you are familiar with the process of downloading and installing Unity and plugins for it, you can move to the section of this chapter called <span class="emphasis"><em>Setting up your project</em></span>. It shows the layout of Unity and project settings that are going to be used for examples in this book.</p><div class="section" title="Downloading and installing Unity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>Downloading and installing Unity</h1></div></div></div><p>Unity<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/> is available for both Mac OS X and Windows PC, and the process of installation for these platforms is very similar. This book is going to use the Mac version of Unity, but I will provide you with alternative directions and hotkeys when they are different in the Windows version. Luckily, everything is, in fact, quite similar, and you should not have any problems switching between the two platforms if you choose to do so.</p><p>First things first, let us head over <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>to <a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/unity/download/">http://unity3d.com/unity/download/</a> and download the <a id="id2" class="indexterm"/>latest version of Unity available (as of writing this book the version is 4.3). Just click the blue <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button, and the file should start being downloaded to your hard drive. The file in question will be a DMG file for Mac users or an installer EXE for Windows users. Save it wherever you want on your hard drive.</p><p>If you are on a Mac, double-clicking the DMG file will reveal the PKG file, which is the installer. Double-clicking <code class="literal">Unity.pkg</code> <a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>will produce essentially the same result as double-clicking <code class="literal">Unity.exe</code> in <a id="id4" class="indexterm"/>Windows—it will prompt the installation wizard. You are not given any Unity-specific <a id="id5" class="indexterm"/>options<a id="id6" class="indexterm"/> except for the location where you want to install the engine.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>You can install multiple versions of Unity on the same computer. To do this, you just have to change the name of the folder in which Unity is being installed and put the new installation into a different folder. You might want to do this if you want to have different versions installed at the same time, either because of license restrictions or because of some version-specific features that you want to access. Keep in mind that if you update a project to a newer version of Unity, you cannot go back to an older one.</p></div></div><p>The following screenshot shows the installation window of Unity. In this stage of the wizard you can specify the directory where Unity will be installed or change some installation parameters. In most cases you will want to install Unity with the default parameters. If that is the case, simply click on <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> and skip the next step.</p><p>If you want to change the install location, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Change Install Location...</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Customize</strong></span> button lets you include or exclude specific packages, such as the main Unity installation, example project, and Unity Web Player. Leave all of the boxes checked for this installation. We will talk about packages later in the book.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_01.jpg" alt="Downloading and installing Unity"/></div><p>Clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> will lead to installation of Unity on your hard drive. Once installation is done, you can go to the folder where you installed it (by default, <code class="literal">Applications/Unity</code> on Mac or <code class="literal">C:\\Program Files\Unity</code> in Windows) and launch it.</p><p>If you are<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/> launching<a id="id8" class="indexterm"/> Unity for the first time, a window will pop up asking you to select your type of license and enter your Unity account login and password. Do create an account if you do not have one and enter the details. Later you will need it for things like forum access and Unity answers—both very helpful when you are looking for solutions to Unity-related problems. In this book we are going to be using the free version of Unity, since none of the examples here will require any pro-license features. So select <span class="strong"><strong>Activate the free version of Unity</strong></span> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_02.jpg" alt="Downloading and installing Unity"/></div><p>The first time you open Unity, a default project will likely be loaded. These test projects included with the installation (and available through Unity's website) will be quite helpful later on when you want to find out how to do some specific thing (for example, mini-map or water physics), but do not know where to start.</p><p>For now, though, we want a new empty project. Once Unity is loaded, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu in the main menu on the top-left corner of the screen and select <span class="strong"><strong>New Project…</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_03.jpg" alt="Downloading and installing Unity"/></div><p>This will prompt the <a id="id9" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Project Wizard</strong></span> window, in which you can choose where you want your future project to be <a id="id10" class="indexterm"/>located, as well as how it will be called. In Unity, a project is a folder, so the name that you give to your project folder will automatically be assigned to the project. For the examples in this book, you will not need any packages at this point, so leave all the checkboxes empty, unless you already have Playmaker downloaded, in which case check Playmaker. When you are ready, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Create Project</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"/>Tip</h3><p>If you want to always start from the <span class="strong"><strong>Project Wizard</strong></span> (which is highly recommended if you are planning to have multiple projects), go to <span class="strong"><strong>Unity</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> and check <span class="strong"><strong>Always Show Project Wizard</strong></span>, then close the <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> window. For Windows users it is <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> instead.</p></div></div><p>Since we are not loading any heavy asset packages, the project will load really quickly, and you should see the main Unity interface again, except this time everything will be empty.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_04.jpg" alt="Downloading and installing Unity"/></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Buying and importing Playmaker"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Buying and importing Playmaker</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we change anything in the layout of our project, there is one missing component that we have to import, which is <a id="id11" class="indexterm"/>Playmaker by Hutong Games<a id="id12" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.hutonggames.com/">http://www.hutonggames.com/</a>)—the main tool (apart from Unity itself) that we are going to be using in most of the exercises in this book. To get Playmaker, we are going to use the Asset Store. The latter is an online market place valuable for any Unity developer, allowing us to save a lot of time by importing useful plugins and asset packs made by other users into our own projects. Some of the assets available through the Asset Store are free, but most of them, like Playmaker, are user-made and cost money. You too can make your tools and assets available through the Asset Store. Think of it as a developer-targeted analogue of the iTunes Store or Amazon.</p><p>Although you can access and search the Asset Store<a id="id13" class="indexterm"/> through a web page (<a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/asset-store/">http://unity3d.com/asset-store/</a>), it is integrated directly into the engine in its most practical form. To access the <a id="id14" class="indexterm"/>Asset Store directly from Unity, go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> submenu in the main menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> from the list. This will open the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> window in Unity (you need to be connected to the Internet to see the content of the store).</p><p>In the top-right corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> window, there is a search box. Type <code class="literal">Playmaker</code> in there and press <span class="emphasis"><em>return</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>) on your keyboard. When the search results are displayed, click on the first one in the top-left corner of <span class="strong"><strong>Search Results</strong></span>, simply called <span class="strong"><strong>Playmaker,</strong></span> as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_05.jpg" alt="Buying and importing Playmaker"/></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Asset Store</strong></span> window will <a id="id15" class="indexterm"/>now display the description of Playmaker, user comments, some <a id="id16" class="indexterm"/>screenshots, its price, and the <span class="strong"><strong>Buy</strong></span> button. Click on this <a id="id17" class="indexterm"/>button, enter your credit card or PayPal details, and complete the purchase as you would do with any other online store or service. After that Unity will offer to import the package. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> button and when Playmaker is downloaded, in the import window, leaving all the boxes checked, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> again. This will add the Playmaker files to your new Unity project.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"/>Tip</h3><p>Another way of installing Playmaker (or any other plugin for that matter) is going to <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import Package</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Custom Package...</strong></span>, provided that you already have the <code class="literal">unitypackage</code> file with it on your hard drive.</p></div></div><p>Playmaker also automatically imports some other popular Unity plugins it depends on: iTween for movement and animation and Photon for networking and multiplayer. We will talk about Photon later in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Networking and Multiplayer">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Networking and Multiplayer</em></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_06.jpg" alt="Buying and importing Playmaker"/></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Setting up your project"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Setting up your project</h1></div></div></div><p>There is an important thing that<a id="id18" class="indexterm"/> you have to know about Unity: you can customize it in many different ways and even expand its interface with your own custom windows and panels. We are not going to discuss this just yet, as the user interface is examined in more detail in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Unity's and Playmaker's User Interface">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity's and Playmaker's</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>User Interface</em></span>, but you should know that there is nothing to be surprised about if the user interface changes when you install a new extension, such as Playmaker. You can also drag different tabs around and see which layout fits your screen size/configuration and project best. Now we are going to set up the interface in a way that will simplify the explanations in the next couple of chapters. Once you are comfortable with the interface, you can feel free to customize it however you want.</p><p>If you haven't dragged anything around, you should be seeing the default Unity layout. If you have, go to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Layouts</strong></span> in the main menu and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Default</strong></span> in order to reset to the default window layout. You will see a tab called <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> on the left, <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> in the middle, <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> on the right, and <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> on the bottom. We will talk more about these tabs and their functions in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Unity's and Playmaker's User Interface">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity's and Playmaker's</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>User Interface</em></span>. Right now, in order to save screen space, we will drag some of them around and change their appearance.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the <a id="id19" class="indexterm"/>default interface layout<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/> in Unity.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_07.jpg" alt="Setting up your project"/></div><p>Let us start with the<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/> Project tab that you can see on the bottom of the screen. If it is not highlighted, click on the word <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span>. Right now both <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tabs are pinned to the bottom of the screen, so you can switch between them in order to select one or the other. Unfortunately, this layout is not ideal, as in most cases you will need direct access to both <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tabs at the same time. Click and drag the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab to the right of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> tabs, until it snaps into place next to the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> tab. It will become tall and narrow.</p><p>Unfortunately, now there's very little space in the Project panel with those large icons. Luckily, Unity allows us to solve this problem easily by clicking on the small options icon (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_08.jpg" alt="Setting up your project"/></span>) in the top-right corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>One Column Layout</strong></span> from the list.</p><p>Now your <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel will need much less space, and you will be able to see all of your project's file structure without getting frustrated over icons and sub-panels getting in your way.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"/>Tip</h3><p>It is important to note here that some developers do prefer the <span class="strong"><strong>Two Column Layout</strong></span> for its <span class="strong"><strong>Favorites</strong></span> section and file manager-like subfolder representation; however, you will most likely want to have as much free work space as you can get, especially when working with plugins like Playmaker that add additional tabs that you need to have constant access to. You should consider the <span class="strong"><strong>Two Column Layout</strong></span> only if you have a relatively big screen.</p></div></div><p>Now that the <a id="id22" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel is set up and in place, let us free some more space for the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel by moving the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> panel under <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span>. To do this, click and drag the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> tab as you did with the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> tab, and move it to the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> panels until it snaps into place directly under them.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_09.jpg" alt="Setting up your project"/></div><p>The following screenshot shows what your editor window should look like if you followed all of the instructions in this chapter correctly.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_10.jpg" alt="Setting up your project"/></div><p>Finally, your work <a id="id23" class="indexterm"/>space is all set! Now it is time to change the project settings. It is a good idea to do this before you start working in order to get this out of the way, so let us get to it. We will not go into much detail about why certain project settings are set in a certain way, and most of them are quite self-explanatory.</p><p>First, select <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Player</strong></span> from the main menu. A new menu should appear in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel on the right. You can put your name or the name of your company in the <span class="strong"><strong>Company Name</strong></span> field near the top of the menu, and <span class="strong"><strong>Product Name</strong></span> (just below it) by default should be the same as the name of your project folder that you specified while creating the project. Changing the project name will not rename your project folder. In fact, everything you change in the Player settings only affects the output game or application. We are going to be building a Unity WebPlayer project for this book's examples, so click on the tab with a little planet icon (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_11.jpg" alt="Setting up your project"/></span>).</p><p>There are only two things here that we are interested in right now: screen resolution and WebPlayer template. Make sure that the <span class="strong"><strong>Default Screen Width</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Height</strong></span> are set to <code class="literal">960</code> and <code class="literal">600,</code> respectively, and the active template is <span class="strong"><strong>No Context Menu</strong></span>. There are more options here, but we are going to leave them at their default values for now.</p><p>Next, we will change the build settings to match our target platform. Go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings…</strong></span> and select <span class="strong"><strong>WebPlayer</strong></span> from the list of available platforms (it should be the topmost item on the list). Then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Switch Platform</strong></span> button (as shown in the following screenshot). This will allow you to test the game directly with the output resolution. Once Unity finishes reimporting files, you can close the <span class="strong"><strong>Build Settings</strong></span> window.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_01_12.jpg" alt="Setting up your project"/></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec12"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter you learned how to download and install Unity, purchase and install plugins for it from the Asset Store, prepare your project for work, optimize your workspace, and select the output platform. In the next chapter, we will look at Unity's interface in more detail. In particular, we will examine various panels and views (for example, <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span>) that you have encountered in this chapter and start using them.</p></div></body></html>
