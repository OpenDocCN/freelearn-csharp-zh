<p>Network programming is a complex undertaking, with the potential for an extremely high impact on the performance and scalability of the software it supports. Learning to leverage the high-level language constructs and features of C# and the .NET Core libraries can help engineers to fine-tune their network applications to the performance modern users have come to expect. This book is written to serve as a comprehensive exploration of the concepts of network programming, as viewed through the lens of the .NET Core framework. It seeks to explain every aspect of computer networks, and the software that makes those networks possible. Using little more than the .NET Core SDK and a code editor, the contents of this book demonstrate how to implement flexible, stable, and reliable software to facilitate large-scale computer networking.</p>

<p>If you have any experience with object-oriented programming languages, and would like to learn more about how C# and .NET Core can facilitate network and web programming, this book is for you. Additionally, if you administer or manage network resources and would like to develop the skills to manage or customize your network with the tools available in .NET Core, this book is an excellent resource. And finally, if you have any experience with network programming, but would like to take a closer look at the .NET Core framework, this is the book for you.</p>
