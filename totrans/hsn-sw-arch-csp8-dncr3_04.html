                    <h1 class="header-title">Documenting Requirements with Azure DevOps</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Azure DevOps is the evolution of Visual Studio Team Services and there is a variety of new features that can help developers to document and organize their software. The purpose of this chapter is to present an overview of this tool provided by Microsoft.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating an Azure DevOps project using your Azure account</li>
<li>Understanding the functionalities offered by Azure DevOps</li>
<li>Organizing and managing requirements using Azure DevOps</li>
<li>Presenting use cases in Azure DevOps</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Technical requirements</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This chapter requires you to create a new free Azure account or use an existing one. The <em>Creating an Azure account</em> section of <a href="14b5c5da-4042-439e-9e5a-2e19ba4c4930.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture</em>, explains how to create one. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Introducing Azure DevOps</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Azure DevOps is a Microsoft <strong>Software as a S</strong><strong>ervice</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>) platform that enables you to deliver continuous value to your customers. By creating an account there, you will be able to easily plan your project, store your code safely, test it, publish the solution to a staging environment, and then publish the solution to the actual production infrastructure.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Of course, Azure DevOps is a complete framework and the ecosystem that it provides for<br/>
software development is currently available. The automation of all the steps involved in software production ensures the continuous enhancement and improvement of an existing solution in order to adapt it to market needs. </p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You can start the process moving in your Azure portal. If you don't know how to create an Azure portal account, then please check <a href="14b5c5da-4042-439e-9e5a-2e19ba4c4930.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture</em>. The steps to create an Azure DevOps account are quite simple:</p>
<ol>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Select Create a resource and then DevOps Project:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/0bb2e952-9c3d-4ec9-a014-b2ac7f3b9dc4.png" style="width:56.42em;height:49.25em;"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>As soon as you start the wizard for creating the project, you can choose how you want to deliver your system from several different platforms. This is one of the greatest advantages of Azure DevOps as you are not limited to Microsoft tools and products, but you can from all common platforms, tools, and products available on the market:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/88a26d74-f288-44f3-b0a9-d3d0a371f961.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="3">
<li>The options available will depend on the platform chosen in the first step. In some cases, you can choose from several deployment options, as you can see in the following screenshot, which appears if you select the .NET platform:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/76e11a43-9b8e-4a88-8895-6950366f7ac7.png"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Once the setup is complete, you will be able to manage the project using the project portal according to the information you provided. It is worth mentioning that this wizard will create an Azure DevOps Service if you do not have one. The Azure DevOps organization is where you can organize all of you<br/>
Azure DevOps projects. The whole process takes less than 20 minutes:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d23628fd-50d5-415b-8e82-7e5cda97f824.png" style="width:38.17em;height:37.17em;"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>After that, you will be able to start planning your project. The following screenshot shows the page that appears once the Azure DevOps project creation is complete. In the remainder of this book, we will come back to this page several times to introduce and describe various useful features that ensure a faster and efficacious deployment:</li>

<p>As you can see from the preceding screenshot, the process for creating an Azure DevOps account and starting to develop the best-in-class DevOps tool is quite simple. It is worth mentioning that you can start using this fantastic tool at no cost, considering you have up to five developers on your team, plus any number of stakeholders.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Organizing your work using Azure DevOps</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>DevOps is a <strong>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment</strong> (<strong>CI/CD</strong>) methodology, that is, a set of best practices on how to apply continuous improvements to a software application and how to deliver them to the production environment. Azure DevOps is a powerful tool whose range of applications encompasses all the steps involved in both the initial development of an application and in its subsequent CI/CD process.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Azure DevOps contains tools for collecting requirements and for organizing the whole development process. They can be accessed by clicking the Boards menu in the Azure DevOps page and will be described in more detail in the next two sections:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/aeaf61e6-9ec3-4739-836b-373b4b95bf2d.png" style="width:7.67em;height:17.17em;"/></p>
<p>All other functionalities available in Azure DevOps are briefly reviewed in the following subsections. They will be discussed in detail in <a href="c707cf13-3616-4788-8f39-687bd1cb7c7b.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, <em>Testing Your Code with Unit Test Cases and TDD</em>, to <a href="e61b3c5d-3abd-4442-9c9c-e12fd3acedcc.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>, <em>Automation for Software Testing</em>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Azure DevOps repository</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Repos menu item gives you access to a Git repository in order to place the project code:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/a9b2f212-5f28-4b8d-8df0-08bce2ef787b.png" style="width:7.67em;height:16.83em;"/></p>
<p>You can connect to this repository from inside Visual Studio in a very simple way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Visual Studio and ensure you are logged in to Visual Studio with the same Microsoft account used to define your DevOps project (or used to add you as a team member).</li>
<li>Prepare a Visual Studio solution containing the Visual Studio projects you need in your application (further projects can be added during development) if your DevOps project repository is empty.</li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Select the Team Explorer tab and then click the connection button:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/c0fca1ee-8026-4583-9dcc-8f1579360299.png" style="width:22.00em;height:18.50em;"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Clicking the Connect... link of Azure DevOps, you will be driven to connect with one of your Azure DevOps projects.</li>
<li>Click the Team Explorer Home button. Now, you will see commands for performing Git operations and for interaction with other Azure DevOps areas:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/53bda670-8b1f-4794-b35c-451cbbad6a7a.png" style="width:19.42em;height:12.25em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="6">
<li>Commit the solution you just created by clicking the Changes button if the Azure DevOps repository is empty and then following the subsequent instructions. </li>
<li>Click the Sync button to synchronize your local repository with the remote Azure DevOps repository. If the remote repository is empty and you just created a solution, this action will initialize the remote Azure DevOps repository with this solution; otherwise, this action will download the remote repository on your local machine.</li>
<li>Once all team members have initialized both their local machine repositories and the Azure DevOps repository with the preceding steps, it is enough to open Visual Studio. The solution created in your local repository will appear in the bottom area of the Team Explorer window.</li>
<li>Click the window to open the solution on your local machine. Then, synchronize with the remote repository to ensure the code you are modifying is up to date.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Team Explorer menu enables you to execute most Git commands, to launch remote builds (Builds button) and to interact with other Azure DevOps areas (see, for instance, the Work Items button).</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Package feeds</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Artifacts menu handles the software packages used by the project. There, you may define feeds for basically all types of packages such as NuGet, Node.js, and Python. Once in the Artifacts area, you may create several feeds by clicking the + New Feed link, where each feed can handle several kinds of packages:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/18d082aa-6eee-4b29-b31a-60f26dfc9696.png" style="width:26.33em;height:20.25em;"/></p>
<p>If you select the option to connect to packages from public sources, as a default, the feed connects to <kbd>npmjs</kbd>, <kbd>nuget.org</kbd>, and <kbd>pypi.org</kbd>. However, you can go to the upstream sources tab in the Feed settings section through the menu in the upper-right corner and remove/add package sources:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/9e8a421b-0634-4b20-99e4-679ef66afeae.png"/></p>
<p>The Connect to feed link of each feed shows a window that, for each package type, explains how to do the following things:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Upload private packages to the feed. This way each team can use its private package's code base.</li>
<li>Connect to the feed to use its packages from Visual Studio. You should add all the project feeds to your Visual Studio feeds in order to also use the private team packages uploaded in the feed; otherwise, your local build will file.</li>
<li>Manage credentials to access the feed:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/99c1a595-ddcf-42e3-8282-d14f45630f93.png" style="width:53.75em;height:33.50em;"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Test plans</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Test Plans section allows you to define the test plans you want to use and their settings. It can be accessed through the Test Plans menu item:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/6857dc53-f333-4cb4-8ab5-24251e039eba.png" style="width:8.33em;height:14.00em;"/></p>
<p>Here, you may define, execute, and track test plans made of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual acceptance tests</li>
<li>Automatic unit tests</li>
<li>Load tests</li>
</ul>
<p>Automatic unit tests must be defined in test projects contained in the Visual Studio solution and based on a framework such as NUnit, xUnit, and MSTest (Visual Studio has project templates for all of them). Test Plans gives you the opportunity to execute these tests on Azure and to define the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A number of configuration settings</li>
<li>When to execute them</li>
<li>How to track them and where to report their results in the overall project documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>For manual tests, you may define complete instructions for the operator, the environment in which to execute them (for example, an operating system), and where to report their results in the project documentation. You can also define how to execute load tests, how to measure results, and where to report them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Pipelines</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Pipelines are automatic action plans that specify all steps from the code build until the software deployment is in production. They can be defined in the pipelines area, which is accessible through the Pipelines menu item:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/8d574ea9-3e7c-424a-9c24-ff9e19182ba8.png" style="width:9.83em;height:13.58em;"/></p>
<p>There, you can define a complete pipeline of tasks to execute alongside their triggering events, which encompasses steps such as code building, launching test plans, and what to do after the tests are passed.</p>
<p>Typically, after the tests are passed, the application is automatically deployed in a staging area where it can be beta-tested. You can also define the criteria for the automatic deployment in production. Such criteria include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of days the application was beta-tested</li>
<li>Number of bugs found during beta-testing and/or removed by the last code change</li>
<li>Manual approval by one or more managers/team members</li>
</ul>
<p>The criteria decision will depend on the way the company wants to manage the product that is being developed. You, as a software architect, have to understand that when it comes to moving code to production, the safer, the better.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Managing system requirements in Azure DevOps</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Azure DevOps enables you to document system requirements using <em>work items</em>. Work items are stored in your project as a piece of information that can be assigned to a person. They are classified into various types and may contain a measure of the development effort required, a status, and the development stage (iteration) they belong to.</p>
<p>In fact, DevOps methodology, as an Agile methodology, is made of several iterations and the whole development process is organized as a set of sprints. The work items available depends on the <em>Working Item Process</em> you select while creating the Azure DevOps project. The following subsections contain a description of the most common work item types.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Epics work items</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Imagine you are developing a system made of various subsystems. Probably, you are not going to conclude the whole system in a single iteration. Therefore, we need an umbrella spanning several iterations to encapsulate all features of each subsystem. Each Epics work item represents one of these umbrellas that can contain several features to be implemented in various development iterations. </p>
<p>In the Epics work item, you can define the state and acceptance criteria as well as the start date and target date. Besides, you can also provide a priority and an effort estimate. All of this detailed information helps the stakeholders to follow the development process. This is really useful as a macro view of the project.</p>
<p>Epics are not available as a default. They must be enabled in the project's Team Settings page, which can be reached by clicking the project settings link in the bottom-left corner of the project page and then selecting Team Settings:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/360da6d1-2fd9-4b0d-8fe1-5a31f7cb33af.png"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Features work items</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>All of the information that you provide in an Epics work item can also be placed in a Features work item. So, the difference between these two types of work items is not related to the kind of information they contain, but to their roles and the focus; your team will get to conclude them. Epics may span several iterations and are hierarchically above Features, that is, each Epics work items is linked to several children Features, while each Features work items must be implemented in a single iteration and is part of a single Epics work items.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that all work items have sections for team discussions. There, you will be able to find a team member in the discussion area by typing the <kbd>@</kbd> character (like in several forum/social applications). Inside each work item, you can link and attach various information. You may also check the history of the current work item in a specific section.</p>
<p>Features work items are the places to start recording user requirements. For instance, you can write a Features work item called <strong>Access Control</strong> to define the complete functionally needed to implement the system access control.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Product Backlog items/User Story work items</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>After selecting the <em>Working Item Process</em>, you will know which of these two work items is available. There are minor differences between them, but their purpose is substantially the same. They contain detailed requirements for the Features, described by the Features work items they are connected to. More specifically, each Product Backlog/User Story work item specifies the requirements of a single functionality that is a part of the behavior described in its father Features work items. For instance, in a Features of system access control, the maintenance of the users and the login interface should be two different User Stories/Product Backlog items. These requirements will guide the creation of other children work items:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tasks</strong>: They are important work items that describe the job that needs to be done to meet the requirements stated in the father Product Backlog items/User Story work item. Task work items can contain time estimates that help team capacity management and overall scheduling.</li>
<li><strong>Test cases</strong>: These items describe how to test the functionality described by the requirements. </li>
</ul>
<p>The number of tasks and test cases you will create for each Product Backlog/User Story work item will vary according to the development and testing scenario you use.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Book use case – presenting use cases in Azure DevOps</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This section clarifies the concepts exposed in the previous section with the practical example of the wwtravelclub. Considering the scenario described in <a href="14b5c5da-4042-439e-9e5a-2e19ba4c4930.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture</em>, we decided to define three Epics work items, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/4ffaa42d-4b11-498c-92a9-eb0ea4c4547f.png"/></p>
<p>The creation of these work items is quite simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inside each work item, link the different types of work items, as you can see in the following screenshot.</li>
<li>It is really important to know that the connection between work items are really useful during software development. Hence, as a software architect, you have to provide this knowledge to your team and, more than that, you have to incentive them to make these connections:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/4b998f62-44ea-48a2-a493-54bbe32da6e4.png" style="width:20.33em;height:29.33em;"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>As soon as you create a Feature work item, you will be able to connect it to several Product Backlog work items that detail its specifications. The following screenshot shows the details of a Product Backlog work item:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/64a16342-99a5-4d09-8844-cf33fbbd41fc.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="4">
<li>After that, Task and Test Case work items can be created for each Product Backlog work item. The user interface provided by Azure DevOps is really efficacious because it enables you to track the chain of functionalities and the relations among them:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/fe92bd07-a172-4c78-a547-e22c363404bd.png" style="width:50.83em;height:31.83em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="5">
<li>As soon as you complete the input for the Product Backlog and Tasks work items, you will be able to plan the project sprints together with your team. The plan view enables you to drag and drop Product Backlog work items to each planned Sprint:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/af7d376f-1824-47cd-88d1-ce55c871c4e8.png"/></p>
<p>This is how these work items are created. Once you understand this mechanism, you will be able to create and plan any software project. It is worth mentioning that the tool itself will not solve problems related to team management. However, the tool is a great way to incentive the team to update the project status, so you can keep a clear vision of how the project is evolving.</p>

<p>This chapter covered how you can create an Azure DevOps account for a software development project, and how to start managing your projects with Azure DevOps. It also gave a short review of all Azure DevOps functionalities, explaining how to access them through the Azure DevOps main menu. This chapter described in more detail how to manage system requirements and how to organize the job with various kinds of work items, and how to plan and organize sprints that will deliver Epics solutions with many Features.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
