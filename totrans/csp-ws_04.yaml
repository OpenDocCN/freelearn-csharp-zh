    usage in C#. You will then see how Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) can be used
    to query collections in memory using code that is efficient and succinct. By the
    end of this chapter, you will be well versed in using LINQ for operations such
    as sorting, filtering, and aggregating data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout the previous chapters, you have used variables that refer to a single
    value, such as the `string` and `double` system types, system `class` instances,
    and your own class instances. .NET has a variety of data structures that can be
    used to store multiple values. These structures are generally referred to as collections.
    This chapter builds on this concept by introducing collection types from the `System.Collections.Generic`
    namespace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can create variables that can store multiple object references using collection
    types. Such collections include lists that resize to accommodate the number of
    elements and dictionaries that offer access to the elements using a unique key
    as an identifier. For example, you may need to store a list of international dialing
    codes using the codes as unique identifiers. In this case, you need to be certain
    that the same dialing code is not added to the collection twice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These collections are instantiated like any other classes and are used extensively
    in most applications. Choosing the correct type of collection depends primarily
    on how you intend to add items and the way you would like to access such items
    once they are in a collection. The commonly used collection types include `List`,
    `Set`, and `HashSet`, which you will cover in detail shortly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LINQ is a technology that offers an expressive and concise syntax for querying
    objects. Much of the complexities around filtering, sorting, and grouping objects
    can be removed using the SQL-like language, or if you prefer, a set of extension
    methods that can be chained together to produce collections that can be enumerated
    with ease.

- en: .NET provides various types of in-built data structures, such as the `Array`,
    `List`, and `Dictionary` types. At the heart of all data structures are the `IEnumerable`
    and `ICollection` interfaces. Classes that implement these interfaces offer a
    way to enumerate through the individual elements and to manipulate their items.
    There is rarely a need to create your own classes that derive directly from these
    interfaces, as all the required functionality is covered by the built-in collection
    types, but it is worth knowing the key properties as they are heavily used throughout
    .NET.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The generic version of each collection type requires a single type parameter,
    which defines the type of elements that can be added to a collection, using the
    standard `<T>` syntax of the generic types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `IEnumerable` interface has a single property, that is, `IEnumerator<T>
    GetEnumerator()`. This property returns a type that provides methods that allow
    the caller to iterate through the elements in the collection. You do not need
    to call the `GetEnumerator()` method directly, as the compiler will call it whenever
    you use a `foreach` statement, such as `foreach(var book in books)`. You will
    learn more about using this in the upcoming sections.

    can be implemented using `List`.

    when adding items to the end, but it may be inefficient when inserting items,

    need to be recalculated.

- en: In this exercise, you have seen how lists can be used to store multiple items
    of the same type while maintaining the order of items. The next section covers
    the `Queue` and `Stack` classes, which allow items to be added and removed in
    a predefined sequence.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Queue class provides a first-in, first-out mechanism. Items are added to
    the end of the queue using the `Enqueue` method and are removed from the front
    of the queue using the `Dequeue` method. Items in the queue cannot be accessed
    via an index element.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Queues are typically used when you need a workflow that ensures items are processed
    in the order in which they are added to the queue. A typical example might be
    a busy online ticketing system selling a limited number of concert tickets to
    customers. To ensure fairness, customers are added to a queuing system as soon
    as they log on. The system would then dequeue each customer and process each order,
    in full, either until all tickets have been sold or the customer queue is empty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The following example creates a queue containing five `CustomerOrder` records.
    When it is time to process the orders, each order is dequeued using the `TryDequeue`
    method, which will return `true` until all orders have been processed. The customer
    orders are processed in the order that they were added. If the number of tickets
    requested is more than or equal to the tickets remaining, then the customer is
    shown a success message. An apology message is shown if the number of tickets
    remaining is less than the requested amount.

  prefs:

- en: The `Stack` class provides the opposite mechanism to the `Queue` class; items
    are processed in last-in, first-out order. As with the `Queue` class, you cannot
    access elements via their index position. Items are added to the stack using the
    `Push` method and removed using the `Pop` method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An application's `Undo` menu can be implemented using a stack. For example,
    in a word processor, as the user edits a document, an `Action` delegate is created,
    which can reverse the most recent change whenever the user presses `Ctrl` + `Z`.
    The most recent action is popped off the stack and the change is undone. This
    allows multiple steps to be undone.

    general-purpose language that can be used to query objects in memory by using
    a syntax that is similar to Structured Query Language (SQL), that is, it is used
    to query databases. It is an enhancement of the C# language that makes it easier
    to interact with objects in memory using SQL-like Query Expressions or Query Operators
    (implemented through a series of extension methods).

    and data sources, such as relational databases and XML, using LINQ providers.
    LINQ providers form a set of building blocks that can be used to query various
    sources of data, using a similar set of Query Operators, without the caller needing
    to know the intricacies of how each data source works. The following is a list
    of providers and how they are used:'

- en: In this chapter, you saw how the `IEnumerable` and `ICollection` interfaces
    form the basis of .NET data structures, and how they can be used to store multiple
    items. You created different types of collections depending on how each collection
    is meant to be used. You learned that the `List` collection is most extensively
    used to store collections of items, particularly if the number of elements is
    not known at compile time. You saw that the `Stack` and `Queue` types allow the
    order of items to be handled in a controlled manner, and how the `HashSet` offers
    set-based processing, while the `Dictionary` stores unique values using a key
    identifier.
