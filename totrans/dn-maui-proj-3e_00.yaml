    from the ground up. You will gain the fundamental skills you need to set up your
    environment, and we will explain what .NET Mobile is before we transition into
    .NET MAUI to really take advantage of truly native cross-platform code.'

    takes to create an app that you can build on and that stands the test of time.

    consuming REST interfaces, real-time communication using SignalR, and location
    tracking using a device’s GPS. There is also room for machine learning, a touch
    of .NET Blazor, and the must-have to-do list.

- en: This book is for developers who know their way around C# and Visual Studio.
    You don’t have to be a professional programmer, but you should have basic knowledge
    of object-oriented programming using .NET and C#. The typical reader would be
    someone who wants to explore how you can use .NET Mobile, and specifically .NET
    MAUI, to create applications using .NET and C#.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No knowledge of .NET Mobile is required in advance, but it would be a great
    help if you’ve worked with traditional .NET Mobile and want to take the step toward
    .NET MAUI.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B19214_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Introduction to .NET MAUI*,
    explains the basic concepts of .NET Mobile and .NET MAUI. It helps you understand
    the building blocks of how to create a true cross-platform app. It’s the only
    theoretical chapter of the book and will help you get started and set up your
    development environment.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B19214_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101), *Building Our First .NET MAUI
    App*, guides you through the concepts of **Model-View-ViewModel** (**MVVM**) and
    explains how to use the Inversion of Control pattern to simplify the creation
    of views and view models. We will create a to-do app that supports navigation,
    filtering, and the addition of to-do items to a list, and will also render a user
    interface that takes advantage of the powerful data-binding mechanisms in .NET
    MAUI.'

    App to .NET MAUI*, walks through the steps to convert an existing Xamarin.Forms
    app running on Mono to a .NET MAUI app running on .NET 7\. We will discuss two
    different methods for converting your Xamarin.Forms application to .NET MAUI.
    The first method will use a new .NET MAUI project and move our old Xamarin.Forms
    code into the new project, and the second method will use the **.NET Upgrade Assistant**
    tool to do some of the upgrades for us.'

    .NET MAUI Shell*, explores the default navigation template in .NET MAUI, `Shell`,
    a standard way to define the structure of .NET MAUI apps. In this chapter, you
    will learn all you need to know to use `Shell` in a .NET MAUI app.'

    Rich UX Using Animations*, lets you dive deeper into how to define a richer user
    interface with animations and content placement. It also covers the concept of
    custom controls to encapsulate the user interface into self-contained components.'

    App Using GPS and Maps*, taps into the use of geolocation data from the device’s
    GPS and how to plot this data on a layer on a map. It also explains how to use
    background services to keep tracking the location over a long period of time to
    create a heat map of where you spend your time.'

    follows on from the previous chapter and covers the frontend of the app – in this
    case, a .NET MAUI app that connects to the backend and relays messages between
    users. The chapter focuses on setting up SignalR on the client side and explains
    how to create a service model that abstracts this communication through messages

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We recommend that you read the first chapter to make sure that you are up to
    speed with the basic concepts of Xamarin in general. After that, you could pretty
    much pick any chapter you would like to learn more about. Each chapter is standalone
    but the chapters are ordered by complexity; the further you are into the book,
    the more complex the app will be.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The apps are adapted for real-world use but some parts are left out, such as
    proper error handling and analytics, since they are out of the scope of the book.
    However, you should get a good grasp of the building blocks of how to create an
    app.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having said that, it does help if you have been a C# and .NET developer for
    a while, since many of the concepts are not really app-specific but are good practice
    in general, such as MVVM and Inversion of Control.
