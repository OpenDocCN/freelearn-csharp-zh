    overall scope, its structure, and its content. We'll explore real-world examples
    and help you build an understanding of how to better document the size, complexity,
    and dependencies in your game, as well as to help you estimate your tasks.

- en: The game's scope is a term used to define the project's perceived size and complexity.
    Without knowing the scope in advance, any production scheduling, costing, and
    staffing would be nigh on impossible. The scope is usually well defined by the
    time you wrap up the first version of the game design document.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a game designer working on establishing the initial scope, it's your responsibility
    to list all of the game's features, functionalities, and systems, as well as to
    approximate the entirety of the game's content. This includes the quantity and
    complexity of gameplay mechanics, playable levels, missions, cutscenes, storylines
    and dialog, sound effects and music, playable and unplayable characters, weapons,
    power-ups, items, and so on.

    harder but more important than dreaming of new features. The term feature creep
    is often used when describing scenarios (or even whole projects) in which we attempt
    to resolve our problems and make the game more compelling by adding more and more
    features and content, rather than working out the issues living deep within the
    base game systems and mechanics. Knowing what to keep and what to cut is an essential
    skill for any game designer. Changes on paper and during prototyping are the easiest
    and cheapest to make. Don't be afraid to propose cuts early on, as later may end
    up being too late.

    deal with continuous iteration. This means that your scope will stay relatively
    undefined and flexible for the duration of the project. Such scenarios are rare,
    require clear short-and mid-term objectives, and should not become an excuse to
    generate an unsustainable amount of work for yourself or others. After all, even
    if time and resources are not an issue, you rarely want to spend ten years on
    a single game, only to have the entire industry move towards a different direction,
    distribution platform, and technology.

    for owning a PC. Most games gradually drifted away from high score-driven challenges
    and sports-like competitions, and towards more defined experiences that told a
    story or posed a challenge that can be solved, mastered, and exhausted. Limited
    replay value was not necessarily an outcome of basic game mechanics, but rather
    of a desire to raise the quality of games, control their difficulty with predefined
    challenges, and thoroughly utilize all assets and playable content.

    designed to be experienced (or consumed). This would include things such as game
    levels, items, characters, abilities, vehicles, achievements, weapons, missions,
    and storylines. Since the main gameplay mechanics and rules are the essential
    foundations upon which everything is built, you generally do not treat them as
    parts of the game content. Instead, you focus on anything that builds upon your
    foundations, adds value, and increases the lifetime of your game.

    cars, and car parts (including cosmetic items such as paint colors and stickers
    you can put on your car), as well as the breadth of available game modes (such
    as time-trial, single-race, tournament, multiplayer head-to-head, and so on).
    Sounds, music, and the story would also be included, but these components are
    admittedly less likely to make or break the product. After all, it's safe to assume
    that many players will quickly lose interest once they master the game mechanics
    and familiarize themselves with all tracks, cars, and modes, no matter how much
    story and music we put into the product.

    feature. Let's say you're working on a collection feature. Not knowing that the
    initial set of 10 collectible items will be later expanded to 100 can have very
    dangerous consequences. The entire user interface around the feature might need
    to be remade and the code for creating, storing and displaying these items rewritten.
    In a sample scenario with only 10 items, your User Interface designer may opt
    for using large, animated objects, but as soon as that number grows to 100 the
    inventory becomes hard to navigate and the game's performance suffers and all
    because the rest of the team were not prepared to support your final intentions.
    The art assets themselves might even go through an entirely different (and more
    systemic) pipeline once the aspirations for a large quantity are known. You could
    even end up using an art outsourcer or automating large parts of the creation
    and implementation processes!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As players interact with your game, they will not only gain mastery over game
    mechanics and systems, they will also grow more familiar with the contents of
    your game. Humans love to learn, and good learning opportunities are rewarded
    with feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction. We easily get excited by anything
    new—a fresh challenge, an untold story, an undiscovered land. While this part
    of the human condition leads to our players seeking out and enjoying our games,
    it also leads to them being bored by repetitive and unchallenging tasks or familiar
    stories. Boredom is what we try to avoid, and unfortunately for we designers,
    people are as good at learning as they are at spotting patterns. The same brain
    that can spot animals in the shapes of clouds, or a human face within a picture
    of a Martian rock, will be exposed to seeing your game—often for hours on end.
    The sole act of exposure to the same set of 3D props and art pieces used to create
    a seemingly unique dungeon will lead to a feeling of fatigue and boredom. The
    same fate befalls any content that players interact with repeatedly, including
    mechanics and systems that do not seem to hold any secrets and potential learning.

    they burn through it, permanently diminishing its value.

    board states skyrockets to 400—each being more or less a valid and meaningful
    move. These games rely not on supplying new content but on the availability of
    interesting move sets and challenging opponents to play against (you can play
    chess against an AI, but it's arguably much less fun without a human opponent).

    is, look at games such as Rocket League—a game that could be described as football
    played with cars. The rules and victory conditions are simple and elegant: get
    the ball to the enemy goal by hitting it with your car. The amount of content
    required for this gameplay to work is impressively small—one arena, one car, a
    boost pad, and a ball. The game is played in small teams (from 2 to 4 players
    per team), where each player controls a single car that drives in a familiar way,
    but players can also jump and steer their car in the air and use a rocket boost
    to propel themselves. Hit the ball with your car and try to get it to the opponent''s
    goal and… that''s it! Simple, right? Yet, for many, the replayability is through
    the roof! The way Rocket League achieved its elusive easy-to-learn, hard-to-master
    status is all down to the simplicity of the rules paired with the incredibly high
    skill ceiling of precisely controlling the movements of your car in relation to

    scenarios. Before you add any new rule or feature in the hopes of extending the

    constrained and applied in a careful, deliberate way. If done right, it can add
    thrills and make the game slightly less predictable, without undermining the player's
    ability to plan ahead. Do it badly and you'll end up with an unplayable mess where
    player actions seem to have little influence over the end result and it's impossible

    as well as breaking the balance of the game (making it either too easy or impossible

    that fully randomized effects can lead to players feeling cheated by the game

    Keith distinguishes between two types of randomness: input randomness and output
    randomness. Input randomness is described as one that informs player’s decisions,
    for example, map generation. Players cannot affect or predict it in advance, but
    will able to make decisions based on what they''ve been served. On the other hand,
    we have output randomness, which defines the outcome of a player''s actions, for
    example, a die roll that determines whether the action (which you''ve already
    committed to) was successful or not. Be very careful when you inject your game
    with output randomness! The feedback on the player''s actions can become confusing
    and may limit satisfaction from performing good decisions, as well as the opportunity
    to learn from one''s mistakes. A valid move can be met with a failed result, while
    a mistake on the player''s part could yield a positive outcome.'

    the lifespan of the game's content; others put it at the heart of their game mechanics.
    Card games such as Magic The Gathering or Hearthstone would lose most of their
    appeal if the decks always produced the cards in a predefined sequence. As for
    Hearthstone itself, the designers have added a wide selection of cards that provide
    randomized effects after they're played – a great example of using the aforementioned
    output randomness. It's a polarizing set of cards that can result in both moments
    of great elevation (Oh my, I got so lucky!), as well as ones of great frustration
    (This? Really? I quit!). Unless you can provide your players with a clear indication
    of risk and uncertainty, you should shy away from using output randomness in key
    areas of the game.

    World of Warcraft, groups of players would often replay the same dungeon several
    times in order to get a chance at the desired item. An extreme version of reward
    randomization is found in a game that uses a Gacha-based (Gacha, from the Japanese
    word gachapon, refers to capsules sold in vending machines and containing random
    toys inside) business model. In such games, the most important items in the game
    that gate player progression are stashed away in randomized loot boxes. It's important
    to know that not every implementation of gacha rewards is the same (and therefore
    always fully randomized). A so-called box-gacha refers to a reward set with random
    chances but no duplicate rewards. Imagine a box with a strictly defined set of
    10 items. Even if one of these items has a tiny 0.1% chance of dropping, you can
    be sure that you'll get the item within 10 tries. The worst case scenario is that
    you'll need to pull out 9 other items first.

    filler content and duplicate rewards—there's nothing more demotivating than getting

    you can convert them into useful resources? More on this type of rewarding and

    scope of the game. Moreover, procedurally generated worlds/items/stories rarely
    feel as special as handcrafted ones. There's a lot you can do by simply randomizing
    a few elements rather than creating them from scratch. If your game requires a
    high quantity of content and you need to rely on procedural generation, think
    of ways in which you can maintain a level of control over the critical parts of
    it.

    turn that content creation into a significant part of your game. In games like

    campaign). The game has dominated what we now call a build and battle genre, a
    mix of a real-time strategy and a tower defense game. In these games, players
    build and upgrade their bases (carefully placing their defenses to protect themselves),
    recruit troops, and attack other players to take their resources. Incentivizing
    players to protect their resources drives each and every player to create a new,
    highly playable map for everyone else. Moderation impact is minimal for the developer,

    means necessary. You can inject screenshots from reference games or earlier prototypes,
    comments, wireframes (rough sketches of the user interface and content)—everything
    flies as long as it helps you communicate effectively. If you really need a diamond
    decision box with forking paths—use it! But, if you're going to write up a detailed
    explanation of that part of the game anyway (with potentially its very own flow
    chart), opt for simplicity and put it all in a simple box.

    Instead, treat them as a great way to present your vision, a solid starting point
    that enables the team to spot flaws early on and allows for a more informed discussion
    to take place. Do not over-explain too early and be prepared to edit and re-work
    everything. Again, the more changes you make on paper, the better and more efficient
    your team can be!

    production schedules. To do that, a list of task and assets to produce is assembled
    based on the design documentation. These tasks are then paired with estimates
    that (in the best-case scenario) come from the people who will actually end up
    doing said tasks. If the project is highly inventive and/or staff members inexperienced,
    more senior employees might get involved in helping with the initial schedule.

    ever survives contact with the enemy." First production schedules are likely to
    be very, very wrong. In the beginning, things will usually take longer than anticipated,
    and a lot of unknown problems, changes in direction, and missed tasks will emerge.
    Fortunately, as time goes on, your team's experience with the product grows and
    your tools are likely to improve, making the creation of future game content much
    quicker than initially anticipated. Good development studios and publishers acknowledge
    that games are very hard to plan accurately, and are prepared to be reasonably
    flexible.

    detail when it comes to planning and task preparation. Long-term plans tend to
    be loose and based on rough estimations; the game might have a shipping date from
    the beginning, but it''s very unlikely to be the actual one. Mid-term plans (next
    few months), usually focus on clear goals that the team is striving to achieve
    for example: getting the first level playable, finishing the character customization
    system, testing network code. Short-term plans (next two sprints, that is, development
    cycles) are the most detailed and least likely to change, as they contain lists
    of detailed tasks, order by priority, which is either worked on right now or will
    be assessed for inclusion in the next development cycle.'

    deliverable tasks for artists (such as character models, animations, environments,

- en: Your best work on nearly any game is the work you'll do last, built upon the
    breadth of experience with the product. The middle of the game is very much such
    as the middle of a book or a movie, no matter how good it is, if the beginning
    is bad no one will reach it, and if the ending sucks, that's the only thing they'll
    remember. Almost all games benefit from starting the development partway through
    the player journey, no matter how annoying it is to not have the game playable
    from the start for a long period of time. If you're to create a platform game
    with 10 stages, start on level 3 or 4, followed by more work on the middle chunk,
    then do the start and finally the end.

    and applies to individual features. For example, you're working on multiple campaigns,
    but you must deliver them in order, perhaps you can start each campaign in the
    middle? What also helps is the extra frame of reference that you gain as you start
    in the middle. It's more convenient to aim for medium difficulty level, then dial
    it up and down as needed, than to start easy and keep escalating up.
