    experiment with code without losing important changes. Source control is the ability
    to track and maintain changes made to code throughout a development process. While
    this could include code, it can also be used for documentation, assets (such as
    images), and other resources. Being able to test certain conditions and the ability
    to refactor code without worrying about the code base is what most developers
    consider a superpower.

    a developer checks in code and later realizes they made a mistake, source control
    gives developers a way to revert changes or update a branch and re-commit. Companies
    not using some type of source control almost always raises a red flag.

    created from *main/master*, with the code checked in, reviewed, updated, and immediately
    merged back into main/master. A feature branch is more of an organized or scheduled
    approach. The feature branch is created from the *develop branch*, with the code
    checked in, reviewed, and merged back into the feature branch. The feature branch
    is scheduled to be merged into a release branch.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of some kind, which we’ll review as follows. The concept of this branch is to
    always have a version error-free, tested, and ready to deploy at any time. Some
    small start-up companies use this type of workflow when starting out. With GitFlow
    considered as a baseline in the industry, it’s easy to apply the GitFlow concepts
    when the team grows and is looking for a more structured workflow.

    with issue tracking using feature-driven development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    such as production and QA. Of course, you can create as many “environment branches”
    as necessary. If we had a QA environment branch, this may be used to test the
    final product. In *Figure 1**.5*, we see the standard `feature` branches created
    from the `main` branch along with two other environment branches (pre-production
    and production).

    it’s a place to test the feature branches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to GitHub Flow, everything merges into the `main` branch. When the feature
    branch is committed, code reviews are conducted (these are mandatory), and merged
    to main, all tests (yes, *all*) run. If the tests run for longer than five minutes,
    configure them to run in parallel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the testing is complete in main, `main` is pushed to `pre-production` for
    further testing and, finally, pushed to production. Since releases in GitLab Flow
    are based on tags, each tag should create a new release.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a developer introduced a bug, it would have to be fixed in main first, then
    the environment branches second. The developer would have to create a bugfix branch,
    commit with a PR approval, conduct a code review, and merge the code along with
    running tests related to the bug before they could continue through the workflow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once tested in main, it’s tagged and automatically promoted to pre-production
    and then production. Long-running branches in this workflow include main and the
    environment branches. Short-lived branches are the features, hotfix, and bugfix
    branches.

    branch.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with a single commit. It essentially rewrites the commit history. Of course, this
    differs from a merge. Merging is the process of taking all of the commits from
    one branch and merging the entire progress into another branch. Merging maintains
    the entire history of commits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
