- en: .NET MAUI is Microsoft’s cross-platform development framework for building iOS,
    Android, Windows, Mac, and Tizen apps. With .NET MAUI, you build the UI and the
    logic once and emit native code for each platform. It is the successor technology
    to **Xamarin.Forms** and adds powerful new features and capabilities.

    generators, behaviors, and much more, greatly enhancing and extending .NET MAUI
    as the premier development framework for building applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B19723_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016), *Assembling Your Tools and
    Creating Your First App*, shows you how to download the (free) software you need
    and will teach you how to create an “out-of-the-box” app to see what is provided
    to get you started.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B19723_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor027), *What We Will Build – Forget
    Me Not*, introduces our non-trivial, real-world app – “Forget Me Not.” We’ll go
    over what it does and then we’ll walk through the various pages to see the entire
    completed project that we’ll be working on for the rest of the book.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B19723_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor036), *XAML and Fluent C#*, explores
    the markup language used to create the UI of a .NET MAUI app. We’ll also examine
    how you can write the UI in C# if you prefer.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B19723_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054), *MVVM and Controls*, examines
    the most popular and powerful architecture for building .NET MAUI apps – **Model-View-ViewModel**
    (**MVVM**). We’ll also take a look at many of the core controls used to create
    the UI.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B19723_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092), *Advanced Controls*, builds
    on the previous chapter, adding more advanced controls to create a more powerful
    and robust UI.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B19723_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115), *Layout*, focuses on the techniques
    to arrange the controls on your view and create a professional appearance.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B19723_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor129), *Understanding Navigation*,
    shows how you move from one page to another and how you can pass along data as
    you navigate. No serious .NET MAUI app has only one page.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B19723_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor144), *Storing and Retrieving Data*,
    explores the two ways to persist data. The first is useful for storing a user’s
    preferences for the program. The second involves building a relational database
    using SQLite.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B19723_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160), *Unit Testing*, shows how
    to use xUnit and the mocking tool **nSubstitute** to create powerful unit tests.
    No .NET MAUI program is complete without an extensive suite of unit tests to ensure
    a program is working correctly.'

- en: '[*Chapter 10*](B19723_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187), *Consuming REST Services*,
    explores how to validate a user’s login and obtain their data from Azure. Many
    modern apps get their data from the cloud, and the most popular way to do so is
    by using REST services.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 11*](B19723_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216), *Exploring Advanced Topics*,

- en: You will want to have at least fundamental experience with an object-oriented
    language, especially C#. You do not need to know the latest advances in C#, and
    the example code is explained in depth. You will want the latest version of Visual
    Studio; the Community Edition is free and will work fine. If you are on a Mac
    (or Linux), the examples should work fine with Visual Studio for Mac, although
    they were not developed on a Mac.

    for it and most .NET MAUI apps, and we’ll undertake an extensive review of the
    controls and structures used to build the user interface.
