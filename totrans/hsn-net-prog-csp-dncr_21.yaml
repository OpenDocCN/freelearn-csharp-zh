- en: In this brief final part of the book, we'll be exploring more advanced topics,
    and consider how to move past the network programming features .NET Core provides
    directly out of the box. In the first chapter, we'll look at how to extend functionality
    and expected behavior with Microsoft's *Pluggable Protocols*Â pattern. Next, we'll
    think about how to examine the traffic over our networks, and determine its performance
    and stability. Finally, we'll look at implementing an SSH client and remote access
    between machines.
