    Development*, is the longest chapter of the book and shows application development
    with ABP Framework with an extensive example application. It is the main chapter
    for putting everything together. After this chapter, you may not understand all
    the ABP features but will be able to create your own application with the fundamental
    ABP concepts. You will understand the big picture here. Then, you will fill in
    the gaps and learn about all the details in the next chapters.'

    Layer*, continues looking at DDD with the domain layer. It begins by explaining
    the EventHub domain objects, since the examples in this chapter and the next chapter
    will be based on these objects. You will learn how to design aggregates; implement
    domain services, repositories, and specifications; and use an event bus to publish
    domain events.'

    focuses on another fundamental ABP architecture, multi-tenancy, which is an architectural
    pattern to build **Software-as-a-Service** (**SaaS**) solutions. You will see
    whether multi-tenancy is the right architecture for your solution and learn how
    to develop your code to be compatible with ABP’s multi-tenancy system. This chapter
    also covers ABP’s features system, which is used to define application functionalities
    as features and assign them to tenants in a multi-tenant solution.'
