Dynamics NAV offers some tools that can help to accomplish this, which we will cover in this chapter:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Budgets</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Cash flow management</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec42"/>Budgets</h1></div></div></div><p>Budgets are an overview of planned costs, revenues, and resources over a specified period of time. Dynamics NAV allows you to create budgets for fixed assets, items, sales and purchases, and projects. But we will focus on general ledger budgets in this section.</p><p>With the general ledger budget feature, you can create multiple budgets for the same time periods, simple or complex budgets by selecting combinations of G/L accounts, periods, and dimensions. You can also copy budgets from previous periods or create your budgets outside the application, with Excel, and then import it into Dynamics NAV.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec59"/>Creating budgets</h2></div></div></div><p>Let's create a new budget for the first quarter of 2017. Perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In the <strong>Search</strong> box, type <code class="literal">G/L Budgets</code> and select the related link.</li><li class="listitem">Once on the <strong>G/L Budgets</strong> page, click on <strong>New</strong> on the ribbon bar.

Then double-click on the <strong>Budgeted Amount</strong> field for the account <strong>44110</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">On the <strong>G/L Budget Entries</strong> page, create the following lines:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_05_04.jpg" alt="Creating budgets"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Back to the budget page, you will see that the created lines are summarized in the corresponding periods. You can refer to the <strong>Budget Matrix</strong> page.</li><li class="listitem">Remove the filter from the <strong>Department Filter</strong> field.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Copy Budget</strong> option from the ribbon bar. To run the <strong>Copy G/L Budget</strong> job, select the following options, as shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_05_05.jpg" alt="Creating budgets"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">We have filtered the <strong>G/L Account No.</strong> field to only include the two accounts we were working on. In the <strong>Date</strong> field, we have selected the same period from the previous year. Therefore, in the <strong>Date Change Formula:</strong> input box, type <code class="literal">1Y</code> in order to add one year to the dates. We are creating budgets for the <strong>CUSTOMERGROUP</strong> and <strong>AREA</strong> dimensions, so we have checked them on the <strong>Dimensions</strong> field.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, we want to apply a 10% of sales increment, so we choose <code class="literal">1.1</code> as the adjustment factor. We choose to compress movements on a monthly basis and to round amounts to hundreds.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>OK</strong>. The system will create new budget entries based on real general ledger entries from previous periods. We have already created the budget for two different areas. For the rest of the areas, we will create an Excel template and ask the area director to fill in the budget for us. Then, we will import the Excel sheets to complete our budget.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Export to Excel</strong> option from the ribbon bar.

Now, we will see when budgets can be used. Budgets are mainly to compare reality versus budgeted amounts to measure performance. Budget entries can be also used as a source for the cash flow management. We will cover those in the next section.</p><p>The <strong>Trial Balance/Budget</strong> report, found under <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>General Ledger</strong> | <strong>Reports</strong> | <strong>Financial Statement</strong>, compares the balance of each account in the charts of accounts with its budgeted amount for a given period.</p><p>You can also use budgets on <strong>Account Schedules</strong> to measure performance in an aggregate way. In the <strong>Column Layout</strong> definition, in the <strong>Ledger Entry type</strong> field, you can select the <strong>Budget Entries</strong> value to base the calculation on budget entries. To see an example, navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Setup</strong> | <strong>General</strong> | <strong>Column Layouts</strong> and analyze the definition of the <strong>ACT/BUD</strong> column layout.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec43"/>Cash flow management</h1></div></div></div><p>Understanding the flow of incoming and outstanding cash is vital for any company. We need to know if we will have enough money to pay creditors and expenses when they are due. This is actually what the cash flow management functionality will tell us. We will see how to do this in this section.</p><p>The cash flow management functionalities analyze several sources of information to be able to predict cash needs. The sources that this functionality uses are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>General ledger</strong>: This uses information about the liquid funds and also about the budgets we have seen in the previous section</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Purchases</strong>: This uses information about the current payables and also forecasted information taken from open purchase orders</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Sales</strong>: This uses information about the current receivables and also forecasted information taken from open sales orders</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Service</strong>: This uses information about open service orders</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Fixed assets</strong>: This uses information about planned disposal and budgeted purchases of fixed assets</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Manual revenues and expenses</strong>: This can also use information that we can set up manually, such as salaries, interest on credits, private consumptions, and so on</li></ul></div><p>Let's see how it works by creating a cash flow forecast:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Cash Flow</strong> | <strong>Cash Flow Forecasts</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>New</strong> to create a new cash flow forecast.</li><li class="listitem">Press the <em>Enter</em> key. The system will give a number to the new forecast.</li><li class="listitem">Enter the information shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_05_07.jpg" alt="Cash flow management"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Close the cash flow forecast card.</li></ol></div><p>We have created a forecast and we have set up the basic information about it. The next step is to obtain cash information from the system and bring it to our forecast. To do so, perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Cash Flow</strong> | <strong>Cash Flow Worksheet</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Suggest Worksheet Lines</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">In the <strong>Cash Flow Forecast</strong> field, select the forecast you have just created.</li><li class="listitem">Specify the sources from which you want to take information out to do your cash flow prediction. For example, we have selected all of the available sources, as shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_05_08.jpg" alt="Cash flow management"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>OK</strong>. The system will look on all the specified sources and will create lines on the <strong>Cash Flow Worksheet</strong>. On those lines, you will see: the <strong>Source Type</strong>, the <strong>Source No.</strong>, the <strong>Cash Flow Date</strong>, and the <strong>Amount</strong> in local currency.</li><li class="listitem">You can modify the suggested lines, delete them, or create new ones. This will allow you to adjust the suggestion in order to have a better forecast.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Register</strong>.</li></ol></div><p>At this point, we have created our cash flow forecast and we have brought to it, all the information about incoming and outgoing cash movements. Now, it's time to analyze all this information to be able to detect any liquidity problems.</p><p>Open the cash flow forecast card and click on <strong>CF Availability by Periods</strong>. In this window, which is shown in the following screenshot, we can observe a liquidity problem in week 3. The liquidity problem will be solved in the fourth week. We can reschedule some of the purchase orders or negotiate a longer payment term with our vendors. Consider the following instance:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_05_09.jpg" alt="Cash flow management"/></div><p>
</p><p>By double-clicking on the <strong>Purchase Orders</strong> value for week <strong>3</strong>, we will see which purchase orders are due this week. Actually, there is only one purchase order, which is due on <code class="literal">13/01/2017</code>. We have talked to our vendor and have agreed to move the payment date to <code class="literal">21/01/2017</code>. After updating the payment information on the purchase order, we have suggested and registered new lines for the forecast on the cash flow worksheet. As we can see on the <strong>CF Availability by Periods</strong> window now, the cash problem doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_05_10.jpg" alt="Cash flow management"/></div><p>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec61"/>Creating manual expenses and revenues</h2></div></div></div><p>Manual expenses and revenues can be created to complete the cash information that will be used to analyze the evolution of the company's liquidity. There is a lot of cash information that is already in the system (such as <strong>Receivables </strong>and <strong>Payables</strong>), but there is also a lot of other cash information that is not in the system and that we will have to input manually.</p><p>To create a cash flow manual expense, perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Cash Flow</strong> and click on <strong>Cash Flow Manual Expenses</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>New</strong> icon and create a new manual expense with the information shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_05_11.jpg" alt="Creating manual expenses and revenues"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>These are manual expenses such as <strong>Personnel Costs</strong>, <strong>Running Costs</strong>, and <strong>Finance Costs</strong> of <strong>130000</strong>, <strong>75000</strong>, <strong>15000</strong> for every month from <strong>01/01/2017</strong> to <strong>12/31/2017</strong>. For now, these expenses will be taken into account while suggesting worksheet lines for our forecasts.</p><p>Manual revenues are created in a similar way at <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Cash Flow</strong> | <strong>Cash Flow Manual Revenues</strong>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec62"/>Cash flow management setup</h2></div></div></div><p>The cash flow management functionality uses its own chart of accounts: the chart of <strong>Cash Flow Accounts</strong>. You can define the chart of accounts you need. For those cash flow accounts that will get their information from the general ledger or from the budget, you will have to specify a G/L account filter and the type of G/L integration (balance, budget, or both):</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_05_12.jpg" alt="Cash flow management setup"/></div><p>
</p><p>Once the chart of cash flow accounts is complete, we will have to complete the setup by navigating to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Cash Flow</strong> | <strong>Cash Flow Setup</strong> and defining the <strong>Cash Flow Account...</strong> where the suggested lines will be posted from the different areas. In the following screenshot, you can see which information you will have to provide:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_05_13.jpg" alt="Cash flow management setup"/></div><p>
</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec44"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we saw the tools that can help companies in the task of predicting and anticipating financial events. You learned to create new budgets using different sources of information. You can manually introduce budgeted amounts, copy it from real general ledger entries with an adjustment factor, or import it from Excel. You also learned how to predict cash needs by analyzing several sources of information, such as liquid funds, receivables and payables, outstanding orders, and budgets.</p><p>So far, we have come across sales and purchases, bank account management, and different accounting processes. In Dynamics NAV, everything leads to accounting, but most of the operations inside the financial management area can be done with little accountancy knowledge. In the next chapter, we will learn the setup options that allow this to happen.</p></div></body></html>
