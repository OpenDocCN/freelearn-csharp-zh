- en: Have you ever stopped to think about the number of technologies, languages,
    and frameworks that currently exist for developing software solutions? It is certainly
    almost impossible to list them since, with technological advancement, new frameworks,
    and technologies emerge every day. Associated with the collaboration model proposed
    by the open source movement, access to information and source code of technologies
    from major players allows people to develop their own technologies, which end
    up becoming a path for developing solutions.

- en: In the context of web applications, there have been several developments and,
    with these, different approaches and tools have emerged that allow the development
    of increasingly rich and complex applications. Often, the traditional client-server
    development model is no longer sufficient for certain contexts, and with the evolution
    of technologies, the use of other approaches to improve the user experience of
    web applications has made JavaScript frameworks popular, giving rise to other
    development models such as the use of **Single-Page Applications** ( **SPAs**
    ), which, combined with a powerful server-side processing model, make web applications
    more interactive and richer than ever. When we look back at the development model
    from a few years ago, we needed a few JavaScript files, an interpreted language
    such as PHP, Perl, or Classic ASP to process requests on the server side, and
    a database to persist information.

    advances increasingly faster. The web solution development model has gone from
    a stack of three or four technologies to a multitude of resources, packages, frameworks,
    standards, design patterns, and, no less important, interaction with cloud environments.
    While we have a modern development scenario, we are also involved in a great complexity
    of available resources so that we can create rich solutions that have the capacity
    to support the diverse needs of the market and dynamically follow the constant
    evolution and changes in the needs of organizations to deliver solutions that
    are increasingly more adherent to the market, remaining competitive.

- en: Dealing with different technologies is also a challenge for several teams that
    must learn different languages and standards, and also use different tools to
    combine these technologies and maintain a sustainable distributed development
    model. This book aims to provide tools, standards, and possibilities to software
    engineers who need to deliver web solutions in a dynamic manner, delivering constant
    value, while benefiting from best practices and staying up to date in a scenario
    of constant technological evolution. To achieve these goals, we will learn about
    the ASP.NET Core 9 platform, which is a powerful open-source solution from Microsoft
    that allows us to develop high-quality applications, prepared to deal with the
    standards and requirements of cloud-native applications and, best of all, centralized
    in a single platform.

- en: ASP.NET Core 9 is a technology that is constantly evolving and has modern features,
    allowing software engineers to have the ability to extend and customize while
    using high-level approaches for solutions that must be prepared to run in different
    types of environments, whether local, on-premises or especially in cloud environments.
    With ASP.NET Core 9, software engineers benefit from the use of practices such
    as interaction with CLI tools. It is independent of the operating system, has
    great support from the technical community that provides several packages and
    providers, and the framework is constantly evolving through the open-source community.
    It is a technology that has extensive documentation and support and is prepared
    for the most diverse types of solutions, in addition to adapting to the cloud-native
    model and, of course, has the capacity to integrate with other technologies, in
    addition to JavaScript frameworks.

    of the ASP.NET Core 9 platform, in addition to understanding development approaches
    and cloud architectures, learning about the best resources for designing web solutions,
    using mechanisms for delivering constant value in an automated manner such as
    **Continuous Integration** ( **CI** ) and **Continuous Delivery** ( **CD** ),
    among other patterns and best practices of the cloud-native solution development
    model, and much more.

    for developing web-based solutions. It goes beyond the traditional aspect and
    brings an innovative perspective based on the needs of the technology market.
    It addresses fundamental issues ranging from platform knowledge, updates, environment
    preparation, implementation and use of best security and development practices,
    and constant delivery through automated solutions such as CI and CD, cloud-native
    development practices, containerization, and several other aspects of the ASP.NET
