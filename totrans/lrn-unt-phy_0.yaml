- en: In order to understand what it means to implement a Physics component of Unity3D
    successfully in games and applications, a developer must have a better understanding
    of the key elements of Physics and their behavior in the engine. I wrote this
    book to provide a detailed description with examples for learning a Physics component
    of Unity3D in a way that emphasizes the uniqueness of each component and their
    implementation.

- en: The successful implementation of Physics in game or application development
    starts with a strong understanding of each component. When we look at game and
    application development in Unity3D, it is easy to see that Physics is the most
    important component. I have provided the conceptual foundation of a Physics component
    and introduced these using examples for a better understanding.

    This book focuses on the Physics components of Unity3D and their implementations.'

- en: '**Implementation**: My experience as a developer has taught me two things about
    examples: they need to be detailed, and they must help developers do their work.
    As a result, users of my book will always find abundant examples with every step
    carefully laid out and explained wherever necessary so that the reader can follow.
    To describe and explain the Physics of Unity3D, this book uses realistic examples
    to help developers get inside of what Physics is really like. In addition to the
    examples, I have provided detailed screenshots and figures for a better understanding.
    These examples will help developers in the successful implementation of Physics
    components in their game or application as well as help them identify the best
    practices they need to adopt to improve their game or application performance.'

- en: '**A structured approach**: I have tried to explain Physics and Unity3D in a
    reader-friendly way. Most books claim to do this, but my experience with a variety
    of books has proven otherwise. What students and developers will find in my book
    are short, precise explanations of terms and concepts that are written in an understandable
    language. For example, I have used more images rather than text to explain steps
    of implementations, which gives a better understanding for readers.'
