- en: In any development project, it is vital to set up the right kind of development
    environment so that you can concentrate on the developing the solution rather
    than solving environment issues or configuration problems. With respect to .NET,
    Visual Studio is the defacto standard **IDE** ( **Integrated Development Environment**
    ) for building web applications in .NET.

    compile it, and execute it.

- en: 'When you develop a web application, you might need the following things to
    be productive:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Code editor** : This is the text editor where you type your code. Your code
    editor should be able to recognize different constructs such as the `if` condition,
    `for` loop of your programming language. In Visual Studio, all of your keywords
    would be highlighted in blue color.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Intellisense** : Intellisense is a context aware code-completion feature
    available in most modern IDEs including Visual Studio. One such example is when
    you type a dot after an object; this *Intellisense* feature lists out all the
    methods available on the object. This helps the developers to write code faster
    and easier.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Build/Publish** : It would be helpful if you could build or publish the application
    using a single click or single command. Visual Studio provides several options
    out-of-the-box to build a separate project or to build the complete solution in
    a single click. This makes the build and deployment of your application easier.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Templates** : Depending on the type of the application, you might have to
    create different folders and files along with the boilerplate code. So, it''ll
    be very helpful if your IDE supports the creation of different kinds of template.
    Visual Studio generates different kinds of templates with the code for ASP.NET
    Web Forms, MVC, and Web API to get you up-and-running.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Ease of adding items** : Your IDE should allow you to add different kinds
    of items with ease. For example, you should be able to add an XML file without
    any issues. And if there is any problem with the structure of your XML file, it
    should be able to highlight the issue and provide information to help you to fix
    the issues.'

- en: Usually, in an ASP.NET web application, we would have the assemblies as references

    we have a JSON file by name `Project.json` , which will contain all the necessary
    configurations with all its .NET dependencies in the form of `NuGet` packages.
    This makes dependency management easier. `NuGet` is a package manager, provided
    by Microsoft, which makes package installation and uninstallation easier. Prior
    to `NuGet` , all dependencies had to be installed manually. The dependencies section
    identifies the list of dependent packages available for the application. The frameworks
    section informs us about frameworks, supported by the application. The scripts
    section identifies the script to be executed during the build process of the application.
    Include and exclude properties can be used in any section to include or exclude
    any item.
