<h1 id="_idParaDest-49" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor055" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Universal Design and Accessibility for UI</h1>
<p class="calibre3">When designing your interface, you want to consider all the different types of players who may interact with your game. You want to consider their size, their age, their current situation, their ambient location, their output device, their input device, their cognition, their preferences, their mobility levels, and more. You want your interface to be usable by as many types of people as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It’s important to consider these factors at the beginning of the design process as designing your UI initially with these things in mind is significantly easier than incorporating them later when your UI is already designed, built, and implemented.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14">What are universal design and accessible design?</li>
<li class="calibre14">Universal design principles</li>
<li class="calibre14">Accessibility design</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-50" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor056" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>What are universal design and accessible design?</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Ronald Mace <a id="_idIndexMarker099" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>coined the term <strong class="bold">universal design</strong> and defined it as follows:</p>
<p class="author-quote">“The design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Universal design is the concept of designing products that are usable by all people regardless of age, size, preference, ability, disability, condition, or situation. It does not focus on designing for a specific group of people but instead focuses on designing products that are useable by the widest range of people. While initially focused on architecture, the concepts of universal design have been expanded to include the design for all types of products, including video games. <strong class="bold">Accessible design</strong> is a design that specifically <a id="_idIndexMarker100" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>focuses on usability by those with impairments and disabilities and is a subset of universal design.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For a design to be effective, purposeful decisions must be made to ensure that the design is both functional and useful to all types of people. When designing a user interface, you should consider how to make it usable and accessible to all people from the beginning of the design process. It is much easier to design a universally usable and accessible UI if you start with these considerations in mind than it is to retrofit features on top of pre-existing interfaces.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the following sections, I will discuss considerations for designing user interfaces using the principles of universal design as well as the special considerations you should take to make your interface accessible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since this book is on the development of UI within Unity, which is primarily a video game engine, the majority of the examples and use cases I will describe will be related to video games.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-51" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor057" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Universal design principles</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In 1997, a working group at North Carolina State University developed the 7 Principles of Universal Design. These principles are meant to help guide the design of products so that they can <a id="_idIndexMarker101" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>be universally usable. These principles are formally defined in terms of different types of designs with an emphasis on architecture. I will paraphrase each principle in terms of its application to digital user interfaces and then provide examples of how each principle can be used in video game interface design. If you’d like to view the list of principles and their specific guidelines, you can visit <a href="https://universaldesign.ie/what-is-universal-design/the-7-principles/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://universaldesign.ie/what-is-universal-design/the-7-principles/</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Many of these principles overlap and some of the examples I will provide could apply to multiple principles.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-52" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor058" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Equitable use</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The equitable <a id="_idIndexMarker102" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>use principle states that a design should be equally usable and appealing to all. If an identical experience is not possible for all, they should have an equivalent experience. An interface should be designed to appeal to all users and should not stigmatize or segregate users. This is the first principle because it ultimately drives all the other principles.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For example, high-contrasting colors should be used in interfaces. High-contrasting interfaces are not only appealing to all users but they help mobile users sitting in direct sunlight see your interface and they avoid stigmatizing users with visual impairments such as low vision and color blindness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Remember that the goal of universal design is not explicitly about designing for accessibility (that is, designing for groups with disabilities). Utilizing something like a high-contrasting color scheme is beneficial to all, not just those with visual impairments. It is also not <a id="_idIndexMarker103" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>a setting that explicitly needs to be turned on, such as turning on a color blind mode, which would be designing for accessibility. I’ll discuss designing for accessibility later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you’re making a PC game, you don’t want to hide information so that it is only accessible by a mouse. Allowing information to be navigated to via the d-pad on a controller or tabbed to by a keyboard will allow users who are using different input devices (due to personal preference or vision impairments) to access the same information as a mouse user.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-53" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor059" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Flexibility in use</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The flexibility in use principle states that people with a wide range of preferences and abilities should <a id="_idIndexMarker104" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>be accommodated by the design and people should be provided choice in how they use the design. The key to this principle is providing users with choices when it comes to interacting with your game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you’re making a mobile game, you can provide left and right-handed modes that swap which side of the screen the buttons are on, as I did in my game Barkeology, which is shown in the following figure. This allows players to easily interact with the interface without blocking the gameplay with their dominant hand.</p>

<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.1: Left-handed mode versus right-handed mode in Barkeology for iOS</p>
<p class="calibre3">Fantasy Life Online lets you choose between three locations for the placement of the “fury button” – a button that appears whenever a special attack is available to the player. This allows <a id="_idIndexMarker105" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>the player to pick a location that is most comfortable to them based on their playstyle and the way they hold their phone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For PC games, you can allow players to choose different input devices. For example, you can provide the option to play with a keyboard and mouse or a controller. You can allow players to map the keyboard or controller however they wish or give them predefined schemes to choose from. Allowing players to choose controller button schemes is also applicable to consoles.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If your game has text, allow users to change the size or the speed at which it is presented to them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There are many more examples of ways in which you can allow flexibility in your interfaces. When designing your interfaces, just be sure to consider the different preferences your players may have so that you can lay out your interface and map your inputs accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-54" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor060" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Simple and intuitive use</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The simple and intuitive use principle states that a design should be easy to understand for people, regardless of their past knowledge, experience, skill, or language level.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Don’t make <a id="_idIndexMarker106" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>your interfaces overly complicated. If you have to explain it, it probably needs to be redesigned. Players who have never played a video game before should be able to understand your interface just as easily as a veteran.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Place the most important information in the most visible locations and make them the easiest to find. Don’t hide common functionality behind multiple button clicks and menus. If your menu system is nested and particular menus are accessed more frequently than others, consider mapping them to hotkeys or buttons.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Provide feedback to the user to let them know when they are interacting with your interface. If you have on-screen buttons meant to be interacted with by a tap or mouse click, have them provide feedback to the user to let them know when they have highlighted them or clicked on them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Provide prompts to the user that signal to the player which parts of your interface are interactable. You can accomplish this by designing buttons that look physically pressable or by drawing attention to items with animations or color schemes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It’s important to remember that your users will have various reading levels and may speak different languages. Reduce your dependency on text by using more <strong class="bold">icon metaphors</strong> when possible. Metaphors are symbols whose meanings are widely recognized. For example, most people will recognize the meaning of the buttons shown in the following figure as play, pause, menu, settings, close/cancel, confirm, mute, and save:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 4.2: Examples of interface metaphors" src="img/Figure_4.2_B18327.jpg" class="calibre48"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.2: Examples of interface metaphors</p>
<p class="calibre3">Accompany the icon metaphors with text so that users have multiple ways of perceiving what specific icons mean.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It’s not always possible to completely remove all text from your game’s UI and replace it with icons and imagery. So, translating your game into multiple languages could increase your UI’s universal perceptibility. In <a href="B18327_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor292" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, I will discuss things you can do while building your UI to make the translation process go more smoothly, as well as cover an example of creating a UI translation system.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-55" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor061" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Perceptible information</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The perceptible information principle states that information should be conveyed to users in a perceptible way regardless of the environment they are in or their sensory abilities. When considering this principle, you want to think of alternate ways in which information <a id="_idIndexMarker107" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>can be conveyed and how you can clearly convey it in multiple scenarios. Remember that the interface is the lens through which the player perceives and interacts with your game. So, they must be able to understand it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colors of the UI should stand out compared to the background, but it should also not stand out so much that it causes eye strain. There is no specific color scheme you have to use for your game, but as a general rule, split complementary color schemes are the best for reducing eye strain while also producing enough contrast to make items distinguishable.</p>
<p class="calibre3">High-contrast text will make it easier to see in different lighting. Make sure the text is appropriately sized so that it’s visible and allow the text to be resized to the user’s preference. Also, choose fonts that are clear and easy to read.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Voiceover isn’t just for dialogue! You can provide voiceover for your menus as well. Far Cry 6, for example, has an automated voice read out the various menu options on the start screen to allow those with visual impairments to still perceive the items on the screen. This option is turned on by default and does not require users to interact with a menu to access it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you’re making a console game, consider the fact that your players will have different types of TVs with different resolutions and brightness settings. Upon starting a PlayStation or Xbox game, you may have seen a prompt to adjust the brightness until an image was visible or maybe saw a prompt to move the corners of a box until they reached the edge of your screen. These prompts are safeguards to ensure that the game appears correctly to players regardless of their TV.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-56" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor062" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Tolerance of error</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The tolerance of error principle states that adverse consequences of interacting with the design should be minimized. We’ve all accidentally saved over or deleted a save file at one point <a id="_idIndexMarker108" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>in our life without meaning to because we hit the wrong button or misread the directions. The tolerance of error principle is meant to minimize these types of occurrences.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A well-designed interface doesn’t necessarily have to be convenient or easy to use. People love to click or tap quickly through things. Sometimes, we want to make that more difficult <a id="_idIndexMarker109" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>for them. The concept of <strong class="bold">designing for inconvenience</strong> involves making interfaces less convenient or more difficult to interact with. This may seem like a counterintuitive design, but if the interface that lets you delete that last save file you accidentally deleted were less convenient, perhaps your save file would still be with us.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Warning popups that ask users to double confirm a deletion, switching the location of affirmation buttons so that users don’t click quickly through things, adding timers between clicks, and requiring press and hold are all ways that we can make our interfaces slightly less convenient for the user to interact with when the consequences of interacting with it may be detrimental.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-57" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor063" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Low physical effort</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The low physical effort principle states that the design should be comfortable to use and fatigue and discomfort should be minimized. One of the guidelines for this principle states to <a id="_idIndexMarker110" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>minimize repetitive actions. This may seem impossible to do in video games, which, let’s face it, tend to require a lot of repetitive actions, but organizing your interfaces in ways that reduce clicks and mouse drags can improve the quality of your UI.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One way to reduce physical effort with your interface is to group similar actions on the screen. Don’t make users bounce back and forth on the screen. Don’t require users to jump to multiple menus when it would be easier for them to do something all in a single view menu. You can reduce mouse usage/drag by assigning actions to hotkeys or creating shortcuts. Also, allowing users to navigate through menus with arrow keys or controller buttons rather than just the mouse may be more comfortable for some users.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When designing UI in VR, the amount of physical effort needed to interact with your interface jumps exponentially compared to a game on a traditional 2D screen. Grouping similar items and allowing users to navigate menus with the controller rather than pointing will make interacting with your interface much more comfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The rumble feature can be a great way to provide feedback for your interface and gameplay, but it can also be considered uncomfortable to some players and has been purportedly linked to hand-arm vibration syndrome. If you include it, be sure to allow users to turn it off.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One frustrating <a id="_idIndexMarker111" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>interaction on a console game is entering information into a form. If you have players enter long text strings with an on-screen keyboard, having to navigate to each letter gets very tedious, very fast. Consider the possibility of allowing players to enter these long strings on their phone or computer and send the data to the game, instead of on the console.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-58" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor064" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Size and space for approach and use</h2>
<p class="calibre3">The size and space for approach and use principle states that interfaces should allow users to <a id="_idIndexMarker112" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>interact with them regardless of their mobility, size, posture, or position. This principle ties closely to the previous principle of low physical effort in that you want them to not only be able to physically <a id="_idIndexMarker113" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>interact with your interface but also do so comfortably.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When determining the keyboard layout for your game, make sure that the player does not have to stretch their hands in ways that are either impossible or uncomfortable for those with smaller hands. If you have two buttons on a controller that are frequently used together, you want to make sure that the button combination is doable. For example, you do not want to ask them to hold down both the X button and the B button on the Xbox controller at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Allowing for multiple types of input devices is key to this principle as it will allow people to use input devices designed for their specific size and mobility. For example, with a PC game, some people may find interacting with a controller easier than a keyboard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Additionally, allowing for the sensitivity of your inputs to be adjusted can help those with different mobility issues. For example, I have problems with hand pain and tremors. When I can adjust the sensitivity on controllers and mice, this makes it easier for me to interact with the game in a way that doesn’t affect gameplay and can reduce the pain I experience doing so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When designing a VR interface, don’t put UI items too high or too far away from the player’s reach. This could make it impossible for smaller players, players sitting down, or players with mobility issues to interact with your UI.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In <a href="B18327_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor024" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, we discussed the thumb zone. This is a location of the screen that can be easily reached by the player’s thumb while they’re holding their phone and where most of your <a id="_idIndexMarker114" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>interactable UI should be placed. We also want to make sure that buttons are as big as possible on mobile screens. You <a id="_idIndexMarker115" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>don’t want the buttons to be so small and so close together that those with larger hands would not be able to interact with them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we’ve reviewed the various principles of universal design, let’s look at how we could design specifically for those with impairments and disabilities.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-59" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor065" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Accessibility design</h1>
<p class="calibre3">Recall that universal design involves designing UI that is universally usable for all people. Accessibility <a id="_idIndexMarker116" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>design, on the other hand, involves designing with specific impairments and disabilities in mind. In this section, I will discuss a few very specific types of impairments and disabilities and how you can design your UI in such a way that it is accessible to individuals with these impairments and disabilities. A few of these examples will overlap with the ones that I discussed in the universal design section.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-60" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor066" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Vision</h2>
<p class="calibre3">When designing <a id="_idIndexMarker117" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>your interfaces, you should consider different types of visual impairments and disabilities, including (but not limited to) color blindness, low vision, and blindness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Essential information should never be conveyed by color alone and you should always include another way of conveying that information. For example, let’s say a game has a number that is red when negative and green when positive. That number could also have negative and positive symbols to indicate the sign. If the number represents some change, maybe it can fly up when positive and fly down with negative. This will make sure those who have color blindness will still be able to see these important pieces of information.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Whenever possible, you should avoid color combinations that will be indistinguishable for those who are color blind; if it’s not possible, use other indicators to make items distinct. For example, if you have a match three game that uses colors to indicate matchable pieces, also include symbols on the pieces to make them easier to distinguish.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The following <a id="_idIndexMarker118" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>websites offer very good information on designing accessible UI for color blindness:</p>
<ul class="calibre16">
<li class="calibre14"><a href="https://medium.com/theuxblog/how-to-design-for-color-blindness-a6f083b08e12" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://medium.com/theuxblog/how-to-design-for-color-blindness-a6f083b08e12</a></li>
<li class="calibre14"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/improving-color-accessibility-for-color-blind-users/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/improving-color-accessibility-for-color-blind-users/</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">As stated earlier in this chapter, you should make sure that your text and other UI elements have very high contrast. This makes it easier for those with color blindness and those with low vision to be able to clearly perceive your UI. The following website is an excellent resource for being able to check the contrast between two colors: <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While the preceding website shows if colors meet a contrast ratio required by web regulations, the information translates well to video games.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you have important information that only appears temporarily on the screen in the form of a popup, make sure it appears in the player’s line of sight. Placing it outside of the line of sight could be difficult for those with low peripheral vision to see. Better yet, allow the player to choose where on the screen the important information will pop up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Remember, according to the principles of universal design, choice is very important. Allow players to change settings for as many of the visual elements as possible. If your game uses a crosshair or cursor, allow the player to change the appearance of the crosshair or cursor. Allow your players to change the size of the interface or text. Allow players to change the font of the interface to one that has higher kerning or spacing or is less frilly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It’s also important to indicate information in ways that are not purely visible. For example, suppose your UI turns red to indicate your player has low health and you have a red health meter on the screen. You can also include a beeping sound and a vibration of the controller to indicate low health. This will help those with both low vision and color blindness be able to perceive the low health status.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you have input boxes, you can use speech as a way to input text, rather than just a visual keyboard for input.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Remember, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker119" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>also use a description track to describe all of the user interface elements of your game, thus allowing those with low vision and blindness to still be able to perceive what is on the screen.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-61" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor067" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Hearing and speech</h2>
<p class="calibre3">There are multiple ways in which you can make your interface accessible to those with hearing and <a id="_idIndexMarker120" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>speech impairments in disabilities. Essentially, you do not want any important information to be conveyed through sound alone and you do not want to require speech for any of your inputs. Additionally, if your UI makes any type of noise, keep overlapping noises to a minimum.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the low-health example I described previously, there were multiple ways other than just the beeping sound in which the player was made aware of the low health. If your UI includes speech input, make sure that it is not the only form of input and allows users to input information through other means.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While it might not seem like an interface design, including subtitles for all spoken dialogue, would need to be designed as a UI element. Your UI for subtitles will need to be clear and readable. Usually, you should put them in some sort of box so that they easily contrast against the background. You also want to make sure that they sync up with the spoken speech in the game.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-62" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor068" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Mobility</h2>
<p class="calibre3">When designing your interfaces, you want to make sure they are accessible for people with all levels of mobility. The best way to make your game accessible to mobility levels is to include <a id="_idIndexMarker121" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>as many options as possible for input devices, input mappings, and configurations. Allowing the player to choose for themselves how they interact with your interface might ensure that it fits their particular mobility needs.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You want your controls to be as simple as possible and require as few buttons as possible. If your controls are particularly complicated, provide alternatives that simplify the control scheme.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Additionally, don’t require the player to use an input for a small part of the game that is different than the rest of the game. For example, if most of the game is controlled by a keyboard, don’t require the start screen to be interacted with by a mouse. Allow the player to use <a id="_idIndexMarker122" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>the same input device for all aspects of the game.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-63" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor069" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Cognitive and emotional</h2>
<p class="calibre3">It’s important to consider the cognitive and emotional states of your players as well as their language skills when designing your user interface.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Don’t assume <a id="_idIndexMarker123" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>that your player can read the language in which you have created your UI or that they can read quickly. If your game contains text, use other contextual elements and images to convey the text’s intent. If you have text that displays in your UI and then goes away, allow players the ability to choose when it goes away rather than having it do so at its own speed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Use your UI to remind players of important gameplay elements and important information about how to interact with your interface. Remind your players of what the controls are by prominently displaying them in your UI. Use your UI to clearly indicate interactive elements and objectives.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Don’t place flickering images or repetitive patterns in your UI as this could be triggering to individuals prone to seizures.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While this is probably more related to your gameplay than your user interface, I would like to point out that content warnings in your games with particularly triggering content can be helpful to prepare your user for things that may cause distress. For example, many games now come with a content warning if they have upsetting content (such as Doki Doki Literature Club).</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-64" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor070" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Additional resources</h1>
<p class="calibre3">There is so much more I could say about the universal design and accessibility design aspects of user interfaces, but alas, this is not a book about designing UI it is about the development of UI. I hope this chapter at least gave you an insight into how important it is to consider these elements and how important it is to consider them at the beginning of your user interface development.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you’d like to learn more about accessibility design, I highly recommend that you review the <a id="_idIndexMarker124" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>information provided at the following website: <a href="https://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/full-list/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/full-list/</a>. It provides an extensive list of best practices related to accessibility for video games. Additionally, it provides multiple examples of best practices that you can use for reference.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can also visit <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6">https://caniplaythat.com/</a>, a website that provides information about accessibility in the gaming industry.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-65" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor071" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre6"/>Summary</h1>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we discussed some key considerations for designing your UI so that it will be as universally perceivable as possible. We discussed the principles of universal design and reviewed some considerations you can implement in your designs to improve their accessibility.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next chapter, we will leave the design discussion behind and start looking at how to implement UI. We’ll review the different interface systems available in Unity so that you can start putting some of this design knowledge to use!</p>
