    our Unity games to help improve performance. We did this by optimizing scripts,
    garbage collection, and graphic rendering. We also looked at how to deploy our
    Unity game for multiple distribution platforms.

    virtual reality. We will start with a quick introduction to virtual reality, including
    hardware requirements, and then look at how to create a virtual reality game using
    the Unity game engine. This is a bonus chapter and does not require you to own
    expensive virtual reality hardware. The purpose of the chapter is to give you
    an introduction to virtual reality and its possibilities with the Unity game engine.

    The advent of 3D graphics and stereoscopes contributed to the state of virtual
    reality as it exists today. The following diagram illustrates the basic concept

    and believable virtual environment or world. There are two basic components: hardware
    and software. The hardware components typically involve a headset that has an
    individual lens for each eye and one or more display panels behind each lens.
    Most often, we are inserting our mobile phone into the headset, instead of having
    the display panels. Specialized lenses are used to focus the light from the mobile
    phone surface onto your eye''s retina.'

    eyes at a distance of approximately 2 inches. Your eyes are not able to focus
    on the screen—it is too close. Specialized lenses allow us to see the screen that
    close.

- en: Unity Technologies, the company that makes Unity and owns the Asset Store, has
    a robust VR Samples asset package. It contains a menu and four mini-games that
    can be used to help you get started in creating virtual reality games for Oculus
    DK2 and GearVR.

- en: In this chapter, we examined Unity's capabilities in regard to virtual reality.
    We started with a quick introduction to virtual reality, including hardware requirements,
    and then looked at how to create a virtual reality game using the Unity game engine.
    We also took a look at the available starter content from the Unity Asset Store.

    games using Unity and you will have an idea of what is required to start making
    virtual reality games. You are getting started at a good time: virtual reality
    is still a very young technology. For example, the human eye requires approximately
    16,000 x 16,000 pixels per eye for a photographic-quality virtual reality experience,
    but best current VR displays provide up to 1080 x 780\. So we have a long way
    to go with this technology, and its future is promising.'
