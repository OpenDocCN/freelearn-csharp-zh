<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
<p>Thanks for acquiring this book! It was born out of the need to industrialize Information Systems. Software is everywhere but, apart from a few high-cost applications, it is full of bugs and costs a lot in maintenance, and most developers spend half their time reinventing the wheel or fighting against the Information System to add some new features.</p>
<p>This is my harsh observation from more than 25 years in the field and a few years working specifically on digital transformation for many different organizations. These diverse experiences convinced me that the root problem is always the same: the software industry does not actually follow the rules of industrialization, which are to decompose systems into smaller ones and join modules together with standards-obeying interfaces.</p>
<p>Working together with academics helped me formalize these problems of business/IT alignment, along with their sources and possible solutions. But most of my customers have told me that I stood out as a consultant because I was able to not only provide boards of directors with a clear transformation plan but also to accompany it with advice on semantics all the way down to the API contracts, and even some hands-on help in the code for the hard bits. They said this made the whole partnership more tangible and provided visible business results, so this is how I wanted this book to be: some theory first because we need to switch the way we think and create Information Systems, but some code as well because too many of them are not efficient today.</p>
<p>Having seen the positive effects on the business efficiency of many companies, from a small lawyers firm to industry/logistics enterprises and to some huge farming cooperatives, I am convinced applying industry concepts to software design and architecture will become a more and more cost-effective approach, particularly since software and data are becoming the competitive backbone of most organizations nowadays.</p>
<p>Using norms and standards for API interfaces, externalizing functions such as authentication, authorization, electronic document management, and, most importantly, thinking in terms of business functions rather than technically, is of utmost importance if you want to transform an Information System from a cost center to a strong asset of an organization.</p>
<p>This method has helped many companies and government-owned agencies, and I hope it will do the same for your Information Systems!</p>
<p>Who this book is for</p>
<p>This book aims to help you create or evolve Information Systems architecture in such a way that it becomes more flexible and provides more business value to your organization. Since it is theoretical, business-oriented, and technically applied with an application in .NET, it can be read at many levels and by many profiles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Board directors and chief officers can read the first chapters in order to understand digital transformation and how it can be strategized. Finding out about the most common problems in Information Systems should help them invest in the right places and prioritize work, taking into account not only features but also technical debt reduction when justified.</li>
<li>Tech leads, architects, and R&amp;D managers will also benefit from reading the next chapters that make the strategy more tangible and explain best practices in structuring Information Systems, choosing tools and methods, and applying alignment in their job.</li>
<li>- Finally, developers or hands-on architects and technical directors will continue reading the book's last chapters that really put the previous chapters into practice by coding the different concepts, plugging external services, and orchestrating API and webhooks together to create a small but working sample system.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B21293_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">The Sad State of Information Systems</em>, explains what prevents most Information Systems from providing as much value as they should. It also proposes some methods to measure the efficiency of an Information System, focusing on what causes are behind most of the problems observed.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Applying Industrial Principles to Software</em>, starts by explaining what characterizes the principle of industrialization, and then proposes a way to apply a transformation to Information System management. It focuses on the importance of standards and norms to reduce complexity, which is quite high in most virtual systems.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor069"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Reaching Business Alignment</em>, brings a layer of theory to the problems analyzed in the previous chapters, explaining Conway’s law and some other principles, patterns, and anti-patterns in business/IT alignment. This chapter also introduces the four-layer diagram, which will be used throughout the rest of the book.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Dealing with Time and Technical Debt</em>, describes the concept of technical debt and explains how Information Systems often start quite well adapted to their context but slowly drift apart from efficiency over time. It also reflects on how to adopt an Agile approach to architecture.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">A Utopic Perfect IT System</em>, is about setting a vision of an absolutely perfect Information System that would be completely aligned with business needs and where changes would be as easy as the original design. Even if this utopic system will never exist in reality, it will help you understand how externalizing functions and strictly separating responsibilities can make existing Information Systems more efficient and ease their evolution over time.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor212"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">SOLID Principles from Code to Systems</em>, starts a more technical set of chapters. It discusses the SOLID principles, which usually apply to code, and adapts them to systems architecture. We also present the example Information System that will serve as an applied example for the rest of the book.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor248"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">C4 and Other Approaches</em>, lists some of the most well-known architectural methods in software design and architecture. It analyzes the differences and common points between them, giving you some ways to choose which is best suited depending on the context.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor271"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Service Orientation and API</em>, starts with a historical description of all the techniques that have been used to implement the concept of a service, explaining what people expect from the concept. It will explain how standards and pivotal formats are useful in services.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor318"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring Domain-Driven Design and Semantics</em>, is about the importance of having a clear definition of the semantics of a business domain. Though this may sound a bit distant from the notion of software architecture, it actually is at the heart of the method of business/IT alignment.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor344"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Master Data Management</em>, provides a structured view of the management of data in a well-aligned Information System. Master Data Management is much more than persisting data in a database. It is about defining its life cycle and the associated governance and ensuring a progressive evolution of data management, particularly when some legacy data repositories are already in place.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor393"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Business Processes and Low Code</em>, explains the place of business processes in an Information System, and how they can be described formally using standards such as BPMN. Though this is still a theoretical chapter, it describes the tools that can be used in order to implement business process management in an Information System.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor446"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Externalization of Business Rules</em>, closes the loop on the three parts of the ideal IT system, after data and process management. It explains what a business rules management system is and shows some examples of implementations.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor470"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Externalization of Authorization</em>, explains the concept of identification and authorization management and shows how it can be externalized to the benefit of the evolution of the whole Information System. Paradigms such as <strong class="bold">Role-Based Access Control</strong> (<strong class="bold">RBAC</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Attribute-Based Access Control</strong> (<strong class="bold">ABAC</strong>) are also explained with examples.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor503"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Decomposing the Functional Responsibilities</em>, is where we start applying the knowledge from the previous chapters to an example; we’ll get our hands dirty with the code and services. The chapter starts by using the four-layer diagram to model the system and then prepares the technical specifications for the features that will be better considered in external applications.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor548"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Plugging Standard External Modules</em>, takes these specifications into account and proposes some off-the-shelf software solutions for the different features that have been identified, such as Apache Keycloak for IAM, MongoDB for persistence, Alfresco for electronic document management, and so on.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor588"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating a Write-Only Data Referential</em>, focuses on the business domain data management of the example Information System. It shows how to code an API server in .NET that will serve the data needed in a way that as far as possible respects standards and all the principles of business/IT alignment that have been described previously.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor608"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></a>, <em class="italic">Adding Query to the Data Referential Service</em>, builds on the previous chapter and adds some features to the data management system that has been put in place, but also shows how it can be tested in an industrial manner. Standards such as the Open Data Protocol are used in this chapter to improve the implementation.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_18.xhtml#_idTextAnchor622"><em class="italic">Chapter 18</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Data Referential Services</em>, shows how to deploy the services that were created in the previous chapters and how to plug them into the IAM. Since security is such an important and complex subject, this is the subject of this dedicated chapter.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_19.xhtml#_idTextAnchor634"><em class="italic">Chapter 19</em></a>, <em class="italic">Designing a Second Data Referential Service</em>, uses all the principles presented in the previous chapter to build a second API implementation, this time complexified by the fact that this service has to use webhooks and create a local cache of data in order to reduce calls to the first data referential service. Though it does not add any new principles, it does show how loose coupling can be realized in practice.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_20.xhtml#_idTextAnchor647"><em class="italic">Chapter 20</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating a Graphical User Interface</em>, adds some graphical interfaces to our example Information System, which only exposed API endpoints for now. After showcasing a web-based single-page application and explaining how the concepts and recommendations of business/IT alignment also apply in the GUI domain, it details connecting the data pagination mechanism with the backend, observing a rigorous separation of responsibilities.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_21.xhtml#_idTextAnchor674"><em class="italic">Chapter 21</em></a>, <em class="italic">Extending the Interfaces</em>, builds on the previous chapter and applies some industry standards to the GUI that was previously built, namely by automating tests on it but also by showing how importing data can be automated to migrate a system from its legacy data management. It finishes by showing how a good separation of components can help, with the right technical stack, to quickly build a mobile application.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_22.xhtml#_idTextAnchor709"><em class="italic">Chapter 22</em></a>, <em class="italic">Integrating Business Processes</em>, closes the set of chapters corresponding to the example application by explaining how business processes can be integrated into it through the GUI, a BPMN engine, or a low-code/no-code modern orchestration tool such as n8n. It finishes by explaining when a dedicated service is necessary to implement orchestration or choreography.</p>
<p><a href="B21293_23.xhtml#_idTextAnchor760"><em class="italic">Chapter 23</em></a>, <em class="italic">Applying Modifications to the System</em>, sums up the whole idea of the book by showing how the Information System that has been built can now support all kinds of changes by being impacted by side effects or losing its ability to evolve further. In this chapter, we will change the data structure, the GUI, and the business rules, particularly authorization, and even adjust the business processes, hopefully demonstrating that the initial planning of the architecture makes all this easy.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>Docker has been used in order to reduce the required tooling as much as possible. Since all images are available online (even the custom ones created for the example information system, available at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repositories/demoeditor">https://hub.docker.com/repositories/demoeditor</a>), all you need to work with the application is Docker (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ for the installation instructions). The image versions follow the branches of the code.</p>
<p>If you want to debug the application and make some changes to it in order to follow the instructions from the book, then you will also need .NET 8.0 SDK (<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download</a>), Visual Studio Code (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a>), and Git (<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a>). Postman (<a href="https://www.postman.com/">https://www.postman.com/</a>) will also be used to quickly inject data.</p>

<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-14" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Part 1: Business-Aligned Architecture and the Problems It Solves</h1>
<p>This first part of the book is not technical at all and aims to provide a good understanding of what business-/IT-alignment is all about. It explains the difficulties and shortcomings in existing information systems and how some industrialization approaches may help overcome these problems. This is useful for anyone confronted with digital transformation. People with an IT system that does not deliver on its functional promises is hard to evolve, and is not cost-effective should also get a better understanding of why this is the case. After explaining causes and symptoms, this part of the book proposes a theoretical approach in the form of a utopic system that would be free of all these shortcomings and will guide our work in the next parts.</p>
<p>This part includes the following chapters:</p>
