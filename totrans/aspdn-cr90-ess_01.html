     Introducing ASP.NET Core 9 Concepts
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Before starting to develop solutions using the ASP.NET Core 9 platform, we must learn the fundamentals and how to prepare the environment, as well as become accustomed to the main concepts that will be used during the
    
    
     
      development process.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In this chapter, we’ll learn about how to prepare our development environment, understand the differences between .NET and .NET Framework, and see what’s new in ASP.NET

     Why ASP.NET Core 9?
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     ASP.NET core
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker000">
    </a>
    
     is a platform that has existed since 2016 and has been constantly improved, allowing the development of high-performance, modern, and
    
    
     
      cloud-ready solutions.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     A few years ago, it was only possible to develop solutions on the .NET platform using the Windows operating system.
    
    
     However, with the great market demand and the rapid evolution of technologies, Microsoft began a one-way process of restructuring and redesigning the platform, adopting the open source model, which gave the developer community the opportunity to adopt a robust development model, independent of the
    
    
     
      operating system.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The last major version of ASP.NET to run exclusively on the Windows operating system was 4.x, and after the redesign, the platform was renamed
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      ASP.NET Core
     
    </em>
    
     , which is currently in version 9 STS(Standard
    
    
     
      Term Support).
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Recently, ASP.NET Core 9
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker001">
    </a>
    
     has become an extremely rich platform, enabling the delivery of solutions for different types of purposes and, what’s more, with the full support and focus of the open
    
    
     
      source community.

     However, before starting to prepare our environment and use the ASP.NET Core 9, in the next section, let’s understand how the platform has been evolving with collaboration between Microsoft and the open source community, by comparing the .NET platform and the .
    
    
     
      NET Framework.
     
    
   </p>
   <h1 id="_idParaDest-19">
    <a id="_idTextAnchor019">

     Comparing .NET and .NET Framework
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Both .NET and .NET Framework (usually called
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      Full Framework
     
    </em>
    
     ) have similarities – that is, they are
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker014">
    </a>
    
     platforms that allow us
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker015">
    </a>
    
     to deliver
    
    
     
      great solutions.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In general, the platform is a framework with a set of features that allows us to develop different types of applications.
    
    
     In February 2002, .NET Framework brought a new development model using a centralized platform, allowing us to develop applications for Windows and the web through technologies such as Windows Forms, ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC, as well as console applications, among some
    
    
     
      other extensions.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Since the first versions, it was already possible to develop applications in different languages such as C#, Visual Basic, and any other languages that implemented the .NET Framework specifications.
    
    
     However, it depended on the Windows operating system and its
    
    
     
      system APIs.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The evolution and redesign of the .NET Core platform has brought many benefits to the Microsoft ecosystem, while maintaining the main idea of being a unified platform for the development of robust solutions.
    
    
     It is possible to develop in languages such as C#, F#, or even
    
    
     
      Visual Basic.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The structuring and redesign meant that the .NET core platform, now called just .NET, was developed in a modularized manner and independent of the operating system, with the support of the open
    
    
     
      source community.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Today, the entire .NET platform ecosystem is maintained by
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker016">
    </a>
    
     the .NET Foundation (
    
    <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/">
     
      https://dotnetfoundation.org/
     
    </a>
    
     ), a non-profit, independent organization that supports the entire open source platform ecosystem.
    
    
     With that, new possibilities were created for the .NET community, including the reduction in the lead time for delivery of new versions of the framework with new features and
    
    
     
      bug fixes.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The new releases of
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker017">
    </a>
    
     the .NET platform are made available annually, every November, in STS(

    <a id="_idIndexMarker018">
    </a>
    
     odd years and receiving support for three years.
    
    
     There are also monthly patch updates, which speed up the agile correction of problems and vulnerabilities, maintaining compatibility between each patch and eliminating the greater risk
    
    
     
      of updates.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Understanding the platform update process brings great benefits to development times, as updates can cause non-conformities in applications, generating
    
    
     
      several problems.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Microsoft provides a complete roadmap of features that are added to the platform, as well as the implementation of improvements and, most importantly, fixes of bugs and vulnerabilities.

   <p>
    
     Visual Studio Code is
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker023">
    </a>
    
     a rich, extensible, and lightweight code editor that makes it possible to develop any type of application.
    
    
     It is a free tool, has several extensions, is widely used by the community, and can run on any
    
    
     
      operating system.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Conversely, Visual Studio is a more robust version of the IDE, having several visual functionalities that support development, in addition to several tools such as application profiling and a rich debug tool.
    
    
     Visual Studio only runs on the Windows operating system and a license must be purchased.
    
    
     However, Microsoft offers a version of Visual Studio called Community that is free and, despite some limitations, offers an excellent development experience.
    
    
     For the remainder of this book, we use Visual Studio Code as the main code editor, because it is extensible and, most
    
    
     
      importantly, free.

     SDK and runtime
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     When proceeding with the installation of the .NET platform on your machine, some questions may arise regarding the SDK and
    
    
     
      the runtime.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker024">
    </a>
    
     SDK allows us to develop and run ASP.NET Core 9 applications, while the runtime only has the necessary dependencies to run
    
    
     
      the applications.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In general, we always choose to use the SDK on development machines; however, when hosting environments, only the runtime is required.
    
    
     We’ll discuss hosting applications in more detail in

     CLI (Command-Line Interface)
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     Along with .NET and/or Visual Studio Code, a
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      CLI
     
    </strong>
    
     will
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker025">
    </a>
    
     also be installed that will be used extensively throughout
    
    
     
      this book.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The CLI is nothing more than software executed through the command line, allowing to you to execute tasks for different purposes, such as the
    
    
     
      following command:
     
    
   </p>
   <pre class="console">
dotnet new webapp --name hello-world</pre>
   <p>
    
     The CLI command here is called
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      dotnet
     
    </strong>
    
     .
    
    
     This command has some parameters, responsible for determining the type of task that will
    
    
     
      be executed.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In a nutshell, the previous command creates a new project (
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      new
     
    </strong>
    
     ) of type
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      webapp
     
    </strong>
    
     with the name (
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      --
     
    </strong>
    
     <strong class="source-inline">
      
       name
      
     </strong>
    
    
     
      )
     
    
    
     <strong class="source-inline">
      
       hello-world
      
     </strong>
    
    
     
      .
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     CLI tools bring great flexibility, avoid UI dependencies, are extensible, and allow us to use automation strategies
    
    
     
      through scripts.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Throughout the book, we will use some CLI commands to support solution development
    
    
     
      and learning.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In the next sections, we will look at installing the ASP.NET Core 9 SDKs for all three

     editor, code, and SDK, it’s time to create our first application and ensure that the environment is functional for the rest of
    
    
     
      the book.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In this step, we will use the Terminal or Bash, the dotnet CLI, and also Visual Studio Code as the IDE.
    
    
     We will create a simple web application using the
    
    
     
      command line.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     To do so, open a command terminal or bash and follow
    
    
     
      these instructions:
     
    
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     
      In your preferred directory, create a folder

      <strong class="source-inline">

     <pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">mkdir Projects</strong></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Access the created folder with the
     
     
      
       following command:
      
     
     <pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">cd projects</strong></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Now, run the
     
     
      
       following command:
      
     
     <pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">dotnet new</strong></pre>
     <p class="list-inset">
      
       The

       When running it, the following instructions
      
      
       
        are displayed:

   </p>
   <ol>
    <li value="4">
     
      As in Visual Studio, the .NET CLI has some templates that are used when creating projects.
     
     
      You will be able to see the templates installed on your machine by typing the
     
     
      
       highlighted command:
      
     
    </li>
   </ol>
   <div><div><img alt="Figure 1.4 – The available dotnet templates" src="img/B21788_01_4.jpg"/>

    <li value="5">
     
      We will continue with the creation of a web application in the MVC template.
     
     
      To do this, run the
     
     
      
       following command:
      
     
     <pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">dotnet new mvc --name my-first-app</strong></pre>

       The previous
      
      <a id="_idIndexMarker044">
      </a>
      
       command is basically a template for the type of project that will be created.
      
      
       In this case, we will use the MVC model, which is a project that uses
      
      <a id="_idIndexMarker045">
      </a>
      
       the

       Don’t worry about these details at this point.
      
      
       We will learn more about the .NET CLI tool, project models, and the MVC model throughout
      
      
       
        the book.
       
      
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Now, access the directory of the created application with the
     
     
      
       following command:
      
     
     <pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">cd my-first-app</strong></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Next, let’s open Visual Studio Code to make some changes to the application’s source code with the
     
     
      
       following command:
      
     
     <pre class="source-code">

     Summary
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     In this chapter, we learned about the .NET platform and ASP.NET Core 9, available in the main operating systems.
    
    
     We learned the differences between the .NET and .NET Framework, in addition to learning about the process of updating the framework versions and the difference between the STS and LTS versions.
    
    
     We also configured our development environment on different operating systems and developed an ASP.NET MVC application, validating the entire working
    
    
     
      environment .
