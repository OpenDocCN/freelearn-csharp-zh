    some tools to be ready to start. We will use Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 to design
    our sample reporting application, Crystal Reports to design the reports, Microsoft
    SQL Server 2008 as the database engine, and Northwind as a sample database. We
    will have to install all these applications before we get started.
