- en: In this section, we will create a framework for building AR applications with
    Unity and AR Foundation. Having such a framework generalizes some of the scene
    structure that I have found myself repeating from one project to the next. The
    framework manages user interaction modes, user interface panels, and AR onboarding
    graphics, and we will save it as a template for reuse in other projects in this
    book. Then, we will show you how to use this framework in a simple place-on-plane
    project with a main menu.
