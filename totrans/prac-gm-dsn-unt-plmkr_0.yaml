- en: Historically, game design has been a broad term. It is still often associated
    uniquely with creating the rules of a game, establishing a system, defining what
    the game will be in broad brushstrokes and then creating particular gameplay scenarios
    or levels. Sometimes, we go a little farther and endow game designers with the
    power to define how the game's universe and aesthetics will work. Broad as this
    definition might seem, it remains very limited in one area, and that is technology.

- en: As the game industry moves toward its maturation, many small studios begin to
    emerge, often teams of one, two, or three individuals, attributing their success
    to the new generation of tools now available to game developers. While the larger
    game companies employing hundreds of developers have mostly been able to stand
    their ground, in this new landscape, the focus has already shifted toward polyvalence
    and self-sufficiency.

- en: Game designers have always wanted more control over the games that they make,
    and, for the first time in history, there is no reason why they should not reach
    out and take it. Knowing how your game works on the inside means having more control
    and creative freedom. It also means more effective communication with other members
    of the team, provided there are any. It empowers you to go ahead and simply make
    the game on your own, be it a mere prototype, a game jam project, or a full commercial
    release.

- en: Unity 3D is a game authoring tool that has changed the way we think about game
    development forever, making it much cheaper and more democratic. It allows anyone
    willing to invest their time into it to craft amazing game worlds and experiences
    for next to nothing. It has been one of the major forces driving this incredible
    change, with millions of new developers joining the game industry simply because
    they can now. The industry becomes more open every day, which enriches the pool
    of ideas that people bring to it from different backgrounds.

- en: This book is an introduction to practical game design using Unity and Playmaker
    by Hutong Games. The latter lets anyone make a game without writing any programming
    code, while not giving up any of the power that Unity has to offer. Knowing the
    basics of programming is still valuable while working on the technical side of
    a game, but going deep into it is no longer an imperative, which means that creating
    a game is now easier than it has ever been before.

- en: Even if you know how to code, learning how to use Playmaker in Unity may help
    you see the synergy between your game's mechanics and technology more clearly,
    making the development of your project more about finding the right design and
    less about working around the computer code.
