    of users who access the platform around the clock. When unexpected issues arise,
    it can be incredibly difficult to diagnose, recreate, and resolve these problems.
    Monitoring and logging are essential tools that can address this challenge by
    providing invaluable insights into the health and performance of applications
    that are running in production environments and being used for real.

    by collecting and analyzing key metrics in real time. This is a “top-down” view
    of the overall health of the entire system, including things such as resource
    utilization. This process enables developers to identify potential issues, optimize
    resource utilization, and maintain a seamless user experience. Technologies such
    as Application Insights and Azure Monitor offer tailored solutions to effectively
    implement monitoring strategies in SaaS applications, ensuring reliability and
    high performance.

- en: Conversely, logging is vital for capturing a wide range of events occurring
    within an application. Logging is a bit more fine-grained than monitoring, and
    will generally capture issues and events that have occurred in the code of the
    application. Detailed information about errors, user actions, and system events
    allows developers to effectively diagnose and troubleshoot issues while maintaining
    a comprehensive audit trail for security and compliance purposes. By leveraging
    logging libraries, developers can seamlessly integrate logging into their SaaS
    applications.

    insight into any issues that arise in the application, and so typically, monitoring
    and logging techniques are used to keep track of what is happening in real time.

    guesswork and is a hugely time-consuming and frustrating exercise.

    and its components from an external perspective, including app services, networking,
    and databases. It provides a high-level view of the system’s operation and identifies
    potential issues and bottlenecks. Monitoring is generally proactive and can be
    used to identify issues before they arise, such as a storage device running out
    of space or the available bandwidth starting to approach its limit. You can think
    of monitoring as a top-down process that is outside of the application looking
    in. Monitoring is outside looking in.

    about the events, errors, and transactions occurring within the application code
    itself. This detailed data helps developers to diagnose, troubleshoot, and understand
    specific issues related to the application’s inner workings. So, while monitoring
    offers a broader, outside-in perspective, logging delves into the finer aspects
    of the application code and records its behavior. Logging is always retroactive.
    It is a store of things that have already happened in the application. You can
    think of logging as a more fine-grained process that is backed up in the application,
    reporting events and actions to some external store of such actions. Logging is
    inside looking out.

    consumes system resources such as CPU, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth.
    By monitoring resource consumption, developers can detect and prevent issues related
    to resource contention or exhaustion, which can negatively impact the performance
    and stability of the application. This insight also aids in making informed decisions
    about scaling and infrastructure management. In the cloud-first world we now work

    sources, such as applications, databases, and a collection of microservices or
    containers. The ability to do this efficiently is the foundation of any successful
    logging strategy. A well-designed log collection system should be able to handle
    the diverse types and volumes of log data generated by your application while
    minimizing the impact on application performance. Ensure that all relevant log
    data is captured and available for analysis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    easily accessible location. Effective log storage strategies focus on data retention,
    ensuring that log data is preserved for an appropriate length of time and can
    be quickly retrieved when needed. Scalability is also a crucial consideration,
    as log storage systems must be able to grow to accommodate increasing data volumes
    as your SaaS application expands. Do not underestimate the amount of data that
    can be collected by the logging system! Plan accordingly, as the data can be very
    expensive to store in cloud infrastructure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no point in gathering and storing the data if it is hard to get any
    usable information out of the logs. A system should be in place to allow relevant
    parties to read and analyze the log data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
    This can help developers diagnose and troubleshoot issues more effectively, optimize
    resource utilization, and even identify potential security threats – hopefully
    before they have occurred! To facilitate quick insights and decision-making, it’s
    important to present log data in an easily digestible format, such as as charts,
    graphs, and dashboards. Log visualization tools such as Kibana, Grafana, and Azure
    Monitor can help transform raw log data into meaningful visual representations,
    making it easier for developers and operations teams to understand the state of
    the application and identify areas for improvement. These tools can also be customized
    to create tailored visualizations that highlight the most relevant information
    for your specific SaaS application.

    to filter out irrelevant or noisy log data and focus on the most critical and
    actionable information. Log-filtering techniques can be employed at various stages
    of the logging process, from collection to analysis, to help reduce noise and
    improve the signal-to-noise ratio. By implementing effective log-filtering strategies,
    developers can save time and resources by concentrating on the most pertinent
    log data and ensuring that important events do not get lost in the noise.

    aspect of logging, as it involves compliance with data protection regulations

    Monitoring and logging in a multi-tenant environment require careful attention
    to ensure the appropriate isolation of tenant data and to track tenant-specific
    performance metrics. Developers need to design monitoring and logging strategies
    that can effectively identify issues affecting specific tenants while maintaining
    data privacy and compliance. As we discussed in [*Chapter 3*](B19343_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082),
    maintaining data isolation in a multi-tenant system is both difficult and of the
    utmost importance. Systems that centralize data collection, such as monitoring

    infrastructure challenging, as there could be many different services in the microservice
    constellation, each with its own requirements. Debugging runtime errors in a microservice

    be designed to adapt to changes in scale, ensuring that they can continue to provide
    accurate and timely insights even as the application grows. This includes monitoring
    resource consumption, load balancing, and auto-scaling capabilities to maintain
    optimal performance and resource allocation. The logging system should also be

    Monitoring and logging systems need to be designed with compliance in mind, capturing
    security-related metrics, events, and audit trails to demonstrate adherence to
    these requirements. Compliance may also dictate specific logging retention policies,
    access control measures, and encryption practices to protect sensitive information.
    By integrating compliance-focused monitoring and logging practices into your SaaS
    application, you not only safeguard your customers’ data and privacy but also
    mitigate potential legal and financial risks associated with non-compliance.'

    This focus helps developers proactively identify potential security threats, maintain
    compliance with industry standards and regulations, and ensure that tenant-specific
    logging requirements or preferences are met, such as log levels, data retention
