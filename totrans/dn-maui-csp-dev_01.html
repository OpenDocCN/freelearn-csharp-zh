			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Assembling Your Tools and Creating Your First App</h1>
			<p>In this book, we’ll be building iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac applications using one common code base. Everything you need is free unless you want to build for iOS and Mac, in which case you need a Mac computer. I’m going to assume you have a Mac, but if you don’t, very little will change; you’ll just be more limited in the platforms you can deploy to.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">An alternative if you don’t have a Mac</p>
			<p class="callout">James Montemagno of Microsoft has a workaround video if you don’t have a Mac. There are severe limitations, but needs must. My personal recommendation is that if you don’t have a Mac, do your development with Android. Here’s the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snQ1C6Cppr8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snQ1C6Cppr8</a>.</p>
			<p>In the coming chapters, you will see a non-trivial .NET MAUI project that we will build incrementally. Along the way, we will examine how to create the <strong class="bold">User Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI</strong>) with <strong class="bold">XAML</strong> (a markup language) and <strong class="bold">C#</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">MAUI Blazor</p>
			<p class="callout">An alternative, not covered in this book, is to use MAUI Blazor, which allows you to create a cross-platform application using your Blazor skills. You can learn more about MAUI Blazor at <a href="https://bit.ly/MauiBlazor">https://bit.ly/MauiBlazor</a>.</p>
			<p>In the first part of the book, we will discuss the principal architecture for .NET MAUI: <strong class="bold">Model-View-ViewModel</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVVM</strong>). We will then dive into the diverse controls available for creating powerful UIs followed by a chapter dedicated to techniques for laying out these controls on the page.</p>
			<p>We will move on to discussing the Shell navigation architecture and how you move from page to page, passing along data as needed. We’ll look at persisting data and then stop to discuss the all-important topic of testing your code.</p>
			<p>While .NET MAUI provides a cornucopia of controls, there are times when you need something that Microsoft did not anticipate, so we’ll dedicate a chapter to creating custom controls. (Once you have a custom control, you can use it in any subsequent .NET MAUI projects you work on.)</p>
			<p>In the final section of the book, we’ll look at consuming a REST API and creating a web frontend to the same REST API we used for the mobile and desktop applications, this time using <strong class="bold">Blazor</strong>.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to get and install Visual Studio for writing the program and Git for managing and safeguarding your code. Each chapter’s final code will be in a dedicated branch, with the final product in the main branch.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will find the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A description of Visual Studio, along with installation instructions</li>
				<li>A description of Git, along with installation instructions</li>
				<li>A description of how to create your first, out-of-the-box program, and a tour of the files in that project</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">App versus application</p>
			<p class="callout">Since we will be building for iOS and Android (which refer to apps) and also Windows and Mac (which refer to applications), I’ll be using the two terms interchangeably.</p>
			<p>Let’s get the software you need, and then set up Visual Studio.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow along with this chapter and book, you will need to obtain and install Visual Studio and Git. To do this, you will need a Windows machine (Windows 10 or later). In addition, if you want to write for iOS and/or the Mac, you will need an Apple computer on the same network as your Windows computer.</p>
			<p>All of the code in this book is available at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/.NET-MAUI-for-C-Sharp-Developers">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/.NET-MAUI-for-C-Sharp-Developers</a>. The code for each chapter will have its own branch and that will be noted in the <em class="italic">Technical requirements</em> section of the given chapter. Note that there is no code for <em class="italic">Chapters 1</em> and <em class="italic">2</em>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">A word on Visual Studio Mac</p>
			<p class="callout">It should be possible to follow along with this book using Visual Studio Mac, but some of the menus and certainly many of the keystrokes will be different. In my experience, Visual Studio Mac follows Visual Studio with a short delay in the implementation of new features. If all you have is a Mac, by all means do your development there. If you have both, or just a Windows machine, you’ll find it a bit easier to follow along with Visual Studio (for Windows).</p>
			<p class="callout">While I’m at it, I’ll mention that I’m using Windows 11 on a desktop computer with 64 GB of memory and a 1 TB disk. None of that is required for this book. You will want at least 16 GB of memory for .NET MAUI programming.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Getting and installing Visual Studio</h1>
			<p>The first and<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> foremost<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> software you’ll need for this book is the latest version of Visual Studio from Microsoft. You can, of course, write .NET and .NET MAUI apps with any number of editors<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> and/or <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environments</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDEs</strong>), but Visual Studio is what I’ll be using in this book because it is, I believe, the most powerful IDE for the job. All the examples will use Visual Studio and your job will be much easier if you do so as well, at least while working your way through this book.</p>
			<p>To get Visual Studio, open a browser and navigate to <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/</a>. Microsoft changes the appearance of this page pretty frequently, but you should see the opportunity to download <strong class="bold">Visual Studio</strong>, <strong class="bold">Visual Studio for Mac</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Visual </strong><strong class="bold">Studio Code</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Installing Visual Studio</h2>
			<p>On the <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>website, click on <strong class="bold">Download Visual Studio</strong>. You can download whichever version you prefer. Note that the Community Version is free. If you already have Visual Studio 2022 or later installed, you need not add another copy, though they will run side by side assuming you have enough disk space. For installation, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Once Visual Studio has been downloaded, click on the executable to begin the installation process. The installer will update and you will be presented with the <strong class="bold">Workloads</strong> dialog box as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.1</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.1_B19723.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 – Visual Studio Workloads&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – Visual Studio Workloads</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Visual Studio lets you pick and choose what workloads you’ll need so that it is no bigger than necessary. Be sure to check <strong class="bold">Azure development</strong>, .<strong class="bold">NET Multi-platform App UI development</strong>, and <strong class="bold">.NET desktop development</strong> as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.2.</em></li>
			</ol>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2 – Selecting workloads</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Next, click <strong class="bold">Install</strong> and get<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> yourself a cup of coffee; this may take a few minutes. You should see progress in the Visual Studio installer, as in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.3</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.3_B19723.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3 – Visual Studio Installer&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p>When the installation is complete, Visual Studio will open.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">A word on ReSharper</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">ReSharper</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> very powerful tool that greatly enhances productivity for .NET developers. It is not free, however, and while I use it every day in my own work, we’ll not be using it in this book. Since we can do everything in Visual Studio without ReSharper (though it may take a few more keystrokes), no harm done.</p>
			<p>With Visual Studio installed, the only remaining issue is storing, safeguarding, and retrieving the source<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> code. For that, we’ll use <strong class="bold">Git</strong> – the industry standard. The final application will be in the main branch, with each chapter’s code being in a dedicated branch.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Git</h1>
			<p>The next software you<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> need is Git. To download <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>Git, navigate to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download ">git-scm.com/download </a>and choose your operating system. I’ll choose Windows. Next, I’ll choose <strong class="bold">64-bit Git for Windows Setup</strong> under <strong class="bold">Standalone Installer</strong>. This will cause an immediate download. Double-click on the downloaded file to install it. If you already have Git installed, this will update it.</p>
			<p>You do not need any of the Git GUIs, as we’ll be interacting with Git through Visual Studio.</p>
			<p>When the installation is complete, you’ll see the following options: <strong class="bold">Launch Git Bash</strong> and <strong class="bold">View the release notes</strong>. Uncheck both and click on <strong class="bold">Finish</strong>.</p>
			<p>Let’s continue with our exploration of Visual Studio.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Opening Visual Studio</h1>
			<p>You’ll need to<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> obtain the rest of the software from within Visual Studio, so let’s open that next. If the installation went as expected, the launch dialog will be on the screen:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">Create a new project</strong>. (If you’ve been brought directly into Visual Studio, bypassing the launch dialog, just click <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Project</strong>.)</li>
				<li>It is now time to pick the template we want. Templates make getting started easier. In the <code>MAUI</code>. A few choices will be presented; you want <strong class="bold">.NET MAUI App</strong>, as shown in the following figure:</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="3">Click <code>ForgetMeNotDemo</code> (the project that you will be building as part of this book), but rather a sample project just to take a quick look around. Name it something creative such as <code>SampleApp</code> and place it in a location on your disk where you will be able to easily find it later. Before clicking <strong class="bold">Next</strong>, make sure your dialog looks similar to <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.5</em>.</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="4">Click <strong class="bold">Next</strong> and use <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>the dropdown to choose the latest version of .NET. At the time of writing, that is .NET 7. Finally, click on <strong class="bold">Create</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Because Microsoft is always updating Visual Studio, your screens or steps may vary slightly. Don’t let that worry you. The version I am using is Visual Studio 2022, version 17.4.3. As long as yours is the same or later, you’re all set. But just to be sure, let’s launch the sample app (<em class="italic">F5</em>). You should see something that looks like <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.6</em>.</p>

			</ol>
			<p>Generally speaking, I will not be walking through how to do simple things on Visual Studio. The assumption is that you are a C# programmer and so you are probably familiar with Visual Studio. On the other hand, on the off chance that you are not, I’ll describe how to do anything that is not immediately intuitive. Next, let’s explore the out-of-the-box app in a bit more detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Quick tour of the app</h2>
			<p>Let’s take a quick tour <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>to see what comes with an out-of-the-box app. First, stop the app by pressing the red square button in the menu bar. Make sure <strong class="bold">Solution Explorer</strong> is open (if not, go to <strong class="bold">View</strong> | <strong class="bold">Solution Explorer</strong>). Notice that there are three folders and four files, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.7</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.7_B19723.jpg" alt="Figure 1.7 – Three folders and four files&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.7 – Three folders and four files</p>
			<p>The files with the <code>.xaml</code> extension are XAML files – that is, they use the XAML markup language. I will not assume you know XAML, and in fact, throughout this book, I will provide layout and other code in both XAML and fluent C#, but that is for the next chapter.</p>
			<p>Right now, let’s open <code>this out of the </code><code>box project</code>.</p>
			<p>This is the entry point for the program. As you can see, it is a static class with a static method that is responsible for creating the app itself. We’ll come back to this file in subsequent chapters.</p>
			<p>When you open <code>MainPage.xaml</code>, you will see a layout with controls for the page we just looked at (with the goofy MAUI guy waving and counting our button clicks). Again, we’re going to come back to layout and controls, but scan this page and see whether you can guess what is going on. You may find that it isn’t as alien as it seemed at first glance. You can, if you are so motivated, learn quite a bit about XAML just by reading this page carefully.</p>
			<p>Click on the triangle next to <code>MainPage.xaml</code> to reveal the code-behind file. Code-behind files are always named <code>&lt;PageName&gt;.xaml.cs</code> – in this case, <code>MainPage.xaml.cs</code>. These files are always in C#. Here, we see the constructor and then an event handler. When the user clicks on the button, this event handler (<code>OnCounterClicked</code>) is called.</p>
			<p>By flipping back and forth between the XAML and the code-behind file, you may be able to figure out how the button works and how the count of clicks is displayed. No need to do this, however, as we’ll be covering all these details in upcoming chapters.</p>
			<p>At the moment, most of the other files are nearly empty and not worth the time to examine.</p>
			<p>Just for fun, expand the <code>Resources</code> folder. You’ll see that there are folders for the application icon, fonts, images, and so forth. All the resources for all of the platforms are kept here.</p>
			<p>Then there is a <code>Platforms</code> folder, which contains whatever is needed on a per-platform basis. For example, iOS applications require an <code>info.plist</code> file, which you’ll find in <strong class="bold">Platforms</strong> | <strong class="bold">iOS</strong>.</p>
			<p>There is much more<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> to see in a .NET MAUI application, but we will tackle each part as we build Forget Me Not™.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you saw how to find, download, and install Visual Studio and Git, the two tools you’ll need throughout the book. You also created your first .NET MAUI app, and we walked through some of its files, albeit quickly.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we’ll take an extended look at XAML: the markup language for page layout and the creation of controls. We’ll then look at creating layouts and controls in C# and a new library that allows us to use Fluent C# to create layouts and controls.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Quiz</h1>
			<p>Test your understanding of this chapter by answering the following questions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>How do you create a new project?</li>
				<li>How do you find <strong class="bold">Solution Explorer</strong> if it is not visible?</li>
				<li>What does the <code>.xaml</code> extension indicate?</li>
				<li>What do we call the <code>.cs</code> file associated with an <code>.</code><code>xaml</code> file?</li>
				<li>Where is the entry point for a .NET MAUI app?</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>You try it</h1>
			<p>Most chapters will have a <em class="italic">You try it</em> section, in which you will be encouraged to take on a task related to what was covered in the chapter. Alas, this chapter does not have a task for you.</p>
