- en: This book covers the most common design patterns and frameworks involved in
    software architecture. It discusses when and how to use each pattern by providing
    you with practical real-world scenarios. This book also presents techniques and
    processes such as DevOps, microservices, continuous integration, and cloud computing
    so that you can have a best-in-class software solution developed and delivered
    for your customers.

- en: This book will help you to understand the product that your customer wants from
    you. It will guide you to deliver and solve the biggest problems you could face
    during development. It also covers the do's and don'ts that you need to follow
    when you manage your application in a cloud-based environment. You will learn
    about different architectural approaches, such as layered architectures, service-oriented
    architecture, microservices, and cloud architecture, and understand how to apply
    them to specific business requirements. Finally, you will deploy code in remote
    environments or on the cloud using Azure.

    practical use cases where design principles make the difference when creating
    safe and robust applications. By the end of the book, you will be able to develop
    and deliver highly scalable enterprise-ready applications that meet the end customers'
    business needs.
