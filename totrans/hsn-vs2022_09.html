			<h1 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Chapter 7: Coding Efficiently with AI and Code Views</h1>
			<p>Artificial intelligence is a vast and interesting field that allows us to improve our lifestyle in one way or another. We see, hear, and use it every day, and if you don't believe it, ask yourself how many times you use the Google search engine throughout the day. Other places where you can find it are in photo-editing programs, where it is possible to remove, for example, the background of an image in an almost perfect way. Social networks are another perfect example of the use of artificial intelligence, as they are constantly processing the best recommendations for you to stay on them as long as possible.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, artificial intelligence has even reached new software development tools, through predictive code integration, which allows us to choose the pieces of code we need at the right time. In Visual Studio, we have a powerful feature called <strong class="bold">Visual Studio IntelliCode</strong> that does this.</p>
			<p>Similarly, we have different visual tools and windows that can help us find relationships in our code and navigate through them efficiently.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding CodeLens</li>
				<li>Working with code views</li>
				<li>Using Visual Studio IntelliCode</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To use IntelliCode, Visual Studio 2022 with the web development workload must be installed. Because this chapter focuses more on showing auto-completion and class display features, no changes have been made to the code repositories. You can use the repository hosted at the following URL: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Visual-Studio-2022/tree/main/Chapter07">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Visual-Studio-2022/tree/main/Chapter07</a>.</p>
			<p>Also, to be able to perform the procedure of the <em class="italic">Code maps</em> section, it is required to use the Enterprise version of Visual Studio.</p>
			<p>Likewise, the <strong class="bold">Code Map</strong> and <strong class="bold">Live Dependency Validation</strong> tools must be installed by the Visual Studio Installer, selecting them as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.1</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer145" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1 – Installation of the Code Map and Live Dependency Validation features</p>
			<p>Now that we know the technical requirements, let's learn how to work with them to get the most out of Visual Studio.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Understanding CodeLens</h1>
			<p>CodeLens<a id="_idIndexMarker289"/> is a powerful set of tools that is useful for finding references in code, relationships between your different components, seeing the history of changes in the code, linked bugs, code reviews, unit tests, and so on.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will analyze the most important tools of this feature. Let's start by seeing how we can find references in our code.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Finding references in code</h2>
			<p>CodeLens <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>is presented in our code files from the first time we use Visual Studio. We can check this by going to any class, method, or property and verifying that a sentence appears, indicating the number of references in the project about it. In <em class="italic">Figure 7.2</em>, we can see that we have opened the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecastController.cs</strong> file, which shows us that three references have been found for the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecastController</strong> class:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer146" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.02_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2 – References for the WeatherForecastController class&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.2 – References for the WeatherForecastController class</p>
			<p>This means that the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecastController</strong> class is being used in three places in our project. If we proceed by clicking on the legend titled <strong class="bold">3 references</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.2</em>, we will see all references that use this class. In <em class="italic">Figure 7.3</em>, continuing with the example, we can see that it is used within the same class in which we are – that is, the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecastController</strong> class – specifically in the <strong class="bold">14</strong> and <strong class="bold">16</strong> lines:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer147" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.03_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.3 – The location in the code of the references in the WeatherForecastController class&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.3 – The location in the code of the references in the WeatherForecastController class</p>
			<p>Not only that, but we can also position over on any of the lines found, which will show us a section of the four closest lines of code surrounding the reference. This way, we can get a better idea of the purpose of using it, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.4</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer148" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.4_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.4 – A preview of a found code reference&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.4 – A preview of a found code reference</p>
			<p>This is quite<a id="_idIndexMarker291"/> useful if we are in a new project and need to quickly know what certain parts of the code do.</p>
			<p>Now, let's see a utility belonging to CodeLens that will allow you to see relationships between code visually.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Sometimes, even if the number of references equals zero, there may be references to other GUI files, such as <strong class="source-inline">.xaml</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">.aspx</strong> files.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Code maps</h2>
			<p>Code maps<a id="_idIndexMarker292"/> are a way to visualize relationships in code in a fast and efficient way. This tool allows the creation, as its name indicates, of visual maps from the code. With this tool, we will be able to see the structure of the entities, their different properties, and relationships, which lets us know how much impact a change we make can have.</p>
			<p>There are several ways to <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>create code maps. The first one is by selecting the option <strong class="bold">Architecture</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Code Map</strong>. This will open a new document with a <strong class="source-inline">.dgml</strong> extension, in which we will be instructed to drag files from the solution explorer, class view, or object browser, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.5</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer149" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.05_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.5 – The empty code map file&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.5 – The empty code map file</p>
			<p>Let's <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>do a test – click on the <strong class="bold">Class View</strong> link to open the class window and then expand the <strong class="source-inline">SPAProject.Controllers</strong> namespace. This will show you the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecastController</strong> class, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.6</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer150" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.06_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.6 – A visualization of the WeatherForecastController class, about to be dragged into the code map file"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.6 – A visualization of the WeatherForecastController class, about to be dragged into the code map file</p>
			<p>Next, drag<a id="_idIndexMarker295"/> the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecastController</strong> class into the code map file. This will automatically generate a graph where we can see the dragged <strong class="source-inline">class</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">namespace</strong> that contains it, and finally, <strong class="source-inline">.dll</strong> in which it is hosted, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.7</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer151" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.07_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.7 – The WeatherForecastController class in the code map&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.7 – The WeatherForecastController class in the code map</p>
			<p>Additionally, if we expand the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecastController</strong> class in the diagram, we will see the members that are part of the class, such as its attributes and behavior, as well as the relationships that can be found as part of the same class:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer152" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.08_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.8 – The relationships found through the code map&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.8 – The relationships found through the code map</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 7.8</em>, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>see in action a code map of the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecastController</strong> class with all its members expanded. This shows us quickly how the fields, properties, and methods are related.</p>
			<p>Another way to create a map code from the source code is to go to the file where the member we are interested in is located, such as the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecast.cs</strong> file. Once we have opened the file, we can position the cursor on a class, method, property, or field and right-click, which will show us the <strong class="bold">Code Map</strong> | <strong class="bold">Show on Code Map</strong> option, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.9</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer153" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.09_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.9 – The option to add a class to a code map from the context menu of a class&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.9 – The option to add a class to a code map from the context menu of a class</p>
			<p>This option will <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>create a new <strong class="source-inline">.dgml</strong> file or, if you have already created one, as in our case, add the reference with its respective relations in the previously opened file.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you want to center the code map diagram, at any time you can click on any empty area of the diagram to center it. Likewise, if you double-click on any of the entities or members of the diagram, the corresponding code will open to view it next to the diagram.</p>
			<p>As a result of adding the new class to the diagram, we can see that the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecast</strong> class is being used in the <strong class="source-inline">Get</strong> method of the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecastController</strong> class, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.10</em>. This way, we have discovered this relationship very easily:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer154" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.10_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.10 – The relationships between classes by code map&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.10 – The relationships between classes by code map</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The arrows indicating relationships between entities in the code map diagram appear and disappear as entities are selected, allowing more space and understanding of the diagram. I encourage you to select each of the elements in the diagram so that you can see the complete relationship.</p>
			<p>Finally, if we want to be <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>able to see the relationships in our solution without having to add entity by entity, from the <strong class="bold">Architecture</strong> menu, we can select the <strong class="bold">Generate Code Map for Solution</strong> option, as we can see in <em class="italic">Figure 7.11</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer155" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.11_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.11 – The option in the menu to generate a code map at a solution level&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.11 – The option in the menu to generate a code map at a solution level</p>
			<p>This will start the<a id="_idIndexMarker299"/> process of generating the respective code map for the entire solution. Depending on the number of references in your code, the process may take more or less time.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Although code maps can only be created in Visual Studio Enterprise Edition, it is possible to view them from any version of Visual Studio, including the Community version, but it is not possible to edit them from any version except the Enterprise Edition.</p>
			<p>Now that we have seen how CodeLens can help us understand our code better and faster, let's look at the windows available in Visual Studio, which will allow us to work with our code easily.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Working with code views</h1>
			<p>In addition to CodeLens, there<a id="_idIndexMarker300"/> are several windows that can help us to examine the classes of a project and its members in a quicker way. In this section, you are going to learn about them and how they can help you in breaking down code of a project in Visual Studio.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>Class view</h2>
			<p>The class view<a id="_idIndexMarker301"/> is a window that allows you to see the elements of a Visual Studio project, such <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>as namespaces, types, interfaces, enumerations, and classes, allowing you to access each of these elements quickly. Perhaps if you have worked with small projects in Visual Studio, you might not see it as being of much use. But if, like me, you work with solutions that can have up to 20 projects or more, then it is an excellent option to examine code.</p>
			<p>To access this<a id="_idIndexMarker303"/> window, you must select the <strong class="bold">View</strong> | <strong class="bold">Class View</strong> option from the menu, which will display the <strong class="bold">Class View</strong> window, showing all the elements of the solution that is currently open, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.12</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer156" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.12_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.12 – The Class View window with a loaded project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.12 – The Class View window with a loaded project</p>
			<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker304"/> can see, we can get a very quick idea of the structure of our project by seeing at a glance the namespaces into which the project has been divided. If we expand the nodes of each of the namespaces, we can also see the different classes that are part of these namespaces, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.13</em>: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer157" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.13_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.13 – The Class View window displaying the members of the WeatherForecastController class&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.13 – The Class View window displaying the members of the WeatherForecastController class</p>
			<p>In addition, if we select any element of our project, such as a class, we will be able to see the properties and methods that compose it in the lower part of the window (as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.13</em>).</p>
			<p>Another great<a id="_idIndexMarker305"/> advantage of this window is that you don't even have to recompile<a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> the project to see the changes, as they will be made automatically and instantly.</p>
			<p>At the top of the window in <em class="italic">Figure 7.13</em>, we can also see a series of buttons that we can use to create new folders, navigate between the selected elements, configure the display options, and possibly add a class to a code map file.</p>
			<p>It is certainly an excellent window to navigate between the classes of our project, but what if we want to navigate between classes that are not part of our project? In this case, the object browser can help us, which we will examine next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>The object browser</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>object browser<a id="_idIndexMarker308"/> is a very useful window that has been present since the beginning of Visual Studio. This window contains information about all the assemblies that are used in your project and allows you to examine them in depth. To access this window, we can do it from the <strong class="bold">View</strong> | <strong class="bold">Object Browser</strong> menu.</p>
			<p>Once we select the <strong class="bold">Object Browser</strong> option, it will open and load the assemblies that are used as part of our solution. We can see that the list of assemblies is quite long, and this is because we can examine assemblies that are part of the framework we are using and also the assemblies that we have created ourselves, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.14</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer158" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.14_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.14 – The Object Browser window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.14 – The Object Browser window</p>
			<p>As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.15</em>, at the top there is a filter, which we can deploy to choose which framework or set of libraries we want to examine: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer159" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.15_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.15 – Displaying the object browser options to navigate between the different classes&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.15 – Displaying the object browser options to navigate between the different classes</p>
			<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker309"/> list (in the preceding screenshot) will vary, according to the<a id="_idIndexMarker310"/> workloads picked in the Visual Studio installation.</p>
			<p>You will also have a powerful search engine available, in which you can enter a search term, and it will return all possible matches, including any type of data that has been found, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.16</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer160" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.16_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.16 – Performing a search in the object browser&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.16 – Performing a search in the object browser</p>
			<p>Finally, if you <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>select any item from the list, you will see a second list on <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>the right panel, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.17</em>, which will contain all the members of the selected type, such as their methods, properties, structures, enumerations, among other available types, and at the bottom, a description of the selected member:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer161" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.17_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.17 – Showing the members of a class in the object browser&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.17 – Showing the members of a class in the object browser</p>
			<p>As you can see, this<a id="_idIndexMarker313"/> window is quite helpful, not only to see members of your <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>own project but also of the whole framework in general.</p>
			<p>Now, let's look at a new feature called IntelliCode, which will allow us to write code more efficiently.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Using Visual IntelliCode</h1>
			<p>IntelliCode is the<a id="_idIndexMarker315"/> tool integrated into Visual Studio 2022, which allows you to write code faster, thanks to artificial intelligence. It is a tool that has been trained with thousands of popular open source projects hosted on GitHub, and although it was already beginning to show a little of its potential in Visual Studio 2019, it is in this version where all the features have been implemented.</p>
			<p>IntelliCode can<a id="_idIndexMarker316"/> suggest patterns and styles while you write code, giving you accurate suggestions according to the context in which you find yourself, so you can complete lines of code. IntelliCode is also able to show you the methods and properties you are most likely to use and supports completion in multiple programming languages, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C# </li>
				<li>C++ </li>
				<li>XAML </li>
				<li>JavaScript </li>
				<li>TypeScript</li>
				<li>Visual Basic</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's examine how this amazing tool works in the following subsections.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Whole line completions</h2>
			<p>IntelliCode can be extremely useful in <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>helping you complete entire lines of code. Best of all, code predictions are displayed according to different entries in your code, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Variable names</li>
				<li>Function names</li>
				<li>IntelliSense options used</li>
				<li>Libraries used in the project</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are two ways to receive entire line completion hints in Visual Studio 2022:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first one is given automatically while you are writing code. In <em class="italic">Figure 7.18</em>, we can see this in action, as we start writing a new property in the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecast.cs</strong> file of type <strong class="source-inline">string</strong>:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer162" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.18_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.18 – IntelliCode suggesting a full line completion&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.18 – IntelliCode suggesting a full line completion</p>
			<p>According to everything learned by the IntelliCode model, it suggests a new property called <strong class="source-inline">Description</strong>, which we can accept by pressing the <em class="italic">tab</em> key or reject by continuing to write code.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The<a id="_idIndexMarker318"/> second method of line completion through the use of IntelliCode is by selecting an item from the IntelliSense suggestion list. For example, if we create a constructor for the <strong class="source-inline">WeatherForecast</strong> class and type the letter <strong class="source-inline">S</strong>, a list of IntelliSense suggestions will appear. We can scroll through each of them, and in most cases, IntelliCode will show us auto-completion suggestions, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.19</em>: </li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer163" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.19_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.19 – IntelliCode recommending the completion of an IntelliSense element&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.19 – IntelliCode recommending the completion of an IntelliSense element</p>
			<p>We can accept the <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>line by pressing the <em class="italic">tab</em> key twice or continue writing code to ignore the suggestion.</p>
			<p>Now that we have seen the two methods of full line completion, let's see how IntelliCode can help us write code based on its suggestions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>IntelliCode suggestions</h2>
			<p>IntelliCode <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>suggestions are an assisted way to carry out similar code edits in our projects. Basically, IntelliCode keeps track of code we are writing, and if it detects code repetition that could be applied to our code, it will let us know through suggestions.</p>
			<p>A surprising thing about IntelliCode is that it is based on the semantic structure of code, so it can also help us to detect changes that we might have missed, such as changes in formulas.</p>
			<p>For example, suppose we have some methods that allow us to calculate some static values, such as the following example:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">public float Calculate1()</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">{</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">   <strong class="bold">var minValue = 25;</strong></pre>
			<pre class="source-code">   return (float)((minValue + 126) * (Math.PI / minValue));</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">}</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">public float Calculate2()</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">{</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">   <strong class="bold">var minValue = 88;</strong></pre>
			<pre class="source-code">   return (float)((minValue + 126) * (Math.PI / minValue));</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">}      </pre>
			<p>We see that the calculation follows the same structure, and the only thing that changes is the value of the <strong class="source-inline">minValue</strong> variable, so we decide to create a new method called <strong class="source-inline">Calculate</strong>, which will perform the same operation by receiving a parameter:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">public float <strong class="bold">Calculate</strong>(int <strong class="bold">value</strong>)</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">{</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">   return (float)((value + 126) * (Math.PI / value));</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">}</pre>
			<p>Subsequently, we <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>decided to replace code of the <strong class="source-inline">Calculate1</strong> method to invoke the newly created <strong class="source-inline">Calculate</strong> method:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">public float Calculate1()</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">{</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">   var minValue = 25;</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">   return <strong class="bold">Calculate</strong>(minValue);</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">}</pre>
			<p>If we go to the <strong class="source-inline">Calculate2</strong> method and start typing the name of the <strong class="source-inline">Calculate</strong> method, an IntelliCode hint will appear, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.20</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer164" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_7.20_B17873.jpg" alt="Figure 7.20 – IntelliCode suggesting an implementation of the code repetition&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.20 – IntelliCode suggesting an implementation of the code repetition</p>
			<p>The suggestion made by IntelliCode tells us that we can apply the same invocation to the new method, which we can apply by pressing the <em class="italic">tab</em> key, or we can ignore the suggestion and continue writing code.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It is very important to note that IntelliCode suggestions are only available during the development session. This means that if you restart Visual Studio, the previous hints will not appear again.</p>
			<p>As we saw, IntelliCode provides a <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>way to write code much faster through suggestions, which can save you several minutes a day.</p>

			<p>Visual Studio contains a set of tools and windows that can help us a lot while we are developing our projects.</p>
			<p>We have seen how CodeLens can help us find references and relationships, both through code and visually. Likewise, we have studied the different code windows that help to examine class members in projects. Finally, we have seen how IntelliCode is a new addition to the IDE, which through artificial intelligence helps us to write code quickly through various suggestions.</p>
