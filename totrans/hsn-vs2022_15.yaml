- en: Collaboration tools are a new way to work remotely and make it easier for a
    group to achieve one common goal. It's amazing to see how we can edit the same
    document, record, or share resources in real time with other users. If we want
    to collaborate on coding or perform **pair programming**, which is a technique
    where two programmers work together on the same code, we need to be working in
    the same place, on the same machine, or use a tool to use a video call to perform
    these activities.
