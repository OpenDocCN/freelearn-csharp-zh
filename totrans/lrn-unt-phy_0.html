I wrote this book to provide a detailed description with examples for learning a Physics component of Unity3D in a way that emphasizes the uniqueness of each component and their implementation.</p><p class="calibre8">The successful implementation of Physics in game or application development starts with a strong understanding of each component. When we look at game and application development in Unity3D, it is easy to see that Physics is the most important component. I have provided the conceptual foundation of a Physics component and introduced these using examples for a better understanding.</p><p class="calibre8">I had three main goals while writing this book:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre9">Accuracy</strong></span>: This book is the result of years of experience and research. This book focuses on the Physics components of Unity3D and their implementations.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre9">Implementation</strong></span>: My experience as a developer has taught me two things about examples: they need to be detailed, and they must help developers do their work. As a result, users of my book will always find abundant examples with every step carefully laid out and explained wherever necessary so that the reader can follow. To describe and explain the Physics of Unity3D, this book uses realistic examples to help developers get inside of what Physics is really like. In addition to the examples, I have provided detailed screenshots and figures for a better understanding. These examples will help developers in the successful implementation of Physics components in their game or application as well as help them identify the best practices they need to adopt to improve their game or application performance.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre9">A structured approach</strong></span>: I have tried to explain Physics and Unity3D in a reader-friendly way. Most books claim to do this, but my experience with a variety of books has proven otherwise. What students and developers will find in my book are short, precise explanations of terms and concepts that are written in an understandable language. For example, I have used more images rather than text to explain steps of implementations, which gives a better understanding for readers.</li></ul></div><div class="book" title="What this book covers"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre13" id="calibre_pb_1"/>
