                    <h1 class="header-title">Designing the Game</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In <a href="bab37b44-932a-4277-884d-69b6bac37516.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>The Unity Interface</em>, we examined Unity's user interface and paid specific attention to the most commonly used components that include: menus, Scene view, Game view, Project window, Hierarchy window, Inspector window, Toolbar, and Layouts. Becoming familiar with Unity's interface gives us the confidence to move forward with the game engine and to explore additional interface components as we introduce new functionality necessary to create our game.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter we will design our game, <em>Cucumber Beetle</em>, so that we can create a development plan. Our game design will include all the functionality we want in our game, the player character, the non-player characters, game assets, animations, and more. We will use screen mock-ups, as well as narrative, to document our game's design. We will look at related concepts regarding using Unity for our game along the way.</p>
<p>Specifically, we will examine the following concepts in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game concept</li>
<li>Game characters</li>
<li>Gameplay</li>
<li>The difficulty balance</li>
<li>Project organization</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Game concept</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Why design our game, why not just start developing it? This question spawns from the excitement of developing games, especially with the Unity game engine. All games start with an idea. That idea is translated into a design, and that design is the basis for development and, eventually, the final game.</p>
<p>A game's design is like a blueprint for a house. You would not consider building a house without a blueprint, and it is an equally bad idea to develop a game without designing it first. The reason for this is to save time and frustration. For larger projects, time wasted also means unnecessary funds were expended. Imagine that you employed a project team of twelve developers, animators, and artists. If you shared your game idea, would they have enough to go on? Would they do great things, but not have a cohesive set of components for your game? All we are doing with our game design is documenting as much as we can in the beginning so that the development process is purposeful. Without question, you will continually modify your game's design during development, so having a strong base to start from is critical to your success.</p>
<p>Our game design will serve as the foundation for the look of our game, what the player's objectives are, what the gameplay will be, supporting user actions, animations, audio, artificial intelligence, and victory conditions. That is a lot to think about, and underscores the importance of translating the game idea into a game design.</p>
<p>Throughout the book we will be covering a range of components, however, in this section, we will cover those which are listed beneath:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game idea </li>
<li>Input controls </li>
<li>Winning and losing </li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Game idea</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The basic concept of our <em>Cucumber Beetle</em> game is that it will be a 3D game featuring a Cucumber Man as the player character. The character must protect the cucumber patches, fighting off Cucumber Beetles. These beetles are intent on destroying the cucumber patches and anyone that gets in their way, including our Cucumber Man. </p>
<p>The Cucumber Man will harvest cherries from cherry trees and throw them at the Cucumber Beetles. This will be the only form of defense our Cucumber Man has against the Cucumber Beetles, except for running away.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Input controls</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>It is important to consider how players will interact with our game. The player will control the Cucumber Man using the standard set of controls. Players have an expectation that the industry norms for user controls will be implemented in games. So our default set of user input control, as shown here, will consist of the keyboard and mouse:</p>
<div><img height="305" width="558" src="img/cbfa79de-693a-44fd-ac9e-61b43bf53398.png"/></div>
<p>We will configure and program our game so that user input from the keyboard matches the key and action pairings in the following table:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Keyboard input</strong></td>
<td><strong>Action</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Up arrow</td>
<td>Move forward/up</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Down arrow</td>
<td>Move back/down</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Left arrow</td>
<td>Move left</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Right arrow</td>
<td>Move right</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>W</em></td>
<td>Move forward/up</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>S</em></td>
<td>Move back/down</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>A</em></td>
<td>Move left </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>D</em></td>
<td>Move right</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Space bar</td>
<td>Jump</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>The mouse will also be a significant source of user input. We will implement two components using the mouse as indicated in the following table:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Mouse input</strong></td>
<td><strong>Action</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mouse movement</td>
<td>Rotate character</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Left button</td>
<td>Throw cherry</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>The left mouse button will be our action button. We will need to ensure cherries are thrown only when the player has one or more cherries remaining.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Winning and losing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Our winning condition will be when all the Cucumber Beetles have been eliminated. There will be two different ways the player can lose the game. The first losing condition is when all the cucumbers have been eaten by the Cucumber Beetles.  The second losing condition is if the player runs out of lives. </p>
<p>By this short description, you can tell there will be several things to keep track of, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Cucumber Beetles</li>
<li>Number of cucumbers</li>
<li>Number of Cucumber Man lives</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Game characters</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Our game will use several game objects, but only two game characters. The first game character is the Cucumber Man, and will be controlled by the player. The second game character is the Cucumber Beetle. This is a non-player character that is controlled by artificial intelligence. Let's look more closely at both of these characters.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Cucumber Man</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The player will play our game as the Cucumber Man, our game's protagonist. This is a character that we will import for use in our game. It was created using Maya, a professional 3D modeling and animation software suite, and Photoshop. Here is a look at our Cucumber Man:</p>
<div><img height="313" width="352" src="img/d26cced7-9dcb-42f0-aa9e-e1962d5fe27a.png"/></div>
<p>So, what can the Cucumber Man player character do? We already know we will be able to move him throughout our game environment using a combination of keyboard and mouse inputs. We also know that the space bar will cause him to jump and that the left mouse button, our action button, will cause him to shoot cherries.</p>
<p>Because the Cucumber Man is controlled by the human player, it is referred to as the <strong>Player</strong> <strong>Character</strong>.</p>
<p>We will implement the following animations for the Cucumber Man:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idle</strong>: This will play when the character is not being moved by the player.</li>
<li><strong>Walk</strong>: This is the animation that will play when the player causes the Cucumber Man to walk, regardless of direction.</li>
<li><strong>Run</strong>: This animation is similar to the walk animation. It is faster and covers distances quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Jump</strong>: We will implement a jump whenever the space bar is pressed.</li>
<li><strong>Die</strong>: Should our character be overcome by the Cucumber Beetles, we will play this animation.</li>
<li><strong>Throw</strong>: This is the animation that will cause the Cucumber Man to throw a cherry.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other action our Cucumber Man can make is to collect cherries. We will implement this with an auto-collection system. Whenever the Cucumber Man is touching a cherry tree, we will increment the number of cherries he has by one. </p>
<p>We will implement the Cucumber Man in <a href="6a3fb463-b0c2-4145-9096-bc52d55cf905.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Implementing Our Player Character</em>. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Cucumber Beetle</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Our game's antagonist will be the Cucumber Beetle. We will control how many of them we want in our game and where they are placed. We will also control their behaviors through artificial intelligence. The Cucumber Beetle character was created using Maya and Photoshop, the same software pair used to create the Cucumber Man. Here is a look at our Cucumber Beetle:</p>
<div><img height="248" width="248" src="img/3cab4dc5-3d0e-4c2f-834a-ea84a9b38f3c.png"/></div>
<p>The Cucumber Beetles will search for and consume cucumbers. We will determine how long it takes a cucumber to be consumed. As you can see in the preceding illustration, there are images for the cucumber beetle in its normal state, with all six legs on the ground, and standing up. The stand-up position will be used when it is attacking the Cucumber Man.</p>
<p>Because the Cucumber Beetle is controlled by artificial intelligence and not a human player, it is referred to as the <strong>Non-Player</strong> <strong>Character</strong>.</p>
<p>We will implement the following animations for the Cucumber Beetles:</p>
<ul>
<li>While on the ground:
<ul>
<li><strong>Idle</strong>: This will play when the cucumber beetle is not searching, eating, or attacking. </li>
<li><strong>Ground Walk</strong>: This is the animation that will play when the cucumber beetle is walking.</li>
<li><strong>Eating</strong>: This animation will play when the cucumber beetle has located a cucumber and is eating it. Beetles are smaller than cucumbers, so it takes more than one bite.</li>
<li><strong>Ground Attack</strong>: The cucumber beetle will attack the Cucumber Man with its feelers.</li>
<li><strong>Stand then Idle</strong>: This animation takes the cucumber beetle from being on the ground to standing up and remaining idle.</li>
<li><strong>Ground Death</strong>: This animation will play when the Cucumber Man defeats a cucumber beetle in its on-ground position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While standing:
<ul>
<li><strong>Walk</strong>: We will give our Cucumber Beetles the ability to walk on their back two legs</li>
<li><strong>Run</strong>: The Cucumber Beetles will be able to run towards the Cucumber Man on its back two legs</li>
<li><strong>Standing Attack</strong>: When standing, the Cucumber Beetles will be able to attack the Cucumber Man with its top four legs</li>
<li><strong>Standing Death</strong>: This animation will play when the Cucumber Man defeats a Cucumber Beetle in its standing position</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will require careful planning and scripting to create the desired Cucumber Beetle behaviors. The number and placement of the Cucumber Beetles are decisions we will need to make. </p>
<p>We will implement the Cucumber Beetles in <a href="28e6a940-f5d3-49ba-8778-a0b533b4a83e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Implementing Our Non-Player Characters</em>. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Gameplay</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The game will start with the player in the center of the game world. The Cucumber Man, controlled by the player, will need to defend the cucumber patches from the Cucumber Beetles. To fend off the Cucumber Beetles, the Cucumber Man will need to collect cherries from nearby cherry trees. The goal is to defeat all the Cucumber Beetles before the cucumbers in the cucumber patches are all gone. </p>
<p>Let's look at how we will make all this happen. The following game play components are covered in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game world layout</li>
<li>Starting condition</li>
<li>Point system</li>
<li>Heads-Up Display</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Game world layout</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Will will create our game world in <a href="f9370800-eaf9-4593-8a9c-8252c85e22ac.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Creating Our Terrain</em>, and then add cameras and lighting effects in <a href="101c3b96-a362-4913-925c-f22503f0f8a1.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Lights, Cameras, and Shadows</em>. We will create a basic outdoor environment that consists of a large island surrounded by water. The water will be for aesthetics and boundary purposes. We will not make use of the water; after all, cucumbers cannot swim.</p>
<p>Here is a mock-up of the shape our game world will take:</p>
<div><img height="440" width="553" src="img/5afb8154-bd93-48a4-8f70-7c3812d4afce.png"/></div>
<p>There are four basic things illustrated in the preceding mock-up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water</strong>: This will just be used for our game world border.</li>
<li><strong>Spawn Points</strong>: There are five spawn points, and we can randomly spawn our player character to one after losing a life.</li>
<li><strong>Cherry Trees</strong>: We will place four sizeable clumps of cherry trees in the game world.</li>
<li><strong>Cucumber Patches</strong>: These are not labeled in the mock-up, but are represented by the green scribbled areas. This represents the rough approximation of where the vast cucumber patches will be planted or, in our Unity terminology, placed. </li>
</ul>
<p>The only item not represented in our mock-up is the placement of the Cucumber Beetles. We will place the beetles somewhat randomly through scripting. We will do that in <a href="28e6a940-f5d3-49ba-8778-a0b533b4a83e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Implementing Our Non-Player Characters</em>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Starting condition</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When our game is first launched, we will have several starting conditions set. Here is a list of those conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cucumber Man spawn point</li>
<li>Number and placement of Cucumber Beetles</li>
<li>Number of cherries held by Cucumber Man</li>
<li>Number and placement of cucumbers</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at each of these starting conditions.</p>
<p>The first starting condition is where to spawn the Cucumber Man. As you saw in our earlier mock-up, there will be five possible spawn points in the game. We will write a script to spawn the player in a random spot each time. While there are only five spots, it does add enough randomness into the game to make this a fun and challenging component.</p>
<p>The number and placement of Cucumber Beetles is the second starting condition. This is an important pair of decisions to make. If we decide poorly, the game is likely to be too easy or too hard and, in both of these situations, the game would not be challenging enough to make it fun to play. We will look at this issue in greater detail in the section titled <em>The difficulty balance</em> later in this chapter. </p>
<p>The number of cherries held by the Cucumber Man is our third starting condition. The Cucumber Man will start with zero cherries and, each time he is respawned, he will also have zero cherries. So, if the Cucumber Man has 319 cherries and is defeated by one or more Cucumber Beetles, the Cucumber Man will respawn with zero cherries, losing the 319 cherries he had.</p>
<p>Our fourth and final starting condition is the number and placement of cucumbers. This is an important set of considerations, and is tied to the placement and number of Cucumber Beetles. We will examine the possibilities and the likely outcomes of our decisions regarding this issue in the section titled <em>The difficulty balance</em> later in this chapter. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Point system</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>So far, we have established that we would track several components in the game. These are listed here along with the variable name that we will use in our scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Cucumber Beetles:
<ul>
<li><kbd>numberOfCucumberBeetles</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Number of cucumbers:
<ul>
<li><kbd>numberOfCucumbers</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Number of Cucumber Man lives:
<ul>
<li><kbd>livesLeft</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on what we decided earlier regarding the end-of-game condition, we can apply the following mathematical checks to determine if the game has ended and what the outcome is. Each end-of-game condition is listed in the following table along with the outcome:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Condition number</strong></td>
<td><strong>End-of-game condition</strong></td>
<td><strong>Outcome</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><kbd>numberOfCucumbers == 0</kbd></td>
<td>Cucumber Beetles Win</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>
<p><kbd>numberOfCucumberBeetles == 0</kbd></p>
</td>
<td>Cucumber Man Wins</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><kbd>livesLeft == 0</kbd></td>
<td>Cucumber Beetles Win</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to implement the three end-of-game conditions, we know we have to track the number of beetles, cucumbers, and lives. This is not optional. Where we do have flexibility is with what we display to the user. We will make that decision in the next section, <em>Heads-Up Display</em>.</p>
<p>Since we are tracking key information that involves numbers, it makes it easy for us to implement a point system. We could, for example, give the player 50 points each time a Cucumber Beetle is exterminated. We could also take away points each time a Cucumber Beetle takes a bite out of the Cucumber Man.</p>
<p>The point system that we will implement in our <em>Cucumber Beetle</em> game will consist of two types of events, those that result in points being added and those resulting in points being subtracted. Here is a table with the details of our point system:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>In-game event</strong></td>
<td><strong>Points</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Start of Game</td>
<td>+ 1,500 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cucumber Man Picks Cherry</td>
<td>+ 5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cucumber Man Hits Cucumber Beetle with Cherry on the Ground</td>
<td>+ 10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cucumber Man Exterminates Cucumber Beetle on the Ground</td>
<td>+ 25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cucumber Man Hits Standing Cucumber Beetle with Cherry</td>
<td>+ 50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cucumber Man Exterminates Standing Cucumber Beetle </td>
<td>+100</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cucumber Man Loses Life</td>
<td>- 500</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see from the preceding table, we will start our player with 1,500 points and subtract 500 each time a life is lost. This will ensure we do not have a negative point total, and is one less thing for us to check in our scripts. This also gives players a bonus for each life they save.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Heads-Up Display</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We have decided to keep track of information during gameplay that has value beyond calculating points and the end of game. The player will want to see this information as it tends to provide motivation and adds to the fun of the game. So, we will create a Heads-Up Display for the player, and dynamically update the data in the game.</p>
<p>A <strong>Heads-Up Display</strong> (<strong>HUD</strong>) is a visual layer of information that is always present on the screen.</p>
<p>Here is a mock-up of what our <strong>Heads-Up Display</strong> will look like in our <em>Cucumber Beetle</em> game:</p>
<div><img height="313" width="408" src="img/ce94e2d8-a01c-4956-ac23-7d1d9b2a285e.png"/></div>
<p>As you can see, there are six components to our HUD. Each of these are explained in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: This will consist of a text label and a health meter.</li>
<li><strong>Lives</strong>: The icons underneath the Health text label signify how many lives remain. We will not add a label to this as its function will be clear to the player. We will use an image of the Cucumber Man as the icon.</li>
<li><strong>Score</strong>: The score will be presented in the top-right-hand corner of the screen.</li>
<li><strong>Cherries</strong>: We will show the number of cherries directly beneath the score.</li>
<li><strong>Cucumbers</strong>: The bottom left-hand-corner of the HUD contains two components. The first component is the number of cucumbers left in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Cucumber Beetles</strong>: The number of Cucumber Beetles currently left in the game will be displayed in the bottom-left-hand corner of the HUD, below the number of cucumbers.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The difficulty balance</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are a lot of considerations to make when determining how difficult your game should be. If it is too difficult, players will lose interest, and if the game is too easy, it might not appeal to your intended audience. Some games include difficulty levels for users to select from. Other games have multiple levels, each with an increasing level of difficulty. There are several questions that we must contend with in order to achieve our desired difficulty balance.</p>
<p>In this section, we will first look at the difficulty balance questions, followed by our implementation plan.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Difficulty balance questions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are a lot of questions about our game that we need to consider in our game design. A review of the questions in this section will help us gain an appreciation for the issues that even a simple game such as ours must contend with to achieve the desired difficulty balance.</p>
<p>This first set of questions are related to the overall implementation of difficulty in our game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we have different levels of difficulty, selectable by the player?
<ul>
<li>How many different difficulty levels should there be?</li>
<li>What will the difficulty levels be called?</li>
<li>What specifically will be different with each difficulty level?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should we have multiple game levels, each with an increased amount of difficulty?
<ul>
<li>How many different game levels should there be?</li>
<li>What will the game levels be called?</li>
<li>What specifically will be different with each game level?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the following questions regarding the Cucumber Beetles in our game:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many Cucumber Beetles should there be?</li>
<li>How passive or aggressive should the Cucumber Beetles be?</li>
<li>At what distance should a cucumber beetle become aware of the Cucumber Man?</li>
<li>How effective should the Cucumber Beetles be in finding cucumbers?</li>
<li>How much damage should a Cucumber Beetle inflict on the Cucumber Man with each attack?</li>
<li>How much damage can a Cucumber Beetle endure before it dies?</li>
<li>Should Cucumber Beetles communicate and help each other in coordinated attacks?</li>
</ul>
<p>This next set of questions refers to our playable character, the Cucumber Man:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many lives should the character have?</li>
<li>How much damage will the character take from a single cucumber beetle attack?</li>
<li>How much damage can the character endure before they die?</li>
<li>Should the character be able to outrun Cucumber Beetles?</li>
<li>Should there be a maximum number of cherries held by the character? If so, how many?</li>
<li>Where should the player spawn? In a safe area?</li>
<li>When the character loses a life, should they respawn without their cherries?</li>
<li>When the character respawns, should full health be restored?</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have cucumbers and cherries to account for in our game. Here are a couple of questions for each of those game assets that we will implement in our game.</p>
<p>Cucumbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many bites should it take for a cucumber beetle to consume a cucumber?</li>
<li>How many cucumbers should there be in the game?</li>
<li>Where should the cucumbers be located in the game environment?</li>
</ul>
<p>Cherries:</p>
<ul>
<li>At what pace should the player be able to gather cherries?</li>
<li>What will be the maximum number of cherries the Cucumber Man can have?</li>
<li>How much damage will the cherries inflict on the Cucumber Beetles?</li>
<li>How many cherries will be available in the game?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are several questions that we need to answer as part of our design. Some of the questions may seem redundant as they relate to more than one component in the game. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Implementation plan</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Based on the questions posed in the last section, we must come up with some answers. So, let's do that here. This set of answers will serve as the implementation plan for our difficulty balance. </p>
<p>Our first set of decisions focuses on the overall game concept. Here are those decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement one game level.</li>
<li>Provide the user with three game difficulty settings. Setting names are provided here:
<ul>
<li>I'm a Baby Cucumber (Easiest)</li>
<li>I Can Handle This (Moderate)</li>
<li>Bring It! (Most difficult)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we've decided to create three game levels, we must determine how they will be different. This is easily managed by using a matrix. As we fill in the matrix, we will be able to document answers to most of the previously listed questions. Here is what we will refer to as the <em>Difficulty Implementation Matrix</em>:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Component</strong></td>
<td><strong>I'm a Baby Cucumber</strong></td>
<td><strong>I Can Handle This</strong></td>
<td><strong>Bring It!</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Number of Cucumber Beetles</td>
<td>X</td>
<td>X * 2</td>
<td>X * 5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Damage from Cucumber Beetles (to Cucumber Man)</td>
<td>-5 health points per second</td>
<td>-10 health points per second</td>
<td>-20 health points per second</td>

<tr>

<td>X *.50</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>There will also be a set of decisions that will not change based on the user-selected difficulty level. Here is a list of those decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aggressiveness of the Cucumber Beetles will not change. We will script them so that if they are aware of the Cucumber Man, they will attack him. </li>
<li>We will establish a pretty small vision area for the Cucumber Beetles making it easy for the Cucumber Man to sneak past them and perhaps, more importantly, outrun them.</li>
<li>Cucumber Beetles will be able to easily find cucumbers.</li>
<li>Cucumber Beetles will not communicate with one another. So, there will be no coordinated attacks. This does not mean that more than one Cucumber Beetle can't attack the Cucumber Man at the same time. All Cucumber Beetles' within range of the Cucumber Man will attack.</li>
<li>The Cucumber Man will start with three lives.</li>
<li>We will not limit the number of cherries a player can collect, but they will all be lost as part of the respawn process.</li>
<li>Respawning will be randomized between the five respawn points previously identified in the game's mock-up.</li>
<li>The Cucumber Man will start with full health after a respawn.</li>
<li>The cucumbers will be placed randomly in the game within the cucumber patches.</li>
<li>The number of cherry trees and cherries will not vary with different difficulty levels.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Project organization </h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Our project will consist of a lot of assets. So far we have identified and detailed our planned use of the Cucumber Man, our player characters, and the Cucumber Beetles, our non-player character. We will also use cherry trees, cherries, and cucumber patches. Let's briefly look at those in the next section, <em>Custom assets</em>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Custom assets</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Several custom assets have been created using Maya and Photoshop for use in our game. The first set of assets are two forms of cucumber patches, both shown in the following image:</p>
<div><img height="265" width="455" src="img/415cb1cc-0c91-48ad-9dfd-6ecce439fed9.png"/></div>
<p>We will use these cucumber patches to cover large sections of our game environment, as identified earlier in this chapter. We have two different patch formations to help create an authentic and non-repetitive look to the game environment. We will also rotate the patches to add variability to the overall visual appearance of the ground covering.</p>
<p>A custom cucumber will also be provided in our game. While there might be hundreds of them in the game, we will use one base cucumber, pictured here, and replicate it throughout the game environment. We can modify the size and rotation to ensure we have what will appear to be a lot of unique cucumbers:</p>
<div><img height="233" width="126" src="img/5b81e509-42da-43c8-8568-a8bcd77f5e35.png"/></div>
<p>Our next custom asset is a cherry tree. Our base tree is shown here and has a unique form. We can alter the size and rotation of this tree to create the visual of a bunch of unique trees. Certainly this is not an authentic cherry tree, but it will be suitable for our purposes:</p>
<div><img height="267" width="328" src="img/a8e50bd3-6060-4a77-9ea4-0fdcc3fe1353.png"/></div>
<p>Although our cherry trees have cherries on them, they are all part of the tree and not separate objects. So, our player character can collect cherries from the cherry trees, but there will be no visual indication that the cherries have been picked. We will update our HUD to provide that indication. For throwing cherries at Cucumber Beetles, we will use the cherry shown in the following image:</p>
<div><img height="167" width="138" src="img/02cc3787-9dc3-409f-a385-14eb891fadb7.png"/> </div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Standard assets</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In addition to the custom assets created for this game, we will use many of Unity's standard assets including textures, materials, and 3D objects. We will start using textures and materials in <a href="f9370800-eaf9-4593-8a9c-8252c85e22ac.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Creating Our Terrain</em>. We will create our own 3D assets using Unity's native tools, as well as importing additional ones in <a href="04be4d7b-8c85-4d9e-baf2-43965183f99f.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Creating and Importing 3D Object for Our Game</em>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Organization</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If we do not have a plan to be organized, our project can quickly get out of hand. Unity has great search support for project components, but we would rather be able to quickly navigate to our assets. Here is the basic structure that we will make as we start creating our game:</p>
<div><img height="90" width="156" src="img/5128e255-4c28-46f3-8779-c2a55ad20bd2.png"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we fully designed our game, <em>Cucumber Beetle</em>, and we plan to use our design to drive our development efforts. Our game design includes functionality, the player character, the non-player characters, game assets, animations, and more. We used screen mock-ups to help document our game's design. In addition, we planned our game's difficulty balance to help ensure the game is appropriately difficult based on user selection.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In the next chapter, you will learn how to create the game's terrain. You will gain exposure to shaping tools and terrain painting. You will also learn how to add vegetation and water to our terrain. By the end of the next chapter, you will have created the game world for the <em>Cucumber Beetle</em> game.</p>
