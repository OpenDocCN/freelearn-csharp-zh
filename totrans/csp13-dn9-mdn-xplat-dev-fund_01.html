    <h1 id="_idParaDest-12" class="chapterTitle">Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET!</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this first chapter, the first goal is setting up your development environment to use Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">Throughout this book, I will use the names <strong class="keyWord">Visual Studio</strong>, <strong class="keyWord">VS Code</strong>, and <strong class="keyWord">Rider</strong> to refer to these three code editors, respectively.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">The other goals are understanding the similarities and differences between modern .NET, .NET Core, .NET Framework, Mono, Xamarin, and .NET Standard; creating the simplest application possible with C# 13 and .NET 9, using various code editors; and then discovering good places to look for help.</p>
    <p class="normal">My style of writing ensures that you can get started from my book and then switch to online documentation and other online resources, like videos, blogs, and forums, which are the main ways that developers like to learn, as shown at the following link: <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/developer-profile#learning-to-code">https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/developer-profile#learning-to-code</a>.</p>

    </ul>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-13" class="heading-1">Introducing this book and its contents</h1>
    <p class="normal">Let’s get started by introducing you to the code solutions, structure, and content of this book.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-14" class="heading-2">Getting code solutions for this book</h2>
    <p class="normal">The GitHub repository for this book has solutions that use full application projects for all code tasks and exercises, found at the following link:</p>
    <p class="normal"><a href="https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9">https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9</a></p>
    <p class="normal">After navigating to the GitHub repository in your web browser, press the <code class="inlineCode">.</code> (dot) key on your keyboard, or manually change <code class="inlineCode">.com</code> to <code class="inlineCode">.dev</code> in the link to convert the repository into a live code editor based on <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>VS Code, called GitHub Codespaces, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.1</em>:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.1: GitHub Codespaces live-editing the book’s GitHub repository</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Warning!</strong> When you access a repository using GitHub Codespaces, its GitHub Repositories extension will attempt to download the repository’s index. By default, the maximum size can be up to 50MB but the repository exceeds this limit, so you will see the following warning message: <code class="inlineCode">Repository exceeds download size limit! Continuing with partial text services.</code> You can ignore this message because you are not using the full features.</p>
    </div>
    <div><p class="normal">We provide you with a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots and diagrams used in this book. You can download this file from <a href="https://packt.link/gbp/9781837635870">https://packt.link/gbp/9781837635870</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">VS Code in a web browser is great to run alongside your chosen local code editor as you work through the book’s coding tasks. You can compare your code to the solution code and easily copy and paste parts if needed.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">You do not need to use or know anything about Git to get the solution code of this book. You can download a ZIP file containing all the code solutions by using the following direct link and then extract the ZIP file into your local filesystem: <a href="https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/archive/refs/heads/main.zip</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-15" class="heading-2">.NET terms used in this book</h2>
    <p class="normal">Throughout this book, I use the<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> term <strong class="keyWord">modern .NET</strong> to refer to .NET 9 and its predecessors, like .NET 6, that derive from .NET Core. I use the term <strong class="keyWord">legacy .NET</strong> to refer to .NET <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>Framework, Mono, Xamarin, and .NET Standard.</p>
    <p class="normal">Modern .NET is a unification of those legacy platforms and standards.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-16" class="heading-2">The structure and style of this book</h2>
    <p class="normal">After this first chapter, the book will be divided into three parts: language, libraries, and web development.</p>
    <p class="normal">First, we will cover the grammar and vocabulary of the C# language; second, we will cover the types available in the .NET libraries for building app features; and third, we will cover the fundamentals of cross-platform websites, services, and browser apps that you can build using C# and .NET.</p>
    <p class="normal">Most people learn complex topics best by imitation and repetition, rather than reading a detailed explanation of the theory; therefore, I will not overload you with detailed explanations of every step throughout this book. The idea is to get you to write some code and see it run.</p>
    <p class="normal">You don’t need to know all the nitty-gritty details immediately. That will be something that comes with time as you build your own apps and go beyond what any book can teach you.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the words of Samuel Johnson, author of the English dictionary in 1755, I have committed <em class="italic">“a few wild blunders, and risible absurdities, from which no work of such multiplicity is free.”</em> I take sole responsibility for these and hope you appreciate the challenge of my attempt to lash the wind by writing this book about rapidly evolving technologies, like C# and .NET, and the apps that you can build with them.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">If you have a complaint about this book, then please contact me before writing a negative review on Amazon. Authors cannot respond to Amazon reviews, so I cannot contact you to resolve the problem and help you or listen to your feedback and try to do better in the next edition. Please ask a question on the Discord channel for this book at <a href="https://packt.link/csharp13dotnet9">https://packt.link/csharp13dotnet9</a>, email me at <code class="inlineCode">markjprice@gmail.com</code>, or raise an issue in the GitHub repository for the book at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/issues">https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/issues</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-17" class="heading-2">Topics covered by this book</h2>
    <p class="normal">The following topics are covered in this book:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Language fundamentals</strong>: Fundamental features of the C# language, from declaring variables to writing functions and object-oriented programming.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Library fundamentals</strong>: Fundamental features of the .NET base class library, as well as some important optional packages for common tasks like database access.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Modern web development fundamentals</strong>: Modern features of the ASP.NET Core framework for server-side and client-side website and web service development. This includes Blazor and Minimal APIs and excludes controller-based features like MVC and Web API, or legacy features like Razor Pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">This book, <em class="italic">C# 13 and .NET 9 – Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals</em>, is best read linearly, chapter by chapter, because it builds up fundamental skills and knowledge.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-18" class="heading-2">Topics covered by Apps and Services with .NET 8</h2>
    <p class="normal">The following topics are available in a companion book, <em class="italic">Apps and Services with .NET 8</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Data</strong>: SQL Server and Azure Cosmos DB.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Specialized libraries</strong>: Dates, times, time zones, and internationalization; common third-party libraries for image handling, logging, mapping, and generating PDFs; multitasking and concurrency; and many more.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Services</strong>: Caching, queuing, background services, gRPC, GraphQL, Azure Functions, SignalR, and Minimal APIs.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">User interfaces</strong>: ASP.NET Core, Blazor, and .NET MAUI.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">This book can be read more like a cookbook, so if you are especially interested in building gRPC services, then you can read that chapter without the preceding chapters about minimal API services.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-19" class="heading-2">Topics covered by Tools and Skills for .NET 8</h2>
    <p class="normal">The following topics are available in a companion book, <em class="italic">Tools and Skills for .NET 8</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Debugging and memory analysis.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">All the important types of testing, from unit and integration to performance and web UI testing.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Docker and .NET Aspire for local distributed development and testing.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Design patterns and solution architecture.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Preparing for an interview to get the .NET developer career that you want.</li>
    </ul>
    <div><p class="normal">My books for .NET 8 are equally applicable to .NET 9. You can make your projects target .NET 9 and all the code examples will work. You should not need to wait for packages to upgrade to also target .NET 9, due to backward compatibility.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-20" class="heading-2">Finding all my books</h2>
    <p class="normal">To see a list of all the books I have published with Packt, you can use the following link:</p>

    <p class="normal">You can search other book-selling sites for my books too.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-21" class="heading-1">Setting up your development environment</h1>
    <p class="normal">Before you start <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>programming, you’ll need a code editor for C#, either from Microsoft or a third party.</p>
    <p class="normal">Microsoft has a family of code <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>editors and <strong class="keyWord">Integrated Development Environments</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IDEs</strong>), which include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Visual Studio for Windows</li>
      <li class="bulletList">VS Code for Windows, Mac, or Linux</li>
      <li class="bulletList">VS Code for the Web or GitHub Codespaces</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Third parties have created their own C# code editors; for example, JetBrains has the cross-platform Rider, which is available for Windows, Mac, or Linux and since October 2024 is free for non-commercial use. Rider is popular with more experienced .NET developers.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Warning!</strong> Although JetBrains is a fantastic company with great products, both Rider and the ReSharper extension for Visual Studio are software, and all software has bugs and quirky behavior. For example, they might show errors like <em class="italic">Cannot resolve symbol</em> in your Razor Pages, Razor views, and Blazor components. Yet you can build and run those files because there is no actual problem. If you have installed the Unity Support plugin, then it will complain about boxing operations (which are a genuine problem for Unity game developers) but in projects that are not Unity; hence, the warning is not applicable.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Most readers use Visual Studio, which is a large and complex tool that can do many things. But Visual Studio likes to provide its own mechanism to do as much as possible, and a .NET <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>developer who uses it could easily think that Visual Studio is the only way to complete a .NET-related task, like modifying project configuration or editing a code file.</p>
    <p class="normal">Always try to remember that Visual Studio and all the other code editors are just tools that do work for you that you could do manually. They just show you a view above what is really happening in the files you’re working on, like the project file and all the C# code files.</p>
    <p class="normal">You could just use a plain text editor to manually edit the project and code files. Ultimately, you use the <code class="inlineCode">dotnet</code> command-line interface to compile– aka build– the project files into a runnable assembly packaged as either a <code class="inlineCode">.dll</code> or <code class="inlineCode">.exe</code> file, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.2</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B22322_01_02.png" alt="" width="824" height="174"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.2: All code editors ultimately just change underlying files</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-22" class="heading-2">Choosing the appropriate tool and application type for learning</h2>
    <p class="normal">What is the best tool and application type for learning C# and .NET?</p>
    <p class="normal">When learning, the best tool is one that helps you write code and configuration but does not hide what is <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>really happening. IDEs provide graphical user interfaces that are friendly to use, but what are they doing for you underneath? A more basic code editor that is closer to the action while providing help to write your code can be better while you are learning.</p>
    <p class="normal">Having said that, you could make the argument that the best tool is the one you are already familiar with or that you or your team will use as your daily development tool. For that reason, I want you to be free to choose any C# code editor or IDE to complete the coding tasks in this book, including VS Code, Visual Studio, and even Rider.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this book, I give detailed step-by-step instructions in <em class="chapterRef">this chapter</em> on how to create multiple projects in both Visual Studio and VS Code. There are also links to online instructions for other code editors, as shown at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/code-editors/README.md">https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/code-editors/README.md</a>.</p>
    <p class="normal">In subsequent chapters, I will only give the names of projects along with general instructions, so you can use whichever tool you prefer.</p>
    <p class="normal">The best application type for learning the C# language constructs and many of the .NET libraries is one that does not distract with unnecessary application code. For example, there is no need to create an entire Windows desktop application or a website just to learn how to write a <code class="inlineCode">switch</code> statement.</p>
    <p class="normal">For that reason, I believe the best method for learning the C# and .NET topics in <em class="chapterRef">Chapters 1</em> to <em class="chapterRef">11</em> is to build <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>console apps. Then, in <em class="chapterRef">Chapters 12</em><em class="italic"> </em>to<em class="italic"> </em><em class="chapterRef">15</em>, which are about web development, you will build websites and services using the modern parts of ASP.NET Core, including Blazor and Minimal APIs.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-23" class="heading-3">VS Code for cross-platform development</h3>
    <p class="normal">The most modern and lightweight code editor to choose from, and the only one from Microsoft that is cross-platform, is VS Code. It can run on all common operating systems, including<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> Windows, macOS, and many varieties of Linux, including <strong class="keyWord">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">RHEL</strong>) and Ubuntu.</p>
    <p class="normal">VS Code is a good choice for<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> modern cross-platform development because it has an extensive and growing set of extensions to support many languages beyond C#. The most important extension for C# and .NET <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>developers is the <strong class="keyWord">C# Dev Kit</strong> that was released in preview in June 2023, as it turns VS Code from a general-purpose code editor into a tool optimized for C# and .NET developers.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">More Information</strong>: You can read about the <strong class="screenText">C# Dev Kit</strong> extension in the official announcement at the following link: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/announcing-csharp-dev-kit-for-visual-studio-code/">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/announcing-csharp-dev-kit-for-visual-studio-code/</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Being cross-platform and lightweight, VS Code and its extensions can be installed on all platforms that your apps will be deployed to for quick bug fixes and so on. Choosing VS Code means a developer can use a cross-platform code editor to develop cross-platform apps. VS Code is supported on ARM processors so that you can develop on Apple Silicon computers and Raspberry Pi computers.</p>
    <p class="normal">VS Code has strong support for web development, although it currently has weak support for mobile and desktop development.</p>
    <p class="normal">VS Code is by far the most popular code editor or IDE, with over 73% of professional developers<a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> selecting it in a Stack Overflow survey, which you can read at the following link: <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/">https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-24" class="heading-3">GitHub Codespaces for development in the cloud</h3>
    <p class="normal">GitHub Codespaces is a fully configured development environment, based on VS Code, that can be spun up in <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>an environment hosted in the cloud and accessed through any web browser. It supports Git repos, extensions, and a built-in command-line interface, so you can edit, run, and test from any device.</p>
    <p class="normal">But note that for <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>your GitHub Codespaces experience to be fully functional and practically useful, it does have a license cost.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">More Information</strong>: You can learn more about GitHub Codespaces at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">https://github.com/features/codespaces</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-25" class="heading-3">Visual Studio for general development</h3>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio can create most types of applications, including console apps, websites, web services, and <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>desktop apps. Although you can use Visual Studio to write a cross-platform mobile app, you still need macOS and Xcode to compile it.</p>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio only runs on Windows 10 version 1909 or later, Home, Professional, Education, or Enterprise; or on Windows 11 version 21H2 or later, Home, Pro, Pro Education, Pro for Workstations, Enterprise, or Education. Windows Server 2016 and later are also supported. 32-bit operating systems and Windows S mode are <em class="italic">not</em> supported.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">Warning!</strong> Visual Studio for Mac does not officially support .NET 8 or later, and it reached its end of life in August 2024. If you have been using Visual Studio for Mac, then you should switch to VS Code for Mac, Rider for Mac, or use Visual Studio for Windows in a virtual machine on your local computer or in the cloud, using a technology like Microsoft Dev Box. The retirement announcement can be read here: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-for-mac-retirement-announcement/">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-for-mac-retirement-announcement/</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-26" class="heading-3">What I used</h3>
    <p class="normal">To write and test the code for this book, I used the following hardware and software:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Windows 11 on a Surface Laptop 7 Copilot+ PC with Visual Studio, VS Code, and Rider.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">macOS on<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> an Apple Silicon Mac mini (M1) desktop with VS Code and Rider.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">I hope that you have access to a variety of hardware and software too, as seeing the differences in platforms deepens your understanding of development challenges, although any one of the above combinations is enough to learn the fundamentals of C# and .NET and how to build practical apps and websites.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-27" class="heading-2">Deploying cross-platform</h2>
    <p class="normal">Your choice of code <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>editor and operating system for development does not limit where your code gets<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> deployed.</p>
    <p class="normal">.NET 9 supports the following platforms for deployment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Windows</strong>: Windows<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> 10 version 1607 or later, Windows 11 version 22000 or later, Windows Server 2012 R2 SP1 or later, and Nano Server version 2019 or 2022.</li>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-28" class="heading-2">Downloading and installing Visual Studio</h2>
    <p class="normal">Many professional .NET<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> developers use Visual Studio in their day-to-day <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>development work. Even if you <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>choose to use VS Code to complete the coding tasks in this book, you might want to familiarize<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> yourself with Visual Studio too. It is not until you have written a decent amount of code with a tool that you can really judge if it fits your needs.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you do not have a Windows <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>computer, then you can skip this section and continue to the next section, where you will download and install VS Code on macOS or Linux.</p>
    <p class="normal">Since October 2014, Microsoft <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>has made a professional-quality edition of Visual <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>Studio available to students, open-source contributors, and individuals for free. It is called Community Edition. Any of the editions are suitable for this book. If you have not already<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> installed it, let’s do so now:</p>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-30" class="heading-2">Downloading and installing VS Code</h2>
    <p class="normal">VS Code has rapidly improved<a id="_idIndexMarker036"/> over the past couple of years and has pleasantly <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>surprised Microsoft with<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> its popularity. If you are brave and like to live<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> on the bleeding edge, then there is the <strong class="keyWord">Insiders</strong> edition, which is a daily build of the next version.</p>
    <p class="normal">Even if you plan to only use Visual Studio for development, I recommend that you download and install VS <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>Code and try the coding tasks in this chapter using it, and then decide if you <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>want to stick with just using Visual Studio for the rest of the book.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let’s now download and install <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>VS Code, the .NET SDK, and the <strong class="keyWord">C# Dev Kit</strong> extension:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Download and install either the Stable build or the Insiders edition of VS Code from the following link: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>.</li>

    </ol>
    <div><p class="normal">In real life, you are extremely unlikely to only have one .NET SDK version installed on your computer. To learn how to control which .NET SDK version is used to build a project, we need multiple versions installed. .NET 8 and .NET 9 are the only supported versions at the time of publishing in November 2024. You can safely install multiple SDKs side by side. The most recent SDK will be used to build your projects.</p>
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="3">To install the <strong class="screenText">C# Dev Kit</strong> extension with a user interface, you must first launch the VS Code<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> application.</li>

    <p class="normal">While the <strong class="screenText">C#</strong> extension is not required, it provides IntelliSense as you type, code navigation, and debugging features, so it’s something that’s very handy to install and keep updated to support the latest C# language features.</p>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-35" class="heading-2">Understanding .NET support</h2>
    <p class="normal">.NET versions are either <strong class="keyWord">Long-Term Support</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">LTS</strong>), <strong class="keyWord">Standard-Term Support (STS)</strong> (formerly known as <strong class="keyWord">Current</strong>), or <strong class="keyWord">Preview</strong>, as described in the following list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">LTS</strong> releases are a good<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> choice for applications <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>that you do not intend to update frequently, although you must<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> update the .NET runtime for your production code monthly. LTS releases are supported by Microsoft for 3 years after <strong class="keyWord">General Availability</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">GA</strong>), or 1 year <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>after the next LTS release ships, whichever is longer.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">STS</strong> releases include features <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>that may change <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>based on feedback. These are a good choice for applications that you are actively developing because they provide access to the latest improvements. STS releases are supported by Microsoft for 18 months after GA, or 6 months after the next STS or LTS release ships, whichever is longer.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Preview</strong> releases are for public testing. These are a good choice for adventurous programmers <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>who want to live on the bleeding edge, or programming book authors who need to have early access to new language features, libraries, and app and service platforms. Preview releases are not usually supported by <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>Microsoft, but some preview or <strong class="keyWord">Release Candidate</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">RC</strong>) releases may be declared <strong class="keyWord">Go Live</strong>, meaning they are supported by Microsoft in production.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">STS and LTS releases receive critical patches throughout their lifetime for security and reliability.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Good Practice</strong>: You must stay up to date with the latest patches to get support. For example, if a system is running on .NET runtime version 9.0.0 and then version 9.0.1 is released, you must install version 9.0.1 to get support. These updates are released on the second Tuesday of each month, aka <strong class="keyWord">Patch Tuesday</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">To better understand your choices of STS and LTS releases, it is helpful to see them visualized, with 3-year-long black bars for LTS releases, and 1½-year-long gray bars for STS releases, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.3</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B22322_01_03.png" alt="" width="824" height="296"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.3: Support durations for recent and planned STS and LTS releases</p>
    <p class="normal">During the lifetime of .NET 9, .NET 8 will still be supported and .NET 10 will be released. I have tried to be<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> cognizant that you might choose to use .NET 8 or .NET 10 with this book; however, obviously, the book cannot cover new features of .NET 10, since I don’t know what they will be!</p>
    <p class="normal">If you need LTS from Microsoft, then set your .NET projects to target .NET 8 today and then migrate to .NET 10 after it is released in November 2025. This is because .NET 9 is an STS release, and therefore, it will lose support in May 2026, before .NET 8 does in November 2026. As soon as .NET 10 is released, start upgrading your .NET 8 projects to it. You will have a year to do so before .NET 8 reaches its end of life.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Good Practice</strong>: Remember that with all releases, you must upgrade to bug-fix releases like .NET runtime <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>9.0.1 and .NET SDK 9.0.101, which are expected to release in December 2024, as updates are released every month.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">At the time of publishing in November 2024, all versions of modern .NET have reached their EOL, except those shown in the following list, which are ordered by their EOL dates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">.NET 9 will reach EOL in May 2026.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">.NET 8 will reach EOL in November 2026.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">.NET 10 will be available from November 2025 and it will reach EOL in November 2028.</li>
    </ul>
    <div><p class="normal">You can check <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>which .NET versions are currently supported and when they will reach EOL at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md">https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-36" class="heading-2">Understanding end of life (EOL)</h2>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">End of support</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">end of life</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">EOL</strong>) means the date after which bug fixes, security updates, or<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> technical assistance are<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> no longer available from Microsoft.</p>
    <p class="normal">For example, now that .NET 6 has reached end of support on November 12, 2024, you can expect the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Projects that use .NET 6 will continue to run.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">No new security updates will be issued for .NET 6 and therefore continuing to use an unsupported version will increasingly expose you to security vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">You might not be able to access technical support for any .NET 6 applications that you continue to use.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">You will get <code class="inlineCode">NETSDK1138</code> build warnings when targeting .NET 6 from a later SDK like the .NET 9 <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>SDK.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">You will get warnings in Visual Studio when targeting .NET 6.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-37" class="heading-2">Understanding .NET support phases</h2>
    <p class="normal">The lifetime of a version of .NET<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> passes through several phases, during which they have varying levels of support, as described in the following list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Preview</strong>: These are not supported at all. .NET 9 Preview 1 to Preview 7 were in this support <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>phase from February 2024 to August 2024.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Go Live</strong>: These are supported until GA, and then they become immediately unsupported. You must upgrade to the final release version as soon as it is <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>available. .NET 9 Release Candidate 1 and Release Candidate 2 were in this support phase in September and October 2024, respectively.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Active</strong>: .NET 9 will be in this<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> support phase from November 2024 to November 2025.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Maintenance</strong>: Supported<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> only with security fixes for the last 6 months <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>of its lifetime. .NET 9 will be in this support phase from November 2025 to May 2026.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">EOL</strong>: Not <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>supported. .NET 9 will reach its EOL in May 2026.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-38" class="heading-2">Understanding .NET runtime and .NET SDK versions</h2>
    <p class="normal">If you have not built a standalone app, then the .NET runtime is the minimum you need to install so that an operating system can run a .NET application. The .NET SDK includes the .NET runtime, as well as the compilers and other tools needed to build .NET code and apps.</p>
    <p class="normal">.NET runtime <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>versioning follows semantic versioning – that is, a major increment indicates breaking changes, minor increments indicate new features, and patch increments indicate bug fixes.</p>
    <p class="normal">.NET SDK versioning does<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> not follow semantic versioning. The major and minor version numbers are tied to the runtime version they are matched with. The third number follows a convention that indicates the minor and patch versions of the SDK. The third number starts at 100 for the initial version (equivalent to 0.0 for the minor and patch numbers). The first digit increments with minor increments, and the other two digits increment with patch increments.</p>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-39" class="heading-2">Listing and removing versions of .NET</h2>
    <p class="normal">.NET runtime updates are<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> compatible with a major version such as 9.x, and updated releases of the .NET SDK maintain the ability to build applications that<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> target previous versions of the runtime, which enables the safe removal of older versions.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can see which SDKs and runtimes are currently installed using the following commands:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">dotnet --list-sdks
dotnet --list-runtimes
dotnet --info
</code></pre>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Good Practice</strong>: To make it easier to enter commands at the command prompt or terminal, the following link lists all commands throughout the book that can be easily copied and pasted: <a href="https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/command-lines.md">https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/command-lines.md</a>.</p>

    <p class="normal">On Windows, use <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>the <strong class="screenText">Apps &amp; features</strong> section to remove .NET SDKs.</p>
    <p class="normal">On Linux, there is <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>no single mechanism, but you can learn more at the following link:</p>

    <div><p class="normal">You could use a third-party tool like Dots, the friendly .NET SDK manager, found at the following link: <a href="https://johnnys.news/2023/01/Dots-a-dotnet-SDK-manager">https://johnnys.news/2023/01/Dots-a-dotnet-SDK-manager</a>. At the time of writing, you must build the app from source on its GitHub repository, so I only recommend that for advanced developers.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-40" class="heading-2">Understanding intermediate language</h2>
    <p class="normal">The C# compiler (named <strong class="keyWord">Roslyn</strong>) used by <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>the <code class="inlineCode">dotnet</code> CLI tool converts your C# source code into <strong class="keyWord">intermediate language</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IL</strong>) code and stores the IL in <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>an <strong class="keyWord">assembly</strong> (a DLL or EXE file). IL<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> code statements are like assembly language instructions, which are executed by .NET’s virtual machine, known as CoreCLR, the <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>newer name for the <strong class="keyWord">Common Language Runtime (CLR)</strong> in modern .NET. The legacy .NET Framework has a CLR that is <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>Windows-only, and modern .NET has one for each OS, like Windows, macOS, and Linux. These days, they are all commonly referred to as CLRs.</p>
    <p class="normal">At runtime, CoreCLR loads the IL code<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> from the assembly, the <strong class="keyWord">just-in-time</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">JIT</strong>) compiler compiles it into native CPU instructions, and then it is executed by the CPU on your machine.</p>
    <p class="normal">The benefit of this two-step compilation process is that Microsoft can create <strong class="keyWord">CLRs</strong> for Linux and macOS, as well as for Windows. The same IL code runs everywhere because of the second compilation step, which generates code for the native operating system and CPU instruction set.</p>
    <p class="normal">Regardless of which language the source code is written in (for example, C#, Visual Basic, or F#), all .NET applications use IL code for their instructions stored in an assembly. Microsoft and others provide disassembler tools that can open an assembly and reveal this IL code, such as the ILSpy .NET Decompiler extension. You will learn <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>more about this in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Packaging and Distributing .NET Types</em>, in an online section found at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/ch07-decompiling.md">https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/ch07-decompiling.md</a>.</p>
    <p class="normal">So, the compilation process typically involves translating source code into IL, which is then compiled into machine code <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>at runtime by the CLR using JIT compilation. <strong class="keyWord">Ahead-of-Time (AOT)</strong> compilation is an alternative to this approach, and you will learn about it in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Packaging and Distributing .NET Types</em>.</p>

    <p class="normal">Two compiler-generated folders were created, named <code class="inlineCode">obj</code> and <code class="inlineCode">bin</code>, as described in the following list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">The <code class="inlineCode">obj</code> folder contains <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>one compiled <em class="italic">object</em> file for each source code file. These objects haven’t been linked together into a final executable yet.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">The <code class="inlineCode">bin</code> folder contains the <em class="italic">binary</em> executable for the application or class library.

    </ul>
    <p class="normal">You do not need to look inside these folders or understand their files yet (but feel free to browse around if you are curious).</p>
    <p class="normal">Just be aware that the compiler needs to create temporary folders and files to do its work. You could delete these folders and their files, and they will be automatically recreated the next time you “build” or run the project. Developers often delete these temporary folders and files to “clean” a project. Visual Studio even has a command on the <strong class="screenText">Build</strong> menu named <strong class="screenText">Clean Solution</strong> that deletes some of these temporary files for you. The equivalent command with the CLI is <code class="inlineCode">dotnet clean</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-46" class="heading-2">Understanding top-level programs</h2>
    <p class="normal">If you have seen older .NET projects before, then you might have expected more code, even just to output a simple message. This project has minimal statements because some of the required code is <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>written for you by the compiler when you target .NET 6 or later.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you had created the project with .NET SDK 5 or earlier, or if you had selected the checkbox labeled <strong class="screenText">Do not use top-level statements</strong>, then the <code class="inlineCode">Program.cs</code> file would have more statements, as shown in the following code:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System;
namespace HelloCS
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">During compilation with .NET SDK 6 or later, all the boilerplate code to define the <code class="inlineCode">Program</code> class and its <code class="inlineCode">Main</code> method is<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> generated and wrapped around the statements you write.</p>
    <p class="normal">This uses a feature introduced in .NET 5 <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>called <strong class="keyWord">top-level programs</strong>, but it was not until .NET 6 that Microsoft updated the project template for console apps to use top-level statements by default. Then, in .NET 7 and later, Microsoft added options to use the older style if you prefer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">If you are using Visual Studio, select the checkbox labeled <strong class="screenText">Do not use top-level statements</strong>.</li>
      <li class="bulletList">If you are using the <code class="inlineCode">dotnet</code> CLI at the command prompt, add a switch:
        <pre class="programlisting con-one"><code class="hljs-con">dotnet new console --use-program-main
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Warning!</strong> One functional difference is that the auto-generated code does not define a namespace, so the <code class="inlineCode">Program</code> class is implicitly defined in an empty namespace with no name, instead of a namespace that matches the name of the project.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-47" class="heading-2">Requirements for top-level programs</h2>
    <p class="normal">Key points to remember <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>about top-level programs include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">There can be only one file like the file you use for top-level program code in a project.</li>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-48" class="heading-2">Implicitly imported namespaces</h2>
    <p class="normal">The <code class="inlineCode">using System;</code> statement at the top of the file imports the <code class="inlineCode">System</code> namespace.

    <p class="normal">The trick is that we still need to import the <code class="inlineCode">System</code> namespace, but it is now done for us using a combination of features introduced in C# 10 and .NET 6. Let’s see how:</p>

      <li class="numberedList">Note that this file is automatically created by the compiler for projects that target .NET 6 or later and uses a feature introduced in C# 10, called <strong class="keyWord">global namespace imports</strong>, which imports some commonly used <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>namespaces like <code class="inlineCode">System</code> for use in all code files, as <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>shown in the following code:
        <pre class="programlisting code-one"><code class="hljs-code">// &lt;autogenerated /&gt;

If you want to open the same project in both Visual Studio and VS Code, delete the temporary <code class="inlineCode">bin</code> and <code class="inlineCode">obj</code> folders before opening the project in the other code editor. This potential problem is why I asked you to create a different folder for the VS Code projects in this chapter.</p>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-62" class="heading-2">Avoiding common mistakes</h2>
    <p class="normal">After working through the step-by-step tasks in this book, readers often then strike out on their own and attempt to write similar code, but sometimes, they hit problems and either raise an issue in the GitHub repository or post a question to the Discord channel for the book.</p>
    <p class="normal">From these, I have noted some common mistakes, so I maintain a page in the repository to highlight and explain these potential traps and how to fix them:</p>
    <p class="normal"><a href="https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/errata/common-mistakes.md">https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/errata/common-mistakes.md</a></p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-63" class="heading-2">Downloading solution code from the GitHub repository</h2>

    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Good Practice</strong>: It is best to clone or download the code solutions to a short folder path, like <code class="inlineCode">C:\cs13net9\</code> or <code class="inlineCode">C:\book\</code>, to avoid build-generated files that exceed the maximum path length. You should also avoid special characters like <code class="inlineCode">#</code>. For example, do not use a folder name like <code class="inlineCode">C:\C# projects\</code>. That folder name might work for a simple console app project, but once you start adding features that automatically generate code, you are likely to have strange issues. Keep your folder names short and simple.</p>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-64" class="heading-2">Using Git with VS Code and the command prompt</h2>
    <p class="normal">VS Code has integrations with <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>Git, but it will use your operating system’s Git installation, so you must install Git 2 or later first before you get these features.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can install Git from the following link: <a href="https://git-scm.com/download">https://git-scm.com/download</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-65" class="heading-2">Cloning the book solution code repository</h2>
    <p class="normal">Let’s clone the book solution code repository. In the steps that follow, you will use the VS Code terminal, but you can enter the commands at any command prompt or terminal window:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Create a folder named <code class="inlineCode">Repos-vscode</code> in your <code class="inlineCode">user</code> or <code class="inlineCode">Documents</code> folder, or wherever you want to store your Git repositories.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Open the <code class="inlineCode">Repos-vscode</code> folder at the command prompt or terminal, and then enter the following command:
        <pre class="programlisting con-one"><code class="hljs-con">git clone https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9.git
</code></pre>
      </li>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-68" class="heading-2">Documentation links in this book</h2>
    <p class="normal">The official Microsoft documentation for .NET needs to cover all versions. The default version shown in the documentation is always the most recent GA version.</p>
    <p class="normal">For example, between November 2024 and November 2025, the default version of .NET shown in the documentation pages will be for .NET 9. Between November 2025 and November 2026, the default version of .NET will be for .NET 10. The following link will automatically direct to the current version, depending on the current date:</p>
    <p class="normal"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.stringsyntaxattribute">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.stringsyntaxattribute</a></p>
    <p class="normal">After November 2025, to view the documentation page specifically for .NET 9, append <code class="inlineCode">?view=net-9.0</code> to the end of a link. For example, use the following link:</p>
    <p class="normal"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.stringsyntaxattribute?view=net-9.0">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.stringsyntaxattribute?view=net-9.0</a></p>
    <p class="normal">All documentation links in this book do not specify a version. If you want to force the documentation to show the version for .NET 8 because you need to target an LTS version (three years) instead of .NET 9, which is an STS version (18 months), then append <code class="inlineCode">?view=net-8.0</code> to the end of a link.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can check what versions a .NET feature supports by appending <code class="inlineCode">#applies-to</code> to the end of a link, for example:</p>
    <p class="normal"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.stringsyntaxattribute#applies-to">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.stringsyntaxattribute#applies-to</a></p>
    <p class="normal">We can, therefore, see that the <code class="inlineCode">StringSyntax</code> attribute is only available in .NET 7 or later.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-69" class="heading-2">Getting help from the dotnet tool</h2>
    <p class="normal">At the command prompt, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>ask the <code class="inlineCode">dotnet</code> tool for help with its commands. The syntax is:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">dotnet help &lt;command&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This will cause your web browser to open a page in the documentation about the specified command. Common <code class="inlineCode">dotnet</code> commands include <code class="inlineCode">new</code>, <code class="inlineCode">build</code>, <code class="inlineCode">run</code>, and many more.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Warning!</strong> The <code class="inlineCode">dotnet help new</code> command worked with .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 6, but it returns an error with .NET 7 or later: <code class="inlineCode">Specified command 'new' is not a valid SDK command. Specify a valid SDK command. For more information, run dotnet help.</code> Hopefully, .NET will fix that bug soon!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Another type of help is command-line documentation. It follows this syntax:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">dotnet &lt;command&gt; -?|-h|--help
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">For example, <code class="inlineCode">dotnet new -?</code> or <code class="inlineCode">dotnet new -h</code> or <code class="inlineCode">dotnet new --help</code> outputs documentation about the <code class="inlineCode">new</code> command at the command prompt.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">As you should now expect, <code class="inlineCode">dotnet help help</code> opens a web browser for the <code class="inlineCode">help</code> command, and <code class="inlineCode">dotnet help -h</code> outputs documentation for the <code class="inlineCode">help</code> command at the command prompt!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Let’s try some examples:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">To open the official documentation in a web browser window for the <code class="inlineCode">dotnet build</code> command, enter the following at the command prompt or in the VS Code terminal, and note the page opened in your web browser:
        <pre class="programlisting con-one"><code class="hljs-con">dotnet help build
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">To get help output at the command prompt, use the <code class="inlineCode">-?</code> or <code class="inlineCode">-h</code> or <code class="inlineCode">--help</code> flag, as shown in the following command:
        <pre class="programlisting con-one"><code class="hljs-con">dotnet build -?
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="numberedList">You will see the <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>following partial output:

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-70" class="heading-2">Getting definitions of types and their members</h2>
    <p class="normal">One of the most useful features of a code editor is <strong class="keyWord">Go To Definition</strong> (<em class="keystroke">F12</em>). It is available in VS Code, Visual Studio, and <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>Rider. It will show what the public definition of the type or member looks like by reading the metadata in the compiled assembly.</p>
    <p class="normal">Some tools, such as ILSpy .NET Decompiler, will even reverse-engineer the metadata and IL code back into C# or another language for you.</p>
    <p class="normal">A similar and related feature is named <strong class="keyWord">Go To Implementation</strong> (<em class="keystroke">Ctrl</em> + <em class="keystroke">F12</em>). Instead of reading the metadata or <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>decompiling, this will show the actual source code if that is embedded, using the optional source link feature.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Warning!</strong> <strong class="screenText">Go To Definition</strong> should go to the decompiled metadata for a member or type. But if you have previously viewed the source link, then it goes to that. <strong class="screenText">Go To Implementation</strong> should go to the source link implementation for a member or type. But if you have disabled the source link, then it goes to the decompiled metadata.</p>

    <p class="normal">Be patient for a little longer. You are almost at the end of this chapter, and in the next chapter, you will dive into the details of the C# language. But first, let’s see where else you can look for help.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-72" class="heading-2">Looking for answers on Stack Overflow</h2>
    <p class="normal">Stack Overflow is the most popular <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>third-party website for getting answers to difficult programming questions. Let’s see an example:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Start your favorite web browser.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Navigate to <code class="inlineCode">stackoverflow.com</code>; in the search box, enter <code class="inlineCode">securestring</code> and note the search results.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-73" class="heading-2">Searching for answers using Google</h2>
    <p class="normal">You can search Google with advanced search options to increase the likelihood of finding what you need:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="numberedList" value="1">Navigate to Google at the <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>following link: <a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com/</a>.</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Search for information about <code class="inlineCode">garbage collection</code> using a simple Google query, and note that you will probably see a lot of ads for garbage collection services in your local area before you see the Wikipedia definition of garbage collection in computer science!</li>
      <li class="numberedList">Improve the search by restricting it to a useful site such as Stack Overflow, by removing languages that we might not care about, such as C++, Rust, and Python, or by adding C# and .NET explicitly, as shown in the following search query:
        <pre class="programlisting code-one"><code class="hljs-code">garbage collection site:stackoverflow.com +C# -Java
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-74" class="heading-2">Getting help on Discord and other chat forums</h2>
    <p class="normal">Asking questions in programming forums and Discord channels is an art as much as it is a science. To maximize your <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>chances of receiving a helpful answer, there’s a blend of clarity, specificity, and community awareness that you should aim for.</p>
    <p class="normal">Here are some tips for asking questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Ask in a public channel, not in private. Please do not direct message an author with a question or a friend request. </strong>Remember, every question asked and answered builds the collective knowledge and resourcefulness of the whole community. Asking in public also allows other readers to help you, not just the author. The community that Packt and I have built around my books is friendly and smart. Let us <em class="italic">all</em> help you.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Research before asking</strong>: It’s important to look for answers yourself before turning to the community. Use search engines, official documentation, and the search function within the forum or Discord server. This not only respects the community’s time but also helps you learn more effectively. Another place to look first is the errata and improvements section of the book, found at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/errata/README.md">https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/docs/errata/README.md</a>.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Be specific and concise</strong>: Clearly state what you’re trying to achieve, what you’ve tried so far, and where you’re stuck. A concise question is more likely to get a quick response.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Specify the book location</strong>: If you are stuck on a particular part of the book, specify the page number and section title so that others can look up the context of your question.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Show your work</strong>: Demonstrating that you’ve made an effort to solve the problem yourself not only provides context but also helps others understand your thought process and where you might have gone down a wrong path.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Prepare your question</strong>: Avoid too broad or vague questions. Screenshots of errors or code snippets (with proper formatting) can be very helpful.<div><p class="normal">Oddly, I’ve been seeing more and more examples of readers taking photos of their screens and posting those. These are harder to read and limited in what they can show. It’s better to copy and paste the text of your code or the error message so that others can copy and paste it themselves. Alternatively, at least take a high-resolution screenshot instead of a photo with your phone camera at a jaunty angle!</p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Format your code properly</strong>: Most forums and Discord servers support code formatting using Markdown syntax. Use formatting to make your code more readable. For example, surround code keywords in single backticks, like <code class="inlineCode">`public void`</code>, and surround code blocks with three backticks with optional language code, as shown in the following code:
        <pre class="programlisting code-one"><code class="hljs-code">```cs
using static System.Console;
WriteLine("This is C# formatted code.");
```
</code></pre>
        <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Good Practice</strong>: After the three backticks that start a code block in Markdown, specify a language short name like<strong class="keyWord"> </strong><code class="inlineCode">cs</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">csharp</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">js</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">javascript</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">json</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">html</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">css</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">cpp</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">xml</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">mermaid</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">python</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">java</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">ruby</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">go</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">sql</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong><code class="inlineCode">bash</code><strong class="keyWord">, </strong>or <code class="inlineCode">shell</code><strong class="keyWord">.</strong></p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">More Information</strong>: To learn how to format text in Discord channel messages, see the following link: <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline">https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline</a><strong class="keyWord">.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Be polite and patient</strong>: Remember, you’re asking for help from people who are giving their time voluntarily. A polite tone and patience while waiting for a response go a long way. Channel participants are often in a different time zone, so you may not see your question answered until the next day.</li>
      <li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Be ready to actively participate</strong>: After asking your question, stay engaged. You might receive follow-up questions for clarification. Responding promptly and clearly can significantly increase your chances of getting a helpful answer. When I ask a question, I set an alarm for three hours later to go back and see if anyone has responded. If there hasn’t been a response yet, then I set another alarm for 24 hours later.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Incorporating these approaches when asking questions not only increases your likelihood of getting a useful response but also contributes positively to the community, by showing respect for others’ time and effort.</p>
    <div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Good Practice</strong>: Never just say “Hello” as a message on any chat system. You can read why at the following link: <a href="https://nohello.net/">https://nohello.net/</a>. Similarly, don’t ask to ask: <a href="https://dontasktoask.com/">https://dontasktoask.com/</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-79" class="heading-2">AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot</h2>
    <p class="normal">One of the biggest changes in coding and <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>development in the past few years is the emergence of generative <strong class="keyWord">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">AI</strong>) tools that can help with coding tasks, like completing a <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>code statement, implementing an entire function, writing unit tests, and suggesting debugging fixes for existing code.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can read what developers say about AI tools in the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey: “44% of them use AI tools in their development process now, and 26% plan to soon” (<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/14/hype-or-not-developers-have-something-to-say-about-ai/">https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/14/hype-or-not-developers-have-something-to-say-about-ai/</a>):</p>
    <blockquote class="packt_quote">
      <p class="quote">“From research to debugging to documentation, developers are using Generative AI to save time doing various tedious tasks at work. The biggest use case is writing code. This was how 82.55% of developers reported using Generative AI in the recent Stack Overflow Developer Survey.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="normal">ChatGPT currently has several models for individuals: 4o mini (free), 4o (free but limited), and 4o with 5x more requests and other benefits, like early access to new features and DALL·E image generation ($20 per month). It also has pricing for enterprises. You can check their pricing at the following link: <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/">https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-80" class="heading-3">ChatGPT example</h3>
    <p class="normal">Let’s say you need to write<a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> a C# function to validate an email address. You might go to ChatGPT and enter the following prompt:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">write a c# function to validate an email address
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">It responds with a complete class with methods, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.16</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B22322_01_16.png" alt="" width="878" height="514"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.16: ChatGPT writes a function to validate an email address</p>
    <p class="normal">It then provides an explanation of the code and examples of how to call the function, as shown in the following code:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">bool isValid = EmailValidator.IsValidEmail("test@example.com");
Console.WriteLine(isValid ? "Valid" : "Invalid");
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">But is a general-purpose<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> generative AI like ChatGPT the best partner for a C# programmer?</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-81" class="heading-3">GitHub Copilot for programmers</h3>
    <p class="normal">Microsoft has a service specifically for<a id="_idIndexMarker179"/> programmers, named GitHub Copilot, that can help autocomplete code directly in your code editor. It has plugins for code editors, including Visual Studio, VS Code, and JetBrains IntelliJ-based IDEs.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">Personally, I really like the Copilot branding. It makes it clear that you are the pilot. You are ultimately responsible for “flying the plane.” But for the easy or boring bits, you can hand it over to your co-pilot for a bit, while being actively ready to take back control if needed.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">GitHub Copilot</strong> is free for students, teachers, and some open-source project maintainers. For everyone else, it has a 30-day free trial, and then it costs $10 per month or $100 per year for individuals. Once you have an account, you can then sign up for waiting lists to get the more advanced experimental GitHub Copilot features.</p>
    <p class="normal">You should check online which Copilot features are available for various code editors. As you can imagine, this is a fast-changing world, and some of what I might write in the book today will be out of date by the time you read it: <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">https://github.com/features/copilot</a>.</p>
    <div><p class="normal">JetBrains has its own GitHub Copilot equivalent, named AI Assistant, which you can read about at the following link: <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2023/06/ai-assistant-in-jetbrains-ides/">https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2023/06/ai-assistant-in-jetbrains-ides/</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">So what can GitHub Copilot do for you today?</p>
    <p class="normal">Imagine that you have<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> just added a new class file named <code class="inlineCode">Product.cs</code>. You click inside the <code class="inlineCode">Product</code> class, press <em class="keystroke">Enter</em> to insert a blank line, and then pause for a second as you think about what you need to type… and then GitHub Copilot generates some sample code in gray, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.17</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B22322_01_17.png" alt="" width="877" height="394"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.17: GitHub Copilot suggesting how to define a Product class</p>
    <p class="normal">At this point, you can glance over the code and, if it is close to what you want, just press <em class="keystroke">Tab</em> to insert it all, or press <em class="keystroke">Alt</em> + <em class="keystroke">.</em> (dot) to toggle between other suggestions.</p>
    <p class="normal">Sometimes, it is too far from what you need, and you’d be better off ignoring its suggestion completely and just writing it yourself. But usually, there’s something there that’s usable or reminds you of the syntax you need to use. And sometimes, it feels like magic, writing dozens of lines of exactly what you need.</p>
    <p class="normal">Microsoft feeds its AI tools with code from public GitHub repositories, including all the repositories I have created since 2016 for all the editions of this book. This means that it can suggest code completions for the readers of this book that are surprisingly accurate predictions, including my frequent use of pop culture references in my code. It’s like I, Mark J. Price, am the “ghost in the machine” guiding your coding.</p>
    <p class="normal">It’s easy to imagine a custom ChatGPT that has ingested all the official Microsoft .NET documentation, every<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> public blog article written about .NET, and perhaps even hundreds of books about .NET, and then having a conversation with it to find a bug or suggest how to solve a programming problem.</p>

    <p class="normal">The key quote at the preceding Reddit link is this:</p>
    <blockquote class="packt_quote">
      <p class="quote">“There’s been a lot of hype around Rust, and for good reason. But it’s a system language. It’s not like Microsoft is about to go rewrite millions and millions of lines of code and toss out C# (for anyone getting nervous <img src="img/1.png" alt="" width="21" height="19"/>). They’re just being pragmatic and using an effective tool for the job.”</p>
