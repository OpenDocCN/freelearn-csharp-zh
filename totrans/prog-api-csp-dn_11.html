     What’s Next?
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     By this point, you’ve seen and worked with the fundamentals and advanced topics of creating .NET APIs.
    
    
     The obvious question is,
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      “What next?”
     
    </em>
    
     There are a number of areas where you may want to expand your knowledge and expertise.
    
    
     This chapter will list some of the most
    
    
     
      important ones.
     
    
   </p>
   <h2 id="_idParaDest-155">

     C#
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     The #1 place to put your effort is advanced C#.
    
    
     The more you know about C#, the easier it will be to create world-class APIs.
    
    
     Pay particular attention to Linq as much of your retrieval code will make extensive use of it.
    
    
     Even if you don’t write in Linq, other API creators will, and you’ll need a solid working knowledge of Linq to understand
    
    
     
      their work.

     SQL
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     The next most important place to put your effort is expanding your SQL skills.
    
    
     The API programmer is, very often, called upon to retrieve the requested data from a database, and in most cases, that will require a working knowledge
    
    
     
      of SQL.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Note that there are different flavors of SQL depending on what database you are using; however, the core of SQL is the same
    
    
     
      across platforms.
     
    
   </p>
   <h2 id="_idParaDest-157">
    <a id="_idTextAnchor157">
    </a>
    
     Database
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     In addition to expanding your SQL skills, you will want to become as proficient as you can in the database platform you’re working with (e.g., Entity Framework).
    
    
     As noted previously, the SQL you’ll use will vary a bit depending on which platform you choose (or was chosen
    
    
     
      for you).

     API architecture
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     There are numerous books that delve into the finer points of architecting APIs.
    
    
     They can be very helpful when designing a very
    
    
     
      complex API.
     
    
   </p>
   <h2 id="_idParaDest-159">

     Dapper
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     Dapper is a powerful object relational mapper that we’ve been using throughout this book.
    
    
     There is more to Dapper than we’ve needed, however, and it will be valuable to learn some of the more advanced features.
    
    
     You can learn more about Dapper

     AutoMapper
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     We used AutoMapper to map our DTOs to their related
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Plain Old C# Objects
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      POCOs
     
    </strong>
    
     ) objects.
    
    
     AutoMapper can map any two objects, which can come in handy in solving more advanced API issues.

     Visual Studio
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     Visual Studio is your primary tool for creating APIs, and the more you can learn about it, the easier your life will be.
    
    
     Pay particular attention to creating snippets as they can save you a lot of time.
    
    
     There are a great many features in Visual Studio that we didn’t need to go into but are worth learning about.
    
    
     Be sure to become proficient in using Visual Studio to interact with your version
    
    
     
      control system.

     Git
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     As discussed in the book, while there are other version control systems, the great majority of the C# community (and most other programming languages and platforms) has settled on Git.
    
    
     Becoming proficient in Git in both Visual Studio and at the command line will save you a great deal of time and can prevent panic when you think you’ve lost your work (you almost certainly
    
    
     
      have not).
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In addition to the numerous tutorials available online, I have a book,
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      Git For Programmers
     
    </em>
    
     , published by Packt, that covers using Git in both the command line and
    
    
     
      Visual Studio.

     Housing your version control
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     There are three very popular places to house your
    
    
     
      Git repository:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     
      
       On-premises
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      
       On GitHub
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      
       On Azure
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     On-premises simply means that your Git repository is on your own computer.
    
    
     This can be convenient, but also dangerous.
    
    
     If your repository is on a local computer, damage to that computer can cause your work and work history to
    
    
     
      be lost.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Microsoft offers two homes for Git.
    
    
     GitHub is popular with open source and smaller applications.
    
    
     For open source applications and small individual users, it is free.
    
    
     The alternative is to put your repository on Azure Repos.
    
    
     Azure DevOps offers a limited free tier, which may suffice for small teams or individual users.
    
    
     It also provides several paid tiers that include additional features tailored for larger projects and more complex
    
    
     
      team requirements.
