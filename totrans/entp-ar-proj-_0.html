<p class="mce-root"><strong>Augmented reality</strong> (<strong>AR</strong>) is an amazing technology that dates back to the 1990s and was mostly unknown to the general public until the appearance of Google Glass and the release of the AR-based game Pokemon Go. Although, initially, it was mainly used in marketing to get the <em>wow effect</em>, it has since proved to be a natural interface for the user in many other fields, such as tourism, industry, medicine, and education. Its versatility of features (based on image or physical world recognition, GPS location, and more) and target devices (Android/iOS mobile devices, computer, web, and <strong>Head Mounted Displays</strong> (<strong>HMD</strong>)) makes it the perfect complement for different sectors and implementations such as industrial guides, live art experiences, and training tools.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><em>Enterprise Augmented Reality Projects</em> aims to take you on a journey of developing and building applications with AR using the best-known frameworks on the market. In this book, we'll explore the aspects of developing AR-based applications for six different enterprise sectors (manufacturing, training, marketing, retail, automation, and tourism) in detail, starting from the market needs and choosing the most suitable tool in each case. Each chapter will cover a new use of AR by using a different framework or target device.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The first chapter will be an introduction to AR so that you will have a good understanding of its uses and potential before starting to code. Next, we'll introduce you to Unity, an amazing 3D tool that will simplify the task of integrating AR frameworks and manipulating 3D objects and scenes in many of the chapters. Then, we'll work with Android Studio and ARCore to create our first augmented project for prototyping. Afterward, we will explore both WebAR with the Google Web Component <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd>, and the emerging AR authoring tool, Augmented Class!, for education. Next, we will start working with Unity to integrate the AR framework, EasyAR, to create an AR catalog for a marketing experience. We will then continue with the Vuforia framework and use it retail. Furthermore, we will use Vuforia combined with AR glasses to create a step-by-step guide for an automation process. We will then end the book with ARKit, developed, in this case, inside Xcode, to implement an augmented dimensional portal for tourism.</p>

<p><em>Enterprise Augmented Reality Projects</em> is aimed at enthusiasts of emerging and interactive technologies interested in building AR applications for any field step by step, and learning about the latest tools to develop them. No prior AR experience is required. Some object-oriented programming skills would be helpful.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What this book covers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><a href="c5172027-e3f1-4236-bcfa-d76ac241f55e.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introduction to AR and How it Fits the Enterprise</em>, starts off the book by introducing AR and its uses. It covers the origins of the technology, types of AR that can be developed, the frameworks you will be using through the book, and the main uses of AR in different enterprise sectors.</p>
<p><a href="54a1260e-a741-4eb5-9c98-01350fcba94b.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Introduction to Unity for AR Development</em>, is an introduction to the real-time 3D development platform Unity, where you will learn the nomenclature and uses of the main elements. You will also learn how to create a first script in C# to see the potential of this tool.</p>
<p><a href="2d2b4e6f-1ee8-46ab-9041-24e36d57f949.xhtml"/><a href="2d2b4e6f-1ee8-46ab-9041-24e36d57f949.xhtml"/><a href="2d2b4e6f-1ee8-46ab-9041-24e36d57f949.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>AR for Manufacturing with ARCore</em>, introduces the ARCore technology and how to implement its surface detection features. You will create a prototype viewer for Android using Android Studio and the Sceneform plugin, which will help us to easily integrate 3D models in our project.</p>
<p><a href="d97f5549-4c50-43cd-a944-7fb0288ddebf.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>AR for Training with WebAR and Augmented Class!</em>, explores two different tools in a common project for training purposes. With WebAR, you will learn how to develop a simple web app that includes the <kbd>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</kbd> web component, which will be used to launch AR from an ARCore-supporting mobile device. Augmented Class! is an authoring tool for Android that's used to easily create interactive educational AR projects.</p>
<p><a href="a35bc701-516c-47dc-abb1-f6494cacf5af.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>AR for Marketing with EasyAR</em>, introduces you to using Unity to develop AR projects with the EasyAR framework. You will learn how to develop an augmented catalog based on image tracking and how to create interfaces in Unity and link them to scripts and objects in the scene.</p>
<p><a href="3ef942da-7d11-444e-b3e9-ddbf24bb2d09.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>AR for Retail with Vuforia</em>, teaches you how to use Vuforia's ground detection features inside Unity to place 3D objects over flat surfaces and move/rotate/scale them, with the possibility of adding ARCore on top of Vuforia. All the while, you will work further with Unity and its components to reinforce previous concepts.</p>
<p><a href="4ee2c3b3-2856-4b78-a17c-5575cafafc3b.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>AR for Automation with Vuforia and AR Glasses</em>, continues developing with the Vuforia framework but oriented in this case to building on AR glasses. You will learn about the similarities and differences between mobile and glasses-oriented apps while creating an augmented guide for an automation process.</p>
<p><a href="4c04e2f4-ef78-4061-bf73-41777381d9ad.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>AR for Tourism with ARKit</em>, developed over Xcode and aimed at iOS devices. In this chapter, you will create an augmented portal anchored to the real world that will transport the user to a hidden virtual world. To do this, you will also learn how to work with the SceneKit framework to create 3D scenes and display 3D models.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">To get the most out of this book</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To get the most of this book, no prior AR or Unity experience is required as they will be covered in detail. Similarly, prior understanding of Android Studio and Xcode would be helpful, but is not required. Object-oriented programming skills would be helpful as we will be using Java, C#, and Swift for our projects. However, if you follow the steps in the book and copy and paste the code, you will be able to build all the projects from scratch.<br/>
<br/>
Every chapter will contain the installation instructions and information you will need to implement each project.</p>
<p>VS: Although VS2019 is out, we are using 2017 as it comes integrated with Unity and will ensure it works directly without further configuration.</p>
<p class="mce-root">JDK: Any version of JDK 8 and above from the new OpenJDK should be functional but specifying that to avoid errors, the version 8 works.</p>
