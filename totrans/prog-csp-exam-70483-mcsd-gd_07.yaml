- en: Exception handling helps developers structure their programs in a way that helps
    them handle both expected and unexpected scenarios. Often, application logic may
    throw some form of unhandled exception, for example, a code block trying to write
    to a file on a system that ends up with a file with a use exception. Such scenarios
    can be handled if proper exception handling is in place.

- en: Exception handling uses the `try`, `catch`, and `finally` keywords to allow
    us to write code that may not succeed and can be handled when required, as well
    as to help us clean up resources once the `try` block has been executed. These
    exceptions can be thrown by CLR, .NET Framework, or by external libraries that
    are used in your code.

- en: Exceptions are types that are derived from the `System.Exception` class. We
    use the `try` block around statements that may throw an exception. When an exception
    occurs, control jumps to the `catch` statement, where CLR collects all the required
    stack trace information before terminating the program and displaying a message
    to the user. If exception handling is not done, the program just terminates with
    an error. While handling exceptions, it is important to understand that if we
    cannot handle an exception, we should not catch it. This ensures that the application
    will be in a known state. When you define a `catch` block, you define an exception
    variable that can be used to obtain more information, such as the origin of the
    exception, which line in the code threw this exception, the type of exception,
    and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A programmer can create and throw exceptions from the application logic using
    the throw keyword. Each `try` block may or may not define the `finally` block,
    which will be executed whether an exception is thrown or not. This block helps
    us release resources that have been used in the code block. Alternatively, if
    you want a piece of code to execute in all scenarios, it can be placed in the
    `finally` block.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the upcoming sections, we will look at how we can use exceptions, the syntax
    of the `try`-`catch`-`finally` block, using the `finally` block, when we can dispose
    of unused objects, different types of system exceptions, and creating our own
    exceptions.

    using exceptions. When application code encounters an error, it throws an exception,
    which is then caught by another block of code that collects all the information
    about the exception and pushes it to the calling method, where the `catch` block
    was provided. A dialog box will be displayed by the system if you're using a generic
    exception handler for any uncaught exceptions.

- en: Exception filters are a type of exception that's used to catch in a `catch`
    block. `System.Exception` is the base class for any exception type class. As this
    is the base class, it can hold any exception in the code. We use this when we
    have code that handles every exception or when we are throwing an exception while
    calling `method()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've already discussed that a `try` block can have multiple `catch` blocks
    with different exception filters. When the runtime evaluates the `catch` block,
    it takes a top-to-bottom approach and executes the most specific `catch` block
    that suits the exception that's been caught. If the `exception` filter in the
    `catch` block matches the exception that's been thrown or matches the base class
    of the exception that's been thrown, it's executed. As an exam tip, always remember
    to place the most specific `catch` statements on top and place the generic ones
    at the bottom.

    that handles every possible scenario and executes it without unexpected behavior
    occurring. For example, let's say your program is trying to open and write into
    a file and you receive an exception such as `File not found` or `File-in-Use`.
    Exception handling allows us to handle these scenarios. In the first case, the
    prompt asks the user to provide a correct filename, while in the second case,
    the prompt checks whether it is OK to create a new file.
