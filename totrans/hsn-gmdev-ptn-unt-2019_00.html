<div class="packt_quote">First principles, Clarice: simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius,<br/>
<br/>
"Of each particular thing, ask: What is it in itself? What is its nature?"<br/>
<br/>
~ Hannibal Lecter</div>
<p>The preceding quote from one of my favorite films sums up my approach to learning. Following over a decade working in the gaming industry, I have found that the only valid way to gain mastery over a complex system is by breaking it down into its most basic components. In other words, I try to understand the core ingredients before mastering the final form.</p>
<p>You will see that throughout this book, I'm taking a very simplistic approach in the way I present each pattern. The goal is not to dump down the subject matter, but learn by isolating the core concepts behind each design pattern so that we can observe them and learn their intricacies. I've learned this approach in the gaming industry while working as a designer and programmer. We will often build components and systems for our game in isolated levels that we call <em>gyms</em>. We would spend weeks iterating, testing, and adjusting each ingredient of our game individually until we understood how to make them work as a whole.</p>
<p>I wrote this book in a way that's consistent with how I approach game development so you, as a reader, can immerse yourself in the subject matter while taking some good habits along the way that will help you in your career.</p>
<p>Even if the code included in each chapter is not what we call <em>production-ready</em>, it still offers a good starting point to build robust systems for your game. Hence, it's important to keep in mind that the code in this book is not dogma, but learning material that is meant to be improved by you, the reader. And I hope you do so!</p>

<p><span>This book was written for beginner and experienced Unity developers. But it was also designed to be a reference for developers who are switching to Unity from other development environments and who wish to know how they can apply design patterns while using the core features of Unity's API.</span></p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>You can see by the following code example how easy it is to implement a reference to a component of a GameObject and call its </span><kbd>public</kbd><span> methods</span>."</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">public class Tomahawk : Missile<br/>{<br/>    void Awake()<br/>    {<br/>        this.seekBehavior = new SeekWithGPS();<br/>    }<br/>}</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Create two GameObjects with the <span class="packt_screen">Drone</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Sniper</span> scripts attached to them as components.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
