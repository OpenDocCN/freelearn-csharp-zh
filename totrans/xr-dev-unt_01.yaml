    to enhance our senses. Whether it’s providing additional information about the
    physical world or creating entirely new, simulated worlds for us to explore, XR
    comprises **Virtual Reality** (**VR**), **Augmented Reality** (**AR**), and **Mixed
    Reality** (**MR**) technologies. You may be someone who has already put on multiple
    **XR headsets**, lost yourself in immersive **VR games** such as *Beat Saber*,
    or even have a **VR headset** of your own. If so, you already have a pretty good
    idea of what XR is. You may know that while VR implies a complete immersion experience
    that shuts out the physical world, AR and MR combine the real and virtual worlds
    with each other. However, can you pinpoint the differences between AR and MR?

    3* headset. This headset comes equipped with cameras that allow passthrough capabilities
    – a feature enabling you to view your real-world surroundings while also being
    immersed in the virtual environment. When these cameras are active, you’re essentially
    in an MR experience. For instance, as you stand in your living room, you might
    spot an ancient vase on your coffee table. In actuality, your coffee table is
    real, but the vase is a virtual object seamlessly integrated through MR. The true
    magic of MR lies in its ability to intertwine the digital and physical worlds
    so intimately that it becomes challenging to differentiate between them. When
    the passthrough is disabled, however, the headset returns to a purely VR experience,
    detaching you from the physical world’s view.

    information onto it. When wearing **AR glasses**, such as *HoloLens* or *Magic
    Leap*, there’s a clear delineation between the real and virtual elements in your
    view. For instance, imagine wearing AR glasses and seeing interactive labels hovering
    next to objects in your room, such as a floating note reminding you to water a
    plant or arrows directing you to a misplaced item.

    through a smartphone or tablet screen. These devices provide a windowed experience
    of the augmented world – for example, games such as *Pokémon Go*, where you use
    your smartphone’s camera to spot virtual creatures in the real world, or an app
    that lets you visualize how a piece of furniture looks in your room before purchasing.

    to envision a world where real and virtual objects merge seamlessly, while VR
    creates a completely alternative reality altogether. Many find it challenging
    to differentiate between MR headsets and AR glasses, but the display serves as
    a good indicator. AR glasses utilize transparent displays instead of cameras,
    granting them direct access to real-world lighting for seamless integration of
    digital overlays. In contrast, MR headsets allow users to view the environment
    through additional sensors and cameras, but they do not provide direct access
    to sunlight. It’s like a spectrum of reality – at one end, we have the familiar
    and the real, subtly enhanced with digital elements; at the other end, we have
    entirely invented worlds, with limitless potential for exploration and adventure.
    And somewhere in between, we have the magical space where the real and virtual
    merge, seamlessly blending the best of both worlds. Can you guess which idea dates
    back the earliest – VR, AR, or MR? And how did XR enter the picture?

    was the author of *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz*, L. Frank Baum, who predicted AR
    in his 1901 novel *The Master Key: An Electrical Fairy Tale and the Optimism of
    Its Devotees*. Nevertheless, it was not until half a century had passed that the
    first aspirations of meandering through virtual realms and augmenting our reality
    truly took flight.'

    more senses than modern VR headsets. In one of the Sensorama’s experiences, you
    were teleported into a mythical jungle, and could hear the calls of tropical birds,
    smell the moist soil, and feel the mild breeze on your face as you wandered on
    a thin trail. In another experience, you rode a quad through a desert, inhaling
    the smell of hot rocks through your nose, feeling the wind hitting your cheeks
    from different angles as you made a turn, and listening to the symphony of the
    wind flowing down the dunes and the quad’s rusty motor. The Sensorama consisted
    of a stereoscopic color display, fans to simulate wind, odor emitters creating
    different smells with chemicals, a movable chair, and a stereo-sound system ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSINEBZNCks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSINEBZNCks)).

    the Sensorama’s sensory immersion, which painted a splendid vision of blended
    realities within reach, the 1990s witnessed a VR terrain strewn with the debris
    of ill-fated contraptions, such as *Sega VR* and *Nintendo Virtual Boy*. They
    failed to ignite the consumer’s imagination. As a result, the momentum of **Head-Mounted
    Displays** (**HMDs**) began to wane.

- en: This is why researchers at Indiana University invented a completely different
    XR technology called the **Computer Automatic Virtual Environment** (**CAVE**).
    This technology enables viewers standing inside a cube and wearing 3D glasses
    to see any 3D graphics projected onto the walls, ceiling, and floor as if they’re
    floating in space. Users wander through the scenes, observing the projected objects
    from any angle. CAVEs can usually host up to 10 people, all of whom might be standing
    in front of a virtual replica of Michelangelo’s David statue, viewing the masterpiece
    from any angle, plunging into the rollercoaster of evoked emotions, and capturing
    every slight edge with their eyes. As CAVEs enabled high-resolution XR experiences
    at a time when heavy HMDs with low-quality resolution were the only alternative,
    they seemed to be the most promising way to experience XR for a few years. So,
    which factors led to the widespread adoption of HMDs to experience virtual words,
    while the seemingly superior CAVEs failed to gain significant traction?

    paired with high monthly maintenance and usage costs. Setting up a CAVE can be
    tiring. You need to properly adjust the projectors, add appropriate lighting and
    air conditioning, and coordinate a network of computers to ensure the projectors
    seamlessly synchronize with one another. Most importantly, CAVEs fall short when
    it comes to multiple individual experiences or immersive storylines that demand
    interactive engagement between the users and the application: [https://sky-real.com/news/the-vr-cave-halfway-between-reality-and-virtuality/](https://sky-real.com/news/the-vr-cave-halfway-between-reality-and-virtuality/)

    CAVEs and a slew of failed HMDs, a glimmer of hope emerged in the early 2000s.
    In 2005, the world witnessed the birth of the first-ever **AR app** called *AR
    Tennis*. This game could be played by two people, armed only with a *Nokia* phone
    and a sense of adventure. Using the phone’s camera, a marker was tracked, and
    voilà – a tennis court sprang to life on the screen. Both participants could interact
    with a virtual ball, court, and opponent, all simulated within the device. The
    mobile phone itself functions as the racquet, allowing for an immersive gameplay
    experience ([https://www.imgawards.com/games/ar-tennis/](https://www.imgawards.com/games/ar-tennis/)).

    VR*, the project’s parent company, which was eventually acquired by *Facebook*
    in 2014 ([https://history-computer.com/oculus-history/](https://history-computer.com/oculus-history/)).

    practical **XR devices** are not just a novelty but also an essential tool to
    enhance our lives and make our everyday joys even more extraordinary. The year
    2022 saw the launch of the *Meta Quest Pro*, marking the first time *Meta* dipped

    high schooler with backend experience joined him. Serendipity united their game
    studio dreams. With only a father’s financial cushion and café wages, they created
    their first game in 2005 – an alien, trapped in a life-support sphere, navigating
    Earth. Players tilted the world, and the alien rolled, gathering gems and evading
    CIA capture, utilizing wall-sticking and jumping tricks. The game’s difficulty
    overshadowed its cutting-edge lighting, and it found little success. Recognizing
    their talent for building tools and prototypes, the duo refocused their energy
    on crafting a game engine for the Mac community, dubbing it Unity – a symbol of
    collaboration and compatibility ([https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/how-unity-built-the-worlds-most-popular-game-engine/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/how-unity-built-the-worlds-most-popular-game-engine/)).
