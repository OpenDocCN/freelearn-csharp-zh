You added a FSM to a game object and briefly looked at the interface elements related to Playmaker. You also manipulated game objects and components using such interface elements as the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panels, as well as the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. In this chapter we will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Component-based approach to game development that Unity relies on</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Game objects, components, and their properties in more detail</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The interchangeable nature of game objects when using components to define appearance and behavior</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Finite state machines, actions, and transitions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Making simple game mechanics using Playmaker</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Game objects, components, and properties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec16"/>Game objects, components, and properties</h1></div></div></div><p>Unity works using a popular and common approach for game development, which is called the <a id="id67" class="indexterm"/>component-based architecture. This approach is widely used in software development to make things more reusable and easier to manage.</p><p>Let us talk about the way things are organized in Unity. Some of them have already been mentioned in previous chapters, but I will repeat them briefly so that you can see the game objects, components, and their properties in the larger context.</p><p>First of all, you have a project, which is essentially a folder that contains all of the files and information about your game. Some of the files are called <a id="id68" class="indexterm"/>scenes (think of them as levels). A scene contains a number of game objects that you have added to it. The contents of your scenes are determined by you, and you can have as many of them as you want. You can also make your game switch between different scenes, thus making different sets of game objects active.</p><p>On a smaller scale, you have game objects and components. A game object<a id="id69" class="indexterm"/> by itself is simply an invisible container that does not do anything. Without adding appropriate components to it, it cannot, for instance, appear in the scene, receive input from the player, or move and interact with other objects. Using components, you can easily assemble powerful game objects while reusing several small parts, each responsible for a simple task or behavior—rendering the game object, handling the input, taking damage, playing an audio effect, and so on—making your game much simpler to develop and manage. Unity relies heavily on this approach, so the better you grasp it, the faster you will get good at it.</p><p>The only <a id="id70" class="indexterm"/>component that each and every game object in Unity has attached to it by default is <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span>. It lets you define the game object's position, rotation, and scale. Normally, you can attach, detach, and destroy components in any given game object at will, but you cannot remove <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span>.</p><p>Each component has a number of properties that you can access and change: these can be integer or floating point numbers, strings of text, textures, scripts, references to game objects or other components. They are used to change the way a certain component behaves, to influence its appearance or interaction. Some of the properties that you have already encountered in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Unity's and Playmaker's User Interface">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity's and Playmaker's</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>User Interface</em></span>, include the position, rotation, and scale properties of the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component. There are others that you have seen, including FSM, that we will talk about later in this chapter.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> game object with the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Filter</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Box Collider</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Script</strong></span> components attached to it. the properties of <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> are displayed. In order to reveal or hide a component's properties you need to left-click on its name or on the small arrow on the left of its icon.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_03_01.jpg" alt="Game objects, components, and properties"/></div><p>Unity has a number of predefined <a id="id71" class="indexterm"/>game objects that already have components attached to them, such as cameras, lights, and primitives. You can access them by choosing <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Create </strong></span>from the main menu. Alternatively, you can create empty game objects by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> in Windows) and attach components to them using the <span class="strong"><strong>Components</strong></span> submenu.</p><p>The following figure shows the project structure that we have discussed. Note that there can be any number of scenes within a single project, any number of game objects within a single scene, any number of components attached to a single game object, and finally, any number of properties within a single component.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_03_02.jpg" alt="Game objects, components, and properties"/></div><p>One final thing that you need to know about components right now is that you can copy them by right-clicking on the name of the component in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Copy Component</strong></span> from the contextual menu shown in the following screenshot. You can also reset the <a id="id72" class="indexterm"/>properties <a id="id73" class="indexterm"/>of the components to their default values, remove components, and move them up or down for your convenience.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_03_03.jpg" alt="Game objects, components, and properties"/></div><p>The <a id="id74" class="indexterm"/>copied <a id="id75" class="indexterm"/>component can be pasted by right-clicking any component's name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel and selecting either <span class="strong"><strong>Paste Component As New</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Paste Component Values</strong></span> from the same contextual menu. The difference between these two commands is that the former will add a new component identical to the one that you have copied, while the latter will simply transfer the values of all the properties. These commands become active once you have copied a component.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Working with prefabs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec17"/>Working with prefabs</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to create multiple<a id="id76" class="indexterm"/> instances of a game object with the same components and properties, or access the same game object from different scenes, you can save it as a file in your <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder. These files are called prefabs in Unity and act like game object templates. To create an empty prefab, right-click on the empty space in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, then select <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Prefab</strong></span> from the contextual menu. A new file called <code class="literal">New Prefab</code> should appear in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. Call this prefab <code class="literal">Wall</code>. Now create an empty folder called <code class="literal">Prefabs</code> and put the <code class="literal">Wall</code> prefab in this folder.</p><p>Right now the prefab is empty.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> game object that you created in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Unity's and Playmaker's User Interface">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity's and Playmaker's</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>User Interface</em></span>. Click and drag it into the <code class="literal">Wall</code> prefab in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel.</li><li class="listitem">The name of the <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> game object will become blue in <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, and when you select the <code class="literal">Wall</code> prefab, you will see all of the components that the original <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> game object had in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel.</li></ol></div><p>Now, if you drag-and-drop the <code class="literal">Wall</code> prefab into the scene, a new object called <span class="strong"><strong>Wall</strong></span> will be created with exactly the same properties as those defined in the prefab.</p><p>Moreover, if you change some of the components and/or properties in the prefab using the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel, these changes will be automatically applied to all the instances of the prefab in the scene. This can save you a lot of time if you have multiple objects of the same type (that is, walls, monsters, trees, and so on) as you do not have to select them one-by-one in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> and make the same changes multiple times.</p><p>You can also modify your prefab (and, by extension, all of its instances in the scene) by selecting one of the instances in <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, making your changes, and clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button near the top of the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. You can also undo all of the changes by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Revert</strong></span> button. This will reset the currently selected instance to the way its prefab was set up.</p><p>This works <a id="id77" class="indexterm"/>because, in fact, all the components and properties of an instance are linked to the ones of the prefab. Only when you change them in the instance they become unlinked, which means that further updates of that property on the prefab won't be applied to this instance. These unlinked properties can be distinguished because their name becomes bold in the <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> panel. If you want to re-link a specific unlinked property you can right-click on it and select <span class="strong"><strong>Revert value to Prefab</strong></span>.</p><p>Besides the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Revert</strong></span> buttons, all prefab instances also have a <span class="strong"><strong>Select</strong></span> button. This button lets you select and highlight the prefab corresponding to the currently selected instance in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, so you can access it more easily. Moreover, as we saw earlier, a prefab instance can be easily identified by its blue tinted name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel. The alternative way of creating a prefab is even simpler: you can simply drag-and-drop a game object from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel into the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel. An appropriately named file will be created in the <code class="literal">Assets</code> folder.</p><p>Another very important thing to know about prefabs is that they can be copied and shared on the Web, since they are little more than the files recognized by Unity that contain information about components and properties. Now, follow these steps to modify the <code class="literal">Wall</code> prefab to suit our needs better:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Create a new folder in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and call it <code class="literal">Materials</code>. It will contain material files that contain information about textures, shaders, and colors of your game objects.</li><li class="listitem">Create a new material file by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> button in the top-left corner of the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> from the drop-down list.</li><li class="listitem">Name the new material <code class="literal">WallMaterial</code> and put it inside the <code class="literal">Materials</code> folder.</li><li class="listitem">Select <span class="strong"><strong>WallMaterial</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel, then in <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span>, click on the rectangle next to the text that says <span class="strong"><strong>Main Color</strong></span>. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> window that appears, select the black color and close the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> window. The following screenshot shows the <span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span> modification interface as well as the <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> window:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_03_04.jpg" alt="Working with prefabs"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now that you <a id="id78" class="indexterm"/>have this new material set up, select the <code class="literal">Wall</code> prefab, then drag-and-drop <span class="strong"><strong>WallMaterial</strong></span> into the <span class="strong"><strong>Element 0</strong></span> element of the <span class="strong"><strong>Materials</strong></span> property of the prefab's <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> component. It should replace <span class="strong"><strong>Default Diffuse</strong></span>. The following screenshot shows what the <span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Renderer</strong></span> component should look like once your are done assigning the new material.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_03_05.jpg" alt="Working with prefabs"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now all of the instances of the <code class="literal">Wall</code> prefab will be black.</li><li class="listitem">Also, set the X scale property of the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component to <code class="literal">15</code>.

This way, if your game is fun, you will know about it, and if it is not, you will not get distracted by fancy visuals.</p></div></div><p>Make four <a id="id79" class="indexterm"/>walls and arrange them in the scene so that what you see in the <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> view looks like the following screenshot. If this is not the case, you can go back to the table in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Unity's and Playmaker's User Interface">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity's and Playmaker's</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>User Interface</em></span>, and see if your <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> game object is positioned and rotated correctly. Its position should be set to (<code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">10</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>) and rotation to (<code class="literal">90</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>). Don't forget that you can rotate the objects to precise values such as <code class="literal">90</code> and <code class="literal">180</code> degrees by changing their rotation angle in the <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> component. Also make sure that the Y position of all the walls remains equal to <code class="literal">0.5</code>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_03_06.jpg" alt="Working with prefabs"/></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Finite state machines, states, and actions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec18"/>Finite state machines, states, and actions</h1></div></div></div><p>We have talked about game objects and components. Now it is time to have a look at Playmaker FSMs, states, and actions in them.</p><p>An FSM<a id="id80" class="indexterm"/> in Playmaker is a graph that consists of states and transitions between them, attached to a game object. It allows for a way of visual programming using different states of the graph and events that trigger transitions to other states.</p><p>If you select the <code class="literal">Wall</code> prefab and open the <span class="strong"><strong>playMaker</strong></span> panel, you will see that its FSM has two states: the default <span class="strong"><strong>Start</strong></span> state where everything begins and another one called <span class="strong"><strong>State 1</strong></span> by default, with an arrow connecting the former to the latter. The arrow is a transition. You cannot remove the Start state or the one it is connected to, because if you could you would not need the FSM attached to the object. However, you can create new states and define transitions to them.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip12"/>Tip</h3><p>You can navigate the FSM view almost exactly the same way you would do the <span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span> view. Use the middle mouse button to drag the view. Use the left mouse button to move the states around. This does not change anything in the logic of the state machine, but lets you organize everything the way that makes sense to you, as well as look at the parts of the graph that you are most interested in at the moment if the whole state machine is too big to be shown at once.</p></div></div><p>A state<a id="id81" class="indexterm"/> in FSM is empty by default and does not do anything, a lot like an empty game object without any components attached to it. In order to make a state do something, you need to attach actions to it.</p><p>As we have seen in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Unity's and Playmaker's User Interface">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity's and Playmaker's</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>User Interface</em></span>, you can add an FSM to an object by selecting the latter, right-clicking in the FSM view of the <span class="strong"><strong>playMaker</strong></span> panel, and then selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Add FSM</strong></span> from the contextual menu. You can remove an object from the Playmaker control by right-clicking the header of the Playmaker FSM (<span class="strong"><strong>Script</strong></span>) component in <span class="strong"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Remove Component</strong></span> from the contextual menu. This will remove the FSM and erase all of the changes you made to it, including added states and transitions. An object has an FSM attached to it if there is a red Playmaker hieroglyph icon (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="graphics/8108OT_03_07.jpg" alt="Finite state machines, states, and actions"/></span>) next to its name in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel.</p><p>As an example for this book, we will be making a version of the classic air hockey game. In order to begin, we will need to add a puck and a mallet. In this chapter, you will make the mallet move based on the mouse position and push the puck as you would expect it to do in real life.</p><p>Right now in your scene there are four walls, a background quad, a camera, and a directional light (created in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Unity's and Playmaker's User Interface">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Unity's and Playmaker's User Interface</em></span>).

I realize that the last bit was a lot of actions at once, so we will discuss what exactly happens in those actions in the next chapter. This is an example of some complex logic that we will look into when we talk more about game mechanics. For now consider it an exercise to familiarize yourself with actions and variables and the way they are added and assigned in the <span class="strong"><strong>playMaker</strong></span> panel.</p><p>As another exercise, save your scene, create a few new game objects with FSMs, and try to experiment with different actions and variables, see how they are added and assigned. Don't worry if your actions do not do much. Try to familiarize yourself with the Playmaker interface and remember how to add, move, and remove actions, create new variables and events, and assign them.</p><p>Once you feel like you are comfortable with these actions, you can delete the objects you used for practice or simply reload the scene without saving it by double-clicking the <code class="literal">Scene1</code> file in the <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span> panel.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec20"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we discussed the project structure in Unity: scenes, game objects, components, and properties. We also took a closer look at the Playmaker interface: actions, events, variables, and transitions. You took the first step in creating an air hockey game by implementing a real game mechanic—a mallet that is moved with the mouse and a puck that is pushed when the mallet touches it. In the next chapter, we will add even more game mechanics, explain the ones already implemented in more detail, and try to make the game more fun and pretty.</p></div></body></html>
