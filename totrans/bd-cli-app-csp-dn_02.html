			<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Setting Up the Development Environment</h1>
			<p>Throughout this book, we‚Äôll build (and incrementally improve) a CLI application using .NET. We are going to start by setting up our development environment, which means installing the necessary tools to get started building CLI applications.</p>
			<p>To reinforce and consolidate your learning, thereby getting the most out of this book, I strongly recommend that you practice the demos I‚Äôll be showing you and complete the suggested exercises in the <em class="italic">Your turn!</em> sections at the end of each chapter. To do that, you‚Äôll need to have your development environment set up and properly configured.</p>
			<p>More specifically, in this chapter, we‚Äôre going to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Install Visual Studio Code</li>
				<li>Install the required extensions</li>
				<li>Install the .NET SDK</li>
				<li>Install and configure Git</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>The code for this book can be found at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-CLI-Applications-with-C-Sharp-and-.NET">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-CLI-Applications-with-C-Sharp-and-.NET</a>. The code for each chapter will be available in chapter-wise folders and will be mentioned in the <em class="italic">Technical requirements</em> section at the beginning of each chapter.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">There will be no code samples for this chapter, as we‚Äôll be focusing on installing the necessary tools and getting your development environment ready. Please also note that all the required tools are available to you free of charge.</p>
			<p>Throughout this book, I‚Äôll be using a Windows 11 development machine. If you‚Äôre running on Linux or macOS, there should not be any major differences, apart from the installation of the tools, which I‚Äôll highlight when needed throughout this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Installing Visual Studio Code</h1>
			<p>Even though .NET applications can be developed using various code editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), we‚Äôll be relying on Visual Studio Code.</p>
			<p>Visual Studio Code <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>is an open source, free-of-charge, cross-platform, powerful code editor from Microsoft that can be used to develop applications in numerous technologies (including .NET). Its true power comes from the wide variety of extensions, from Microsoft, third-party editors, and the community, that can be added to it to extend its capabilities and make it a code editor like no other. In my humble opinion, with all the possibilities that the extensions marketplace provides, Visual Studio Code is blurring the line that separates a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù code editor from a complete and powerful IDE.</p>
			<p>My number one reason for choosing Visual Studio Code is that, by being cross-platform, its usage is the same whether you‚Äôre running on Windows, Linux, or macOS. Hence, even though I‚Äôll be running on Windows, you‚Äôll have no problem following along with me if you‚Äôre running on a different platform, and this is a huge advantage!</p>
			<p>To download and install Visual Studio Code, the easiest<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> method is to visit the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a> website and download it from there.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_02_01.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 ‚Äì Downloading Visual Studio Code for WindowsÔªø"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 ‚Äì Downloading Visual Studio Code for Windows<a id="_idTextAnchor029"/></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">The <strong class="bold">Download for‚Ä¶</strong> link on the website should adapt to the platform you‚Äôre visiting the website from. In other words, if your computer is running Linux, the link should state <strong class="bold">Download for Linux</strong>. If not, click the drop-down symbol to the right of the download link to reveal other options.</p>
			<p>Once the download<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> is complete, head over to your downloads folder and double-click on the installer file. This will start the installation process. After you select <strong class="bold">Next</strong> and <strong class="bold">Finish</strong>, accepting the default values, you‚Äôll have Visual Studio Code installed on your development workstation!</p>
			<p>On the <strong class="bold">Select Additional Tasks</strong> screen of the installation wizard, I recommend that you check the two highlighted checkboxes in the following figure. These checkboxes will help you to open Visual Studio Code from the context of the current file/folder. I find this to be extremely useful.</p>

			<p>Our code editor is now installed and ready to be used. However, the true power of Visual Studio Code lies in its extensions. They make the development process smooth and easy, while also improving the developer‚Äôs productivity.</p>
			<p>At its essence, an extension<a id="_idIndexMarker031"/> is a software package that adds new features, functionality, or customizations to the Visual Studio Code editor.</p>
			<p>Let‚Äôs install some extensions!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Installing the required extensions</h1>
			<p>In this section, we‚Äôll install some<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> extensions that I highly recommend.</p>
			<p>Feel free to install additional extensions as well. (Drop me a line on social media to let me know which other extensions you installed and why you like them. I‚Äôm always keen to learn new things üòä.)</p>
			<p>The extensions I would recommend for this book are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">C#</strong>: This extension from Microsoft<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> is a no-brainer if you want to enable C#<a id="_idIndexMarker034"/> support in Visual Studio Code. It provides language support (including syntax highlighting and IntelliSense), debugging capabilities, and code completion.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">C# Dev Kit</strong>: This extension from Microsoft<a id="_idIndexMarker035"/> provides the Solution<a id="_idIndexMarker036"/> Explorer and Test Explorer experiences of the full-fledged Visual Studio in Visual Studio Code. If you‚Äôre migrating from Visual Studio to Visual Studio Code, or if you are still using both, this extension will provide you with a similar experience in both environments.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> AI-powered extension<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> provides whole-line completion, ranked IntelliSense suggestions, and personalized insights based on your code base.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">GitLens</strong>: This extension by GitKraken<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> supercharges your Git experience <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>within Visual Studio Code by providing features such as Git blame annotations, code navigation, and commit graph navigation. It greatly improves your Git productivity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you‚Äôre using extensions for AI assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, in Visual Studio Code, you may be presented with a warning message stating that IntelliSense will not work if the AI assistant is enabled.</p>
			<p>To add extensions<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> to your Visual Studio Code environment, use the <strong class="bold">EXTENSIONS</strong> window by clicking the corresponding icon on the left-hand side of the Visual Studio Code interface:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_02_03.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 ‚Äì The EXTENSIONS window in Visual Studio Code"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 ‚Äì The EXTENSIONS window in Visual Studio Code</p>
			<p>From there, you can search (and install) various<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> extensions. You may also notice that Visual Studio Code will suggest extensions based on the type of application you‚Äôre developing. It‚Äôs up to you whether to install them. Just keep in mind that the more extensions you install, the more computer resources Visual Studio Code will consume. So, you may want to find a balance between the extensions you install and the performance hit you‚Äôre willing to accept.</p>
			<p>Let‚Äôs install the<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> C# Dev Kit extension next.</p>
			<p>First, open the <code>C# Dev Kit</code>. Multiple results might be returned, but the one we‚Äôre looking for should be at the very top. Make sure it is the right one (C# Dev Kit, developed by Microsoft) before clicking on it to select it and reveal its product page. Finally, click on the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button below the name of the extension. The installation process should only take a few seconds.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 ‚Äì Installing the C# Dev Kit extension</p>
			<p>Once installation is complete, and a project<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> has been opened, the C# Dev Kit extension will add the <strong class="bold">SOLUTION EXPLORER</strong> capability, which is similar to our experience with Visual Studio for Windows.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_02_05.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 ‚Äì The C# Dev Kit extension in action"/>

			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Note that when you install the C# Dev Kit extension, the C# extension is automatically installed as well.</p>
			<p>Other extensions can be installed by following the exact same process.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Installing the .NET SDK</h1>
			<p>As you may have guessed, the .NET SDK<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> is required because we‚Äôll be developing CLI applications using .NET.</p>
			<p>Although any version of .NET would do, we‚Äôll use .NET 8 for the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is the latest <strong class="bold">Long Term Support</strong> (<strong class="bold">LTS</strong>) version of .NET <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>and will be supported<a id="_idIndexMarker047"/> until November 10, 2026 (<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core">https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core</a>)</li>
				<li>It is cross-platform, so the CLI applications we‚Äôll be building with .NET 8 can be executed on Windows, Linux, or macOS</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before you install the .NET 8 SDK, you can verify whether it‚Äôs already installed by using this command (works on Windows, Linux, and macOS):</p>
			<pre class="console">
$ dotnet --list-sdks</pre>			<p>This will return the list of installed .NET SDKs on your machine.</p>
			<p>The list should look like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
3.1.424 [C:\program files\dotnet\sdk]
5.0.100 [C:\program files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.402 [C:\program files\dotnet\sdk]
7.0.404 [C:\program files\dotnet\sdk]</pre>			<p>If the .NET 8 SDK is not installed on your machine (as you can see from the preceding listing, it is not installed on mine), you can download<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> it by visiting this website: <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download">https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download</a></p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_02_06.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 ‚Äì Downloading the .NET 8 SDK for Windows"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.6 ‚Äì Downloading the .NET 8 SDK for Windows</p>
			<p>Once the installer is downloaded, locate it in your downloads folder and double-click on it to start the installation process. This will require a couple of clicks, on <strong class="bold">Next</strong> and then on <strong class="bold">Finish</strong>.</p>
			<p>After the installation is complete, you will notice that not only the .NET 8 SDK has been installed but also the .NET runtime.</p>
			<p>The .NET runtime<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> is the core component that executes compiled .NET code and provides runtime services such as memory management and exception handling. The .NET SDK, on the other hand, contains tools and libraries for developing, building, testing, and debugging .NET applications.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_02_07.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 ‚Äì The .NET 8 SDK is installed"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7 ‚Äì The .NET 8 SDK is installed</p>
			<p>We can then run the previous command<a id="_idIndexMarker050"/> to list the installed .NET SDKs:</p>
			<pre class="console">
$ dotnet --list-sdks</pre>			<p>This time, you‚Äôll notice that the .NET 8 SDK is present:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
3.1.424 [C:\program files\dotnet\sdk]
5.0.100 [C:\program files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.402 [C:\program files\dotnet\sdk]
7.0.404 [C:\program files\dotnet\sdk]
8.0.204 [C:\program files\dotnet\sdk]</pre>			<p>If you‚Äôre running on a macOS computer, visiting the .NET SDK installation website will look like this:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_02_08.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 ‚Äì Downloading the .NET 8 SDK for macOS"/>

			<p>We now have everything<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> we need to develop our applications. However, if you are serious about development, you need a code management and versioning tool. This is where Git comes into play.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Installing and configuring Git</h1>
			<p>Git is a powerful and widely<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> used distributed version<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> control system that allows developers to track changes, collaborate on code, manage project history, and maintain different versions of their code base efficiently. It provides many benefits, including version tracking, branching, and collaboration, making it an essential tool for software development teams.</p>
			<p>In other words, if you‚Äôre serious about development, you need to use Git.</p>
			<p>From our perspective, since we‚Äôll be dealing with a code repository that is hosted on GitHub, we‚Äôll need to use Git (hence, having it installed on our development workstation).</p>
			<p>Git can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>
			<p>Depending on what operating system you are using, Git might already be installed. You can check that by running this command in a terminal window:</p>
			<pre class="console">
git --version</pre>			<p>If it‚Äôs already installed, you can update it by running this command:</p>
			<pre class="console">
git update</pre>			<p>Once this is done, you can skip the rest of this section.</p>
			<p>The easiest way to install<a id="_idIndexMarker054"/> Git is to visit the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a> website, where you‚Äôll get the link<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> to download Git<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> for your platform of choice.</p>
			<p>Since I‚Äôm running on a Windows machine, I‚Äôll download Git for Windows by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Download for </strong><strong class="bold">Windows</strong> link:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_02_09.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 ‚Äì Downloading Git for Windows"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.9 ‚Äì Downloading Git for Windows</p>
			<p>Next, I‚Äôll click<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> on <strong class="bold">64-bit Git for Windows Setup</strong> under <strong class="bold">Standalone Installer</strong> because I‚Äôm running<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> on an x64 machine:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_02_10.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10 ‚Äì Selecting the 64-bit version of Git for Windows"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.10 ‚Äì Selecting the 64-bit version of Git for Windows</p>
			<p>Once the download<a id="_idIndexMarker059"/> is complete, double-click on the executable file in your downloads<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> folder to start the installation process. Once again, the installation process consists of clicking on the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> and <strong class="bold">Finish</strong> buttons. You should accept mostly default values apart from two exceptions.</p>
			<p>The first exception is that I choose to select <strong class="bold">Use Visual Studio Code as Git‚Äôs default editor</strong> on the <strong class="bold">Choosing the default editor used by Git</strong> screen of the installation wizard:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_02_11.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 ‚Äì Use Visual Studio Code as Git‚Äôs default editor"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.11 ‚Äì Use Visual Studio Code as Git‚Äôs default editor</p>
			<p>The second exception is that I ask Git to override the default branch name, using <code>main</code> rather than <strong class="bold">master</strong> to use a more inclusive name.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_02_12.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 ‚Äì Override the default branch name in Git"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.12 ‚Äì Override the default branch name in Git</p>
			<p>Once the installation<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> is complete, I can validate that Git<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> is indeed installed by opening a terminal window and typing the following:</p>
			<pre class="console">
$ git</pre>			<p>When the installation process is completed successfully, you should see this output:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B22400_02_13.jpg" alt="Figure 2.13 ‚Äì Git is installed!"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.13 ‚Äì Git is installed!</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you‚Äôre running on a Linux workstation, the chances are that Git is already installed. So, before you try to install it, I recommend that you validate that it isn‚Äôt already installed by opening a terminal and simply typing <code>git</code>. If it is already installed, the output will show the help of the command.</p>
			<p>Once Git is installed, we‚Äôll perform<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> some basic configurations, particularly setting a Git<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> user identity so other developers can identify our contributions.</p>
			<p>For this, we‚Äôll use these two commands:</p>
			<pre class="console">
$ git config --global user.name "Tidjani Belmansour"
$ git config --global user.email "Tidjani.Belmansour@gmail.com"</pre>			<p>Perfect! We are now able to not only write our code but to version it and track its changes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Congratulations! You now have a development environment that is properly configured and ready to be used.</p>
			<p>As a reminder, we‚Äôve installed the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Visual Studio Code, which will serve as our code editor</li>
				<li>The C#, C# Dev Kit, IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit, and GitLens extensions for Visual Studio Code, which will make the development, debugging, and testing process smoother</li>
				<li>The .NET SDK, which is obviously required since we‚Äôll be developing a .NET CLI application</li>
				<li>Git, which is required since we‚Äôll be dealing with a GitHub repository</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we‚Äôre fully set up and ready, we can begin our journey to the wonderful land of CLI applications. Our first stopover will lead us to explore the concepts and anatomy of CLI applications.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Your turn!</h1>
			<p>Almost every chapter of this book closes with a <em class="italic">Your turn!</em> section in which you‚Äôre challenged to complete one or more tasks by applying the knowledge you gained from the chapter you just completed.</p>
			<p>Since this chapter was all about configuring your development environment, your challenge is to configure yours so you‚Äôll be able to practice what you learn in upcoming chapters. If you have already completed this task, well done! You have no more tasks to complete here, and I will see you in the next chapter.</p>
