- en: I still remember that moment of my life when I was afraid of telling my parents
    that I was going to study game development. At that time, in my region, that was
    considered a childish desire by most parents, and a career with no future, but
    I was stubborn enough not to care and to follow my dream. Today, game development
    is one of the biggest industries, generating more revenue than film.

- en: Of course, following my dream was more difficult than I thought. Anyone with
    the same dream as me sooner or later faces the fact that developing games is a
    difficult task that requires a deep level of knowledge in different areas. Sadly,
    most people give up due to this difficulty level, but I strongly believe that
    with the proper guidance and tools, you can make your career path easier. In my
    case, what helped me to flatten the learning curve was learning to use Unity.

- en: Welcome to this book about Unity 2022\. Here, you will learn how to use the
    most recent Unity features to create your first videogame in the simplest way
    possible nowadays. Unity is a tool that provides you with powerful but simple-to-use
    features to solve the most common problems in game development, such as rendering,
    animation, physics, sound, and effects. We will be using all these features to
    create a simple but complete game, learning all the nuances needed to handle Unity.

    have the contents been updated to the latest Unity and Packages versions, but
    also new content has been introduced in 2022, such as coverage of the new Input
    System.

- en: By the end of this book, you will be able to use Unity in a way that will allow
    you to start studying in depth the areas of game development that you are interested
    in to build your career or simply create hobby games just for the joy of doing
    it. Unity is a versatile tool that can be used in both professional and amateur
    projects, and is being used every day by more and more people.

- en: It is worth mentioning that Unity can be used not only for creating games but
    for any kind of interactive apps, from simple mobile apps to complex training
    or educative applications (known as **Serious Gaming**), using the latest technologies
    such as Augmented or Virtual Reality. So, even if we are creating a game here,
    you are starting a learning path that can end in lots of possible specializations.

- en: People with different backgrounds can take advantage of the whole book or parts
    of it thanks to the way it is structured. If you have basic OOP knowledge but
    have never created a game before, or have never created one in Unity, you will
    find the book a nice introduction to game development and Unity basic to advanced
    concepts. You could also find most parts of this book useful even if you are a
    seasoned Unity developer who wants to learn how to use its latest features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other side, if you don’t have any programming knowledge, you can also
    take advantage of the book, as most of the chapters don’t require programming
    experience to learn from them. Those chapters will give you a robust skillset
    to start learning coding in Unity, making the process easier than before reading
    them, and once you learn the basics of coding, you can take advantage of the scripting
    chapters of this book. Also, with the introduction of Visual Scripting, you will
    have an alternative language if you are more comfortable with node-based scripting.

- en: You will be developing a full project through the chapters of this book, and
    while you can just read the chapters, I highly recommend you practice all the
    steps in this project as you advance through the book, to get the experience needed
    to properly learn the concepts demonstrated here. The chapters are designed so
    you can customize the game and not create the exact game shown in the book. However,
    consider not deviating too much from the main idea.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The project files are split into a folder per chapter and are designed in a
    cumulative way, each folder having just the new files introduced by the chapter
    or the changed ones. This means, for example, that if a file hasn’t change since
    Chapter 1, you won’t find it in Chapter 2 onward; those chapters will just use
    the file introduced in Chapter 1\. This allows you to see just what we changed
    in each chapter, easily identifying the needed changes, and if for some reason
    you can’t finish, for example, Chapter 3, you can just continue with Chapter 4’s
    steps on top of Chapter 3\. Also note that Chapters 15 to 19 will have two versions
    of the files, the C# ones and the Visual Scripting ones.
