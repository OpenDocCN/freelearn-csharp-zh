<p class="calibre3">Everyone wants to make a game—today, this is possible more than ever due to the democratization of the game industry and the tools that are used to design and develop games. This book is written with several purposes in mind. During the process of writing this book, Unity went through several major updates and releases. At the time of writing, Unity stands at version 2018.1.1f1, and the new release has added many great features to the game engine. Simply put, it is impossible to cover everything in one single book!</p>
<p class="calibre3">This book is intended as a reference guide for individuals who want to learn about Unity and apply their skills for the creation of a <strong class="calibre5">Role-Playing Game</strong> (<strong class="calibre5">RPG</strong>).</p>
