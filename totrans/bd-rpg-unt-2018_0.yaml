- en: Everyone wants to make a game—today, this is possible more than ever due to
    the democratization of the game industry and the tools that are used to design
    and develop games. This book is written with several purposes in mind. During
    the process of writing this book, Unity went through several major updates and
    releases. At the time of writing, Unity stands at version 2018.1.1f1, and the
    new release has added many great features to the game engine. Simply put, it is
    impossible to cover everything in one single book!
