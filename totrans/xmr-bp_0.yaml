- en: Throughout my journey as a mobile developer, I have worked with many different
    development paradigms and techniques. I have built mobile applications in Java,
    objective-C, Swift (2 and 3), and C# across all mobile platforms. I’ve even built
    entire servers for my mobile applications.

- en: I'm not standing here to brag, or to say that I'm an expert. But I do believe
    that I have encountered a ton of problems, and built solutions that a lot of mobile
    developers will require.

- en: My latest work has been around building cross-platform solutions with Xamarin
    using both native and Xamarin.Forms. I have spent a lot of time narrowing down,
    what I believe are the best approaches in building any cross-platform mobile application.
    Building good architecture, structure, and a smooth user experience, whilst sharing
    as much code as possible.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1.  Building a Gallery Application"), *Building
    a Gallery Application*, provides you a walkthrough for native development with
    Xamarin by building an iOS and Android application that will read from your local
    gallery files and display them into a UITableView and ListView.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Building a SpeechTalk Application"), *Build
    a SpeechTalk Application*, provides you a walkthrough of Xamarin.Forms development
    by building an iOS, Android and Windows Phone application that will use platform
    speech services to talk text typed into a text field.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Building a GPS Locator Application"), *Building
    a GPS Locator Application*, shows you how to build a Xamarin.Forms application
    that integrates native GPS location services and Google Maps APIs. We will cover
    more content on IoC containers, the Xamarin.Forms.Maps library, and techniques
    for C# async and background tasks.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4.  Building an Audio Player Application"),
    *Building an Audio Player Application*, in this chapter, we will integrate native
    audio functions for processing a sound file using the AVFramework in iOS, and
    MediaPlayer framework in Android.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Building a Stocklist Application"), *Building
    a Stocklist Application*, in this chapter we look at detailing our XAML interfaces
    using CustomRenderers, Styles, and ControlTemplates. We also build a simple web
    service and setup a JSON feed for our mobile application.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Building a Chat Application"), *Building
    a Chat Application*, in this chapter our user interface will move away from MVVM
    design and follow a new paradigm called MVP (Model-View-Presenter). We take another
    step further into the backend and set up a SignalR hub and client to simulate
    a chat service, where data will be sent between the server and clients instantly
    as the messages become available. Another key topic of focus is the project architecture,
    spending time on separating the project into modules, and creating a nicely tiered
    structure that will maximize code sharing across different platforms.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7.  Building a File Storage Application"), *Building
    a File Storage Application*, in this chapter we walk through more development
    using Xamarin.Forms. We look at Behaviors and their use with user interfaces.
    We also build a custom layout using the Layout <View> framework and build our
    first SQLite database for storing text files.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Building a Camera Application"), *Building
    a Camera Application*, our last chapter, will introduce Effects and Triggers.
    We learn how to apply them to user interfaces and use them with Styles. We also
    build multiple complex CustomRenderers for native platform cameras, tinting images
    and receiving touch events.'
