  <div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5" class="mainHeading">Preface</h1>
    <p class="normal">I can vividly remember the trepidation I felt about telling my parents that I was going to study game development. At that time, in my region, this ambition was dismissed as juvenile and lacking in future prospects. However, my tenacity and determination led me to chase this dream relentlessly. Today, the game industry has grown exponentially, surpassing even the film industry in revenue.</p>
    <p class="normal">Of course, following my dream was more difficult than I anticipated. Anyone with the same dream as me sooner or later realizes the complexity and depth of knowledge required in this field. Sadly, this steep learning curve leads many to give up, but I strongly believe that with the proper guidance and tools, you can make your career path easier. For me, mastering Unity was pivotal in streamlining my learning process. And this book is a culmination of that experience, aimed at easing your journey into the world of game development.</p>
    <p class="normal">Welcome to this book about Unity 2023. This book will introduce you to the latest Unity features so that you can create your first video game in the simplest way possible. Unity offers an array of user-friendly yet powerful tools to address common game development challenges, such as rendering, animation, physics, sound, and effects. We will utilize all these features to create a simple but complete game, delving into all the intricacies of Unity.</p>
    <p class="normal">By the end of this book, you will have all the skills necessary to use Unity effectively, allowing you to explore in depth various areas of game development that interest you, whether for building a professional career or simply for the joy of creating games as a hobby. Unity is a versatile tool for both professional and amateur projects, and it is being used every day by more and more people.</p>
    <p class="normal">Unity’s utility extends beyond game creation; it’s a powerful platform for all kinds of interactive applications, from straightforward mobile apps to complex educational and training programs, often referred to as Serious Gaming. These applications harness cutting-edge technologies like Augmented and Virtual Reality. Therefore, while our primary focus here is game development, you are embarking on a learning journey that offers a spectrum of potential specializations.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-6" class="heading-1">Who this book is for</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book has been thoughtfully structured to cater to people from various backgrounds. If you have a basic understanding of <strong class="keyWord">Object-Oriented Programming</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">OOP</strong>) but are new to game development or have never used Unity, you’ll find this book a good introduction to both game development and Unity’s fundamental to advanced concepts. Even seasoned Unity developers looking to master the platform’s latest features will discover valuable insights in many sections of this book.</p>
    <p class="normal">On the other hand, if you’re starting without any programming experience, this book is still highly accessible. Many chapters have been designed to be informative without requiring prior coding knowledge. These sections will equip you with a solid foundation for starting to learn how to code in Unity, making the learning curve much smoother than it would be otherwise. Once you’ve grasped the basics of coding, the scripting-focused chapters of this book will become increasingly beneficial. Additionally, with the introduction of Visual Scripting in Unity, those who prefer node-based scripting have an appealing alternative available.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="heading-1">What this book covers</h1>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Embark on Your Unity Journey</em>, teaches you how to install and set up Unity on your computer, as well as how to create your first project.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Crafting Scenes and Game Elements</em>, teaches you the concepts of Scenes and GameObjects, the Unity way to describe what your game world is composed of.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">From Blueprint to Reality: Building with Terrain and ProBuilder</em>, is where we will be creating our first level layout, prototyping it with the Terrain and ProBuilder Unity features.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Seamless Integration: Importing and Integrating Assets</em>, is where we will be creating our first level layout, prototyping it with the Terrain and ProBuilder Unity features.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Unleashing the Power of C# and Visual Scripting</em>, is the first programming chapter of the book. We will learn how to create our first script using C# in the Unity way, and then we will explore how to do the same with Visual Scripting, the new node-based coding language of Unity.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Dynamic Motion: Implementing Movement and Spawning</em>, teaches you how to program the movement of your objects and how to spawn them. This chapter introduces the new Unity Input System. General programming knowledge is assumed from this point on.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Collisions and Health: Detecting Collisions Accurately</em>, teaches you how to configure the Physics settings of objects to detect when two of them collide and react to the collision, creating a health system, in this case.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Victory or Defeat: Win and Lose Conditions</em>, covers how to detect when the game should end, both when the player wins and loses.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Starting your AI Journey: Building Intelligent Enemies for Your Game</em>, covers creating a basic AI using several Unity features for creating challenging enemies in our game.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Material Alchemy: Using URP and Shader Graph for Stunning Visuals</em>, shows how to use one of the latest Unity render systems (Universal Render Pipeline, or URP) and how to create effects with the Shader Graph feature.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Captivating Visual Effects: Harnessing Particle Systems and Visual Effect Graph</em>, teaches you how to create visual effects such as water and fire using the two main Unity tools for doing so, Particle Systems and VFX Graph, and how to make scripts that control them according to what’s happening in the game.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Enlightening Worlds: Illuminating Scenes with the Universal Render Pipeline</em>, looks at lighting, which is a concept big enough to have its own chapter. Here, we will deepen our knowledge of the Universal Render Pipeline, specifically its lighting capabilities.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">Immersive Realism: Achieving Fullscreen Effects with Post-Processing</em>, teaches you how to add a layer of effects on top of your scene graphics using the postprocessing feature of the Universal Render Pipeline to get that film effect most modern games have today.</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-8" class="heading-1">To get the most out of this book</h1>
    <p class="normal">You will be developing a full project through the chapters of this book, and while you can just read the chapters, I highly recommend you practice all the steps in this project as you advance through the book so you can get the experience needed to properly learn the concepts demonstrated here. The chapters have been designed so you can customize the game and not create the exact game shown in the book. However, I recommend not deviating too much from the main idea.</p>
    <p class="normal">The project files have been split into a folder per chapter and have been designed in a cumulative way, each folder having just the new files introduced by the chapter or the changed ones. This means, for example, that if a file hasn’t changed since <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, you won’t find it in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em> onward; those chapters will just use the file introduced in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>. This allows you to see just what we changed in each chapter, easily identifying the needed changes, and if for some reason you can’t finish, for example, <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, you can just continue with <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>’s steps on top of <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>. Also note that <em class="chapterRef">Chapters 15</em> to <em class="chapterRef">19</em> will have two versions of the files: the C# ones and the Visual Scripting ones.</p>
