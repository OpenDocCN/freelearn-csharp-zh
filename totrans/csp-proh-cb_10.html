It doesn't matter whether you are a hobbyist or professional programmer; when you get up from your desk to go home you better be sure your code is safe. In this chapter, we will be looking at choosing and using a source control strategy. Some of the topics we will be taking a look at are:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up Visual Studio account management and determining which source control solution is best for you</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up Visual Studio GitHub integration, checking in code for the first time, and checking in changes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Working as a team using GitHub, and handling and resolving conflicts in code</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec74"/>Introduction</h1></div></div></div><p>During my career, I have used Visual SourceSafe, SVN, VSTS, Bitbucket, and GitHub. It really does not matter how you approach it, the important thing is that you keep your source code safe and versioned.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec75"/>Setting up Visual Studio account management and determining which source control solution is best for you</h1></div></div></div><p>Visual Studio allows developers to <a class="indexterm" id="id702"/>create an account and sign in. This is particularly beneficial if you hot desk often or work in multiple locations<a class="indexterm" id="id703"/> on different machines (think work and home PCs), because Visual Studio will then automatically sync your settings between the machines you're signed in to.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec179"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>This recipe will assume that you have just completed installing Visual Studio 2015 on your machine.

I find it <a class="indexterm" id="id706"/>useful to just use my Outlook e-mail <a class="indexterm" id="id707"/>address. In my opinion, it is one of the best web e-mails available.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note37"/>Note</h3><p>Please note, I'm not endorsing Outlook for any reason other than I really think it is a great product. I also have a Gmail account as well as an iCloud e-mail account.</p></div></div><div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_29.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">After adding <a class="indexterm" id="id708"/>your e-mail account, Visual Studio <a class="indexterm" id="id709"/>will redirect you to a sign-in page:<div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_30.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Because I already<a class="indexterm" id="id710"/> have an Outlook account, Visual <a class="indexterm" id="id711"/>Studio simply allows me to sign in with it. If you don't have an account, you can create one here:<div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_31.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Visual Studio will <a class="indexterm" id="id712"/>now ask you to enter some <a class="indexterm" id="id713"/>additional information. One part to note is that you can already link your Team Services account here if you have one. For now, leave it blank, as this will be dealt with in a later recipe:<div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_32.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">After your <a class="indexterm" id="id714"/>account is created, you can see that <a class="indexterm" id="id715"/>you have been signed in by looking at the account selected in the right-hand corner of the Visual Studio IDE:<div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_33.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Clicking on the down <a class="indexterm" id="id716"/>arrow next to your<a class="indexterm" id="id717"/> account name, you can view your <strong>Account settings…</strong><div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_34.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">This will show you a summary of your account, from where you can further personalize your account:<div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_35.jpg"/></div></li></ol></div><p>The choice of source <a class="indexterm" id="id718"/>control is a topic every developer has a strong opinion about. Unfortunately, if you work for a boss, that decision might not even be up to you. Many companies have already set up their source control system just the way they like it, and you will need to fall in with company procedure. That is just the way it is. It is however good to know about the options available to you as an indie developer.</p><p>All good developers should<a class="indexterm" id="id719"/> be writing code on their own time too. You are not only a developer while you sit at work. We eat, breathe, sleep, and live code. It is part of who and what we are. I will say that in order for you to become better at your job as a developer, you must play with code on your own time. Start a pet project, get some friends together, and decide to write some software together. Not only will this make you all better at what you do, but you will learn a lot from each other.</p><p>If you are a remote developer that does not commute to, and work in, an office every day, you can still connect with the developer community. There are so many resources available to developers, and the developer community is more than happy to rally around newbies and help them grow. Starting a solo or pet project is useless if you don't commit (pun intended) to keeping your code safe. To do this, you don't have to pay a single dollar either. Visual Studio Online (now called Team Services) and GitHub both provide developers with a fantastic platform to keep your code safe.</p><p>Let us start by looking at Team<a class="indexterm" id="id720"/> Services. The site can be found by pointing your browser to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs">https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs</a>.</p><p>Here you will see that Microsoft has given developers a fantastic opportunity to use Team Services. It is absolutely <a class="indexterm" id="id721"/>free for up to five users. This means that <a class="indexterm" id="id722"/>you and your mates can collaboratively work on the next big thing while ensuring that your code remains secure. Signing up is as simple as clicking on the <strong>Get started for free</strong> link:</p><div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_36.jpg"/></div><p>The second excellent option is GitHub. It differs slightly in its free offering by requiring developers to using a public repository on the free account. If you don't mind your code being essentially open source, then GitHub is a great choice. With GitHub though, you can have unlimited collaborators<a class="indexterm" id="id723"/> and public repositories:</p><div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_24.jpg"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec181"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>The choice of source control<a class="indexterm" id="id724"/> essentially comes down to the openness of your code. If you can afford to let other developers see and download your code, then GitHub is a great choice. If you need your code to remain private and only shared between specific people, then a paid GitHub account will be better suited. If you don't want to fork out money yet, then Team Services will be your best bet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec76"/>Setting up Visual Studio GitHub integration, checking in code for the first time, and checking in changes</h1></div></div></div><p>GitHub has been a tour de force for so many years. There are developers that swear by it. In fact, it is the default<a class="indexterm" id="id725"/> option when using Apple's Xcode IDE. For <a class="indexterm" id="id726"/>whatever reason you decide to use GitHub, rest assured that <a class="indexterm" id="id727"/>you and your code are in good hands.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec182"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>The following recipe will assume that<a class="indexterm" id="id728"/> you have already signed up for GitHub and that you have enabled <strong>Two-factor authentication</strong>. If you have not signed up for a GitHub account, you can do so by going to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.github.com">www.github.com</a> and creating a new account. To enable <strong>Two-factor authentication</strong> on your GitHub account (something I personally strongly advise), do the following:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on the down arrow next to your profile image, and select <strong>Settings</strong>:<div><img alt="Getting ready" src="img/B05391_10_22.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">From the <strong>Personal settings</strong> menu that appears on the left of the next web page, select <strong>Security</strong>:<div><img alt="Getting ready" src="img/B05391_10_23.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">The first section on the<a class="indexterm" id="id729"/> security page will be<a class="indexterm" id="id730"/> your <strong>Two-factor authentication</strong> status.

Using an app is by far the easiest, and if you<a class="indexterm" id="id732"/> have a smartphone or tablet you can download an authenticator application from the applicable app store. From there on, follow the prompts that GitHub gives you to complete the <strong>Two-factor authentication</strong> setup:<div><img alt="Getting ready" src="img/B05391_10_26.jpg"/></div></li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec183"/>How to do it...</h2></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">If you are<a class="indexterm" id="id733"/> installing Visual Studio 2015 for the first time, have a look at the <strong>Custom</strong> installation option.

In other words, the change will not be reflected in the remote<a class="indexterm" id="id786"/> repository. The <strong>Commit All and Push</strong> button will record the changes on your local machine and push those changes to your remote GitHub repository. The <strong>Commit All and Sync</strong> button will record the changes on your local machine, then it will pull any changes from the remote repository, and finally it will do<a class="indexterm" id="id787"/> the push. You will want to do this if you are working in a team. For this recipe, however, I will just do a <strong>Commit All and Push</strong>, seeing as I am the only developer working on this repo:<div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_19.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">When the commit has <a class="indexterm" id="id788"/>completed, the <strong>Team Explorer</strong> window<a class="indexterm" id="id789"/> will notify you of the successful commit:<div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_20.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Heading over to<a class="indexterm" id="id790"/> GitHub online, you will see the newly <a class="indexterm" id="id791"/>pushed changes reflected in your GitHub repository, along with the commit message:<div><img alt="How to do it..." src="img/B05391_10_21.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">GitHub is a fantastic source control solution for any developer. Consider creating an open source project. It is more beneficial than you might imagine.</li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec184"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>The free GitHub account allows<a class="indexterm" id="id792"/> you to create public repositories. This means that anyone is able to search for, view, and clone your project from GitHub to their own desktop. This is the central idea behind GitHub. This is obviously a key factor <a class="indexterm" id="id793"/>for indie developers and corporates that don't want to spend money. Corporates can afford it more though than an indie developer, but I think that some companies prefer to roll their own than use a service provider hosted in the cloud somewhere. This means that they prefer to keep the source control under their control by setting up a source control system on their own corporate servers. Having GitHub as an option for indie developers is an awesome solution. For those that require private repos, the fee isn't a stumbling block either.</p></div></div>
