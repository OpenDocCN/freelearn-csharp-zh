			<p>This section contains answers to questions from all the chapters.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Chapter 1 – Text, Flow, Choices, and Weaves</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>The story is the content, and the narrative is the experience of it. In nonlinear storytelling, the story is potentially experienced in a different order, with each reordering creating a new narrative for the reader.</li>
				<li>ink understands flow as movement through the story as a narrative-like experience. In ink, this can "<em class="italic">run out</em>" when there are no paths to the end of the story.</li>
				<li>Multiple lines can be combined using glue, a combination of less-than and greater-than symbols.</li>
				<li>A weave is a collection of choices.</li>
				<li>The different types of choices are basic, often called disappearing, and sticky choices. The first can only be used once and the second multiple times, as they "stick around" across weave usages.</li>
				<li>Selective output allows an author to <em class="italic">select</em> what to use when shaping an option based on the text of the choice in ink. Different amounts of text can be shown to the reader based on the use of opening and closing square brackets with the text of the choice.</li>
				<li>Sticky choices keep options open for later use. In more complex stories, the reader may return to a weave and pick a different or the same option again.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Chapter 2 – Knots, Diverts, and Looping Patterns</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">A knot is a section of a story with a name that can be diverted to ink.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">DONE</strong> ends the current flow and <strong class="source-inline">END</strong> stops the story completely.</li>
				<li>A stitch is a sub-section of a story that can only appear inside a knot. </li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">INCLUDE</strong> keyword pulls in other files and allows a project to use multiple files with their own knots and stitches available to the whole project.</li>
				<li>A labeled option creates a value that is increased each time it is shown. Conditional values, on the other hand, allow for comparing variables and values. If the condition is true when used with an option, it will be shown. Otherwise, it will be hidden.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Chapter 3 – Sequences, Cycles, and Shuffling Text</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The three types of alternatives are sequences, cycles, and shuffles.</li>
				<li>The single-line forms of sequences, cycles, and shuffles all use the vertical bar, <strong class="source-inline">|</strong>, between elements.</li>
				<li>The ampersand, <strong class="source-inline">&amp;</strong>, is used before the first element as an alternative to creating a cycle.</li>
				<li>A sequence will show each of the elements until the last. A cycle will loop back to the first element after its last one.</li>
				<li>A shuffle picks a random element from its set each time it is run.</li>
				<li>Multi-line sequences use the <strong class="source-inline">stopping</strong> keyword. This is unlike cycles and shuffles, which each use the name of the type of alternative as the keyword to create their multi-line forms.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Chapter 4 – Variables, Lists, and Functions</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Assignment happens any time a variable is given a new value. This happens when a variable is first created in ink and can also happen on single lines of code.</li>
				<li>A new string created based on two strings being added, or between a string and numerical value, is known as concatenation.</li>
				<li>The tilde defines a single line of code in ink. It is often used with assignment, to call a function, or to perform some other single-line action.</li>
				<li>The values in a list are part of a Boolean set. This means they are either <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>. In ink, all values in a list are set to <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> by default. To change to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, they must be surrounded by opening and closing parentheses.</li>
				<li>The technical term for a variable defined as part of a function or a knot is a parameter. It affects the calculations or how content is processed by the function.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Chapter 5 – Tunnels and Threads</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">To create a tunnel, a divert must be used before and after the name of a knot or stitch. Within the knot or stitch, two diverts must be used together to return from the tunnel.</li>
				<li>Tunnels connect two different locations in ink. They can be used between knots, stitches, or other locations in a story. Tunnels move the flow to a location and then return when two diverts are encountered.</li>
				<li>A divert moves the flow to another knot or stitch. A tunnel uses two diverts to move to a knot or stitch and then returns to where it started. A thread is the inverse of a divert. It moves the knot or stitch to the current flow location instead of moving the flow to the knot or stitch.</li>
				<li>Normally, multiple threads cannot be used on the same line. However, when using alternatives, it is possible to include multiple threads as part of the same structure. They are still accessed one at a time but can be grouped together on one line.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Chapter 6 – Adding and Working with the ink-Unity Integration Plugin</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">No, Inkle, the maintainers of the ink-Unity Integration plugin, do not recommend using the version found in the Unity Asset Store. This version is often out of date.</li>
				<li>When the ink-Unity Integration plugin is installed in a project, new ink files can be created using the Create menu. This can be accessed using the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window toolbar, right-clicking in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window, or via the <strong class="bold">Assets</strong> menu by selecting <strong class="bold">Create</strong>.</li>
				<li>Inky is a good choice for editing ink source files. However, it needs to be associated with ink source files, which can be opened by double-clicking on files in the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window.</li>
				<li>Yes, the auto-compilation process can be adjusted by opening the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> Settings, selecting <strong class="bold">Ink</strong>, and then changing the <strong class="bold">Compile All Ink Automatically</strong> option.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Chapter 7 – Unity API – Making Choices and Story Progression</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The <strong class="source-inline">Continue()</strong> method only loads a single line of ink text content and the next weave it encounters each time it is called. The <strong class="source-inline">ContinueMaximally()</strong> method loads all text content until it encounters a weave or the end of the story.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">ChooseChoiceIndex()</strong> method expects an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> value within the range of the total number of entries in the <strong class="source-inline">currentChoices</strong> property in the <strong class="source-inline">Story</strong> class.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">canContinue</strong> property is a Boolean value. If there is more story content, it will be <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>. Otherwise, it will be <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">canContinue</strong> property should always be checked as part of a conditional statement before using the <strong class="source-inline">Continue()</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">ContinueMaximally()</strong> methods to prevent either method from throwing an error.</li>
				<li>A prefab is a <strong class="source-inline">GameObject</strong> instance saved as an asset in Unity. Any game object used as part of the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> view can be saved as an asset by dragging it into the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window. A copy of a prefab can be created during runtime through a process called <em class="italic">instantiation</em> in Unity.</li>
				<li>For a weave encountered in a running ink story, the <strong class="source-inline">currentChoices</strong> properties will contain a <strong class="source-inline">List&lt;Choice&gt;</strong> instance, where each entry is an object based on the <strong class="source-inline">Choice</strong> class with <strong class="source-inline">text</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">index</strong> properties.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>Chapter 8 – Story API – Accessing ink Variables and Functions</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Yes, once a variable is created in ink, it can be accessed at any point in the story. By using the <strong class="source-inline">variablesState</strong> property as part of the Story API, the values of variables can also be accessed and changed.</li>
				<li>Because functions are global in ink, this means they can be accessed from any point in an ink story. When working with the ink-Unity Integration plugin, the <strong class="source-inline">HasFunction()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">EvaluateFunction()</strong> methods as part of the Story API provide the ability to test for a global function in an ink story and evaluate it, if it exists. The <strong class="source-inline">EvaluateFunction()</strong> method calls the ink function and can be used to pass data to ink or retrieve the text output of the function using the <strong class="source-inline">out</strong> C# keyword.</li>
				<li>Unlike text content, the values of variables in ink exist outside of story progression controlled by the <strong class="source-inline">Continue()</strong> method or <strong class="source-inline">ContinueMaximally()</strong> method. However, because variables are global, their values can be changed during the action of loading a line or a larger chunk of a story. The value of a variable might be changed because of using either the <strong class="source-inline">Continue()</strong> method or <strong class="source-inline">ContinueMaximally()</strong> method, but they are not technically needed to work with variables in ink.</li>
				<li>Any variables can be accessed by using their name in quotation marks within square brackets when working with the <strong class="source-inline">variablesState</strong> property as part of the Story API. While the same API provides methods for working with variables in ink, the shorthand syntax is often the preferred way to access and change the values of variables.</li>
				<li>Yes. It is recommended to use the <strong class="source-inline">HasFunction()</strong> method for functions before attempting to change the value of a variable or evaluate a function. This will help prevent potentially game-crashing problems.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">out</strong> C# keyword provides a way to pass a variable by reference instead of passing only its value. This is an easy way to retrieve the text output of an ink function as a parameter to the <strong class="source-inline">EvaluateFunction()</strong> method of the Story API.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Chapter 9 – Story API – Observing and Reacting to Story Events</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The <strong class="source-inline">ObserveVariable()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">ObserveVariables()</strong> methods are based on the use of the action of <em class="italic">observing</em> variables. This separates the reaction in Unity from the action in ink. The action of observing allows Unity to react in any way it wants. The methods only provide the name of the variable and its new value.</li>
				<li>Delegated functions are the second parameter of both the <strong class="source-inline">ObserveVariable()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">ObserveVariables()</strong> methods. The use of the <strong class="source-inline">delegate</strong> C# keyword <em class="italic">delegates</em> the running of a function because of another function or method. The <strong class="source-inline">ObserveVariable()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">ObserveVariables()</strong> methods are used in a callback approach.</li>
				<li>The first, the <strong class="source-inline">ObserveVariable()</strong> method, accepts the name of a single variable and a delegated function to be called when it changes. The second, the <strong class="source-inline">ObserveVariables()</strong> method, accepts a <strong class="source-inline">List&lt;string&gt;</strong> instance of variables to watch and a delegated function. In both cases, the delegated function will be called with the name of the variable that changed and its new value.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">variablesState</strong> property provides direct access to ink variables and their current values by their names. However, the name of the ink variable must be used to access its value as part of recurring code such as might be found in the <strong class="source-inline">Update()</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">FixedUpdate()</strong> methods in Unity. The <strong class="source-inline">ObserveVariable()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">ObserveVariables()</strong> methods allow a developer to write code that only runs when one or more ink variables change and only then. This can free up time each cycle to only run the necessary code and then update Unity when ink itself updates some value.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>Chapter 10 – Dialogue Systems with ink</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">A hashtag is created when the hash (<strong class="source-inline">#</strong>) is used to create a tag on a single line in ink. Hashtags are used to add extra data per line.</li>
				<li>A hashtag can only be used at the end of a line, but a speech tag is often used at the beginning of a line. A speech tag is always used to mark who is communicating, but a hashtag conveys extra information of any form.</li>
				<li>The branching patterns of dialogue often look like trees, where the initial set of choices appears as a "<em class="italic">trunk</em>," with each branch moving outward into its own sets.</li>
				<li>The list pattern presents options in a vertical arrangement. It can display multiple sentences per option but often needs scroll bars to present all the options within a set. It is best used when there is more visual spacing available for dialogue choices.</li>
				<li>The radial menu pattern presents options clockwise on the screen. It is often used with video game consoles or other limited visual space contexts. Because of the reduced amount of spacing, options often appear as single words, icons, or short descriptions of their outcomes.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>Chapter 11 – Quest Tracking and Branching Narratives </h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">A quest is a series of events connected to a character within a story.</li>
				<li>The name of the ink knot used to progress a quest is <strong class="source-inline">progress</strong>.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">ChoosePathString()</strong> method abruptly moves the current location from one section to another.</li>
				<li>The global property in Unity is named <strong class="source-inline">Application.dataPath</strong>.</li>
				<li>Polling requires checking values in one system from another. The events-based approach allows one system to observe another and respond to changes (events) as they happen.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor200"/>Chapter 12 – Procedural Storytelling with ink</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Procedural storytelling</strong> occurs when the story of a project is generated by procedures, or rules, that dynamically plan or shape content for a player.</li>
				<li>A <strong class="bold">random table</strong> is a set of entries where individual values are chosen at random. Originally created as tables where rows were chosen using dice, the same concept can be used in ink with shuffles.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Randomness</strong> can be weighted toward certain probabilities. In ink, the <strong class="source-inline">RANDOM()</strong> function can be used to decide the probability of entries instead of the default equal amounts when using the shuffle functionality.</li>
				<li>A <strong class="bold">grammar</strong> is a set of rules for a language. A substitution grammar decides the substitution of words or phrases according to a set of rules. Often, substitution grammars are used with random entries or according to conditional rules.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Story planning</strong> is the ordering of story content based on rules. Story planning is based on using a substitution grammar for deciding which parts of a project a player might experience, either before play starts or because of certain player actions.</li>
