<p class="mce-root">Part one of the book will start by exploring the various network architectures that make distributed programming possible in the first place. It will examine the standards adhered to by hardware and software vendors to allow communication across networks, including the DNS naming system, IPv4 and IPv6 standards for device addressing, and local hardware-level APIs and data structures that allow users to program for those networks, with basic examples of C# software that leverage or demonstrate these concepts.</p>
