- en: Until now, creating interactive web pages meant using JavaScript. But with Blazor,
    a framework for creating .NET web applications, developers can easily build interactive
    and rich web applications using C#. This book will guide you through the most
    commonly encountered scenarios when starting your journey with Blazor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, you’ll discover how to leverage the power of Blazor and learn what
    you can do with **server-side rendering** (**SSR**), Blazor Server, Blazor WebAssembly,
    and Blazor Hybrid. This book will help you overcome some of the common obstacles
    that developers face by showing you how all of the elements work together practically.
    As you advance, you’ll learn how to create Blazor projects, how Razor syntax works,
    how to validate forms, and how to create your own components. The book then introduces
    you to the key concepts involved in web development with Blazor, which you can
    put into practice immediately.

    and Blazor WebAssembly and the new Static and Streaming SSR. You will get an overview
    of how the technology works and a brief history of where Blazor comes from. Knowing
    the structure and differences between the hosting models is essential for understanding
    the technology.'

    the basic concepts of Blazor in general. The project we are creating is adapted
    for real-world use but some parts are left out, such as proper error handing.
    You should, however, get a good grasp of the building blocks of Blazor.
