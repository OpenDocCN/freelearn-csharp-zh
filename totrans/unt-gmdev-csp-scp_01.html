			<p>Before starting, I wanted to discuss mistakes. It’s something we all do, or, as John Powell said, <em class="italic">The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing</em> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/118431-the-only-real-mistake-is-the-one-from-which-we">https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/118431-the-only-real-mistake-is-the-one-from-which-we</a>). Every effort is being made to ensure that this book is as accurate as possible. The topics will be reviewed by a team after I submit this draft. I’ll receive feedback, and any errors will <span class="No-Break">be corrected.</span></p>
			<p>As a learner, you too will experience mistakes. This is expected, and, as John Powell emphasized, we need to learn from them. Try not to get discouraged. This is such an exciting topic at a time when opportunities are appearing in every industry using what I cover in <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>

This guide aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Unity’s essential tools and interfaces, equipping you with the knowledge and confidence to embark on your game <span class="No-Break">development projects.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Unity <span class="No-Break">interface overview</span></li>
				<li>Exploring the <span class="No-Break">Unity Editor</span></li>
				<li>Creating a <span class="No-Break">C# script</span></li>
				<li>Basic concepts <span class="No-Break">of C#</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>For this book, we’ll make use of three main pieces of software: Unity Hub, Unity Editor, and an <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>). An IDE is basically a very smart text editor. When configured for Unity and C#, it will check your coding for errors and highlight those <span class="No-Break">for you.</span></p>
			<p>The Unity Hub is available from Unity’s website. Unity will require that you create an account. For most beginners, select the Free plan. The Unity Hub download is located <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://unity.com/download"><span class="No-Break">https://unity.com/download</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The Unity Editor is most conveniently installed through the Unity Hub. That process is described in this chapter. Though it is possible to download the Editor directly from Unity’s website, it is not recommended. The Editor must be installed in a location that the Unity <span class="No-Break">Hub searches.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, you need an IDE. A popular choice is Microsoft Visual Studio. When you install an Editor through the Unity Hub, Visual Studio is an available option. You can download Visual Studio directly <span class="No-Break">from </span><a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/"><span class="No-Break">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>There are other IDEs available for use with Unity. A popular choice is JetBrains’ Rider. It offers a free trial; after that, Rider is a paid service. It can be found <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Understanding LTS and naming conventions</h2>
			<p>LTS versions of Unity are stable releases that are supported and maintained by Unity Technologies for a longer period, typically two years. They receive regular updates to fix bugs and improve performance <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>but don’t include <span class="No-Break">new features.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s move on to the naming conventions. Unity names its editors based on the year and version – for example, <span class="No-Break">Unity 2020.1.</span></p>
			<p>As of my last update, Unity had two <span class="No-Break">release streams:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">TECH stream</strong>: These are the latest <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>versions with new features and improvements. They are named based on the year and incremental updates (e.g., <span class="No-Break">Unity 2023.1).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">LTS stream</strong>: These versions<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> follow the TECH stream but are focused on stability and extended support. They are named similarly but with <strong class="bold">LTS</strong> at the end (e.g., Unity <span class="No-Break">2020.3 LTS).</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Starting in 2024, Unity will once again change its naming conventions. Unity 6 will be introduced. Along with its version name change, Unity’s pricing plan will also change. The vast majority of Unity developers will not be affected by <span class="No-Break">these charges.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s end this section with some of my own suggestions regarding the <span class="No-Break">installation process:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Always check the Unity website for the latest system requirements and versions, as they are subject to change with <span class="No-Break">new updates.</span></li>
				<li>For specific development needs (such as VR or AR), additional setup and components may be required (see <a href="B22128_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor324"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
				<li>Ensure that your system’s graphics drivers are up to date for the best performance <span class="No-Break">with Unity.</span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Basic concepts of C#</h1>
			<p>Welcome to our in-depth exploration of programming fundamentals within Unity3D, focusing on leveraging C# for game development. This section introduces the core concepts and structures of C#, starting with data types <span class="No-Break">and variables.</span></p>
			<p>As we progress, we’ll dive into control structures, functions, and methods, uncovering how to control the flow<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> of your game, execute code blocks, and encapsulate functionality for reuse and clarity. Understanding these elements is crucial for scripting <span class="No-Break">game logic.</span></p>
			<p>This section aims to briefly explore C#, familiarizing you with basic programming elements. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to enhance your C# prowess in Unity3D, this journey will equip you with the skills necessary for advanced game development. Let’s embark on this transformative path, where your creative ideas become tangible realities in the world <span class="No-Break">of gaming.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Utilizing C# data types for creative game development</h2>
			<p>In C#, data types such as<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> variables store information<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> that is used in games. For example, we could use an integer, a variable that only contains whole numbers, to record how many lives a player <span class="No-Break">has remaining.</span></p>
			<h3>Understanding variables</h3>
			<p>In C#, variables are essential elements<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> that act as storage locations in the computer’s memory, holding data that can be modified during program execution. They are fundamental in defining the behavior and state of a program, playing a crucial role in C# programming, especially in Unity for game development. Variables are characterized by their type, which determines the kind of data they can hold and the operations that can be performed <span class="No-Break">on them.</span></p>
			<p>The most common variable types in C# include <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> for integers, <strong class="source-inline">float</strong> for floating-point numbers, <strong class="source-inline">double</strong> for double-precision floating-point numbers, <strong class="source-inline">bool</strong> for Boolean values, <strong class="source-inline">char</strong> for characters, and <strong class="source-inline">string</strong> for sequences of characters. Additionally, C# supports more complex types such as arrays and objects, enabling developers to handle more sophisticated data structures. Each of these variable types serves a distinct purpose, such as controlling loop iterations with integers, managing spatial coordinates with floats, or handling textual data with strings, thus providing a versatile toolkit for a wide array of programming tasks in <span class="No-Break">game development.</span></p>
			<p>The following is a generic sample C# script that uses the variable types just described. You can see the structure for initializing or declaring a variable. It starts with the variable type, such as <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>. That is followed by the variable’s name, such as <strong class="source-inline">playerScore</strong>. Then, an equal sign (<strong class="source-inline">=</strong>) is used to assign the value to the variable. Further in the script, the value of each variable is <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>added to the game project log, which is viewable in the Editor’s <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Console</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> window:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
using UnityEngine;
public class VariablesExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    private int _playerScore;
    private float _playerSpeed
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {

}</pre>			<p>The provided script <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>demonstrates a basic C# script in Unity, starting with <strong class="source-inline">using UnityEngine;</strong> to import essential Unity Engine utilities. It introduces a public class named <strong class="source-inline">VariablesExample</strong>, adhering to Unity’s convention where the class and filename should match, and inherits from <strong class="source-inline">MonoBehaviour</strong>, a key Unity class enabling Unity-specific functions such as <strong class="source-inline">Start()</strong>, which runs on initialization. Variables are declared with their type, such as <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> for integers, followed by a camel case named <strong class="source-inline">identifier</strong> and an optional initial value, with strings enclosed in quotes. This setup lays the groundwork for utilizing Unity’s features and writing <span class="No-Break">game logic.</span></p>
			<p>The preceding script also demonstrates the concept of global and local variables. Both <strong class="source-inline">_playerScore</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">_playerSpeed</strong> are instance variables, declared outside of any method or function, within the class but typically referred to as fields in C#. The use of <strong class="source-inline">private</strong> means other scripts cannot access these variables directly. To share a variable, you would use <strong class="source-inline">public</strong>, though this is not recommended in most cases due to encapsulation principles. Within <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>a method or function, you do not need to redeclare the variable type; it was already specified when the variable was initially declared. It is a common practice to start a private field’s name with an <span class="No-Break">underscore character.</span></p>
			<h3>Exploring control structures</h3>
			<p>Control structures are pivotal elements in C#<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> programming, guiding the execution flow within scripts. Among these, <strong class="source-inline">If-Then</strong> statements are particularly common. They evaluate a variable’s value; if <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, a specific code block runs, otherwise, it’s bypassed. This enables scripts to react dynamically to different conditions and states within <span class="No-Break">the game.</span></p>
			<p>Loops form another critical category of control structures, repeatedly executing a code block based on a condition. Unlike If-Then statements, which perform a one-time check, loops continue until a certain condition is met. The <strong class="source-inline">For-Next</strong> loop is ideal for scenarios with a predetermined iteration count, ensuring a code segment runs a specific number of times. On the other hand, the <strong class="source-inline">While</strong> loop is suited for less definite situations, such as continuously checking a condition such as a player’s status (e.g., “while the player is falling”), and executing the loop’s body until the condition changes. Another example is using a <strong class="source-inline">While</strong> loop to keep spawning enemies until the player reaches a certain <span class="No-Break">score threshold.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding and effectively utilizing these control structures is essential for creating responsive and efficient game logic in Unity <span class="No-Break">using C#.</span></p>
			<h3>Exploring functions and methods</h3>
			<p>In Unity, when you’re making games with C#, you’ll hear a lot about <strong class="bold">functions</strong> and <strong class="bold">methods</strong>. Think of them as special boxes of instructions<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> that do specific jobs. In C#, we <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>usually call these boxes <em class="italic">methods</em>, but it’s just like functions in other <span class="No-Break">coding languages.</span></p>
			<p>You can use these methods whenever you want to make something happen in your game. They help with all sorts of things, such as making your characters move, responding when players press buttons, or keeping track <span class="No-Break">of scores.</span></p>
			<p>It’s like having a bunch of helpful tools<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> in your toolbox. Whenever you need a particular job done, you pick the right<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> tool (or method) for that job. This makes your game’s code neat, easier to handle, and even lets you use the same tool for different parts of <span class="No-Break">your game.</span></p>
			<h4>Structure and syntax of functions/ methods</h4>
			<p>In C#, a method typically consists of a visibility keyword, a return type, a method name, and a set of parentheses, which <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>may contain parameters. The body of the method, enclosed in curly braces, contains the code to be executed. For instance, <strong class="source-inline">public void MovePlayer(float speed){}</strong> is a method in Unity that could move a player at a specified speed. The <strong class="source-inline">public</strong> keyword makes it accessible from other classes, <strong class="source-inline">void</strong> implies that it doesn’t return any value, and <strong class="source-inline">float speed</strong> is a parameter that can be passed to the method. Another example is <strong class="source-inline">private int CalculateScore(int points) { return points * 10; }</strong>, which is a <strong class="source-inline">private</strong> method that calculates and returns a player’s score based on the <span class="No-Break">points earned.</span></p>
			<h4>Common Unity methods</h4>
			<p>Unity provides several built-in methods that are essential in the game development life cycle. Methods such as <strong class="source-inline">Start()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Update()</strong> are the most frequently used. <strong class="source-inline">Start()</strong> is called before the first frame update, perfect for initializing variables or game states. <strong class="source-inline">Update()</strong>, on the other <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>hand, is called once per frame and is where you’ll primarily manage player inputs, update game logic, and handle <span class="No-Break">real-time interactions.</span></p>
			<h4>Custom methods for game mechanics</h4>
			<p>Beyond the standard methods, developers<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> can create custom methods to define specific behaviors or actions. For instance, a method named <strong class="source-inline">CalculateScore()</strong> could be created to update the player’s score. Custom methods enhance the modularity and reusability of your code, making your game more organized and easier to debug <span class="No-Break">and maintain.</span></p>
			<h3>Parameters and return types</h3>
			<p>Methods in C# can also have parameters and return types. Parameters allow you to pass values into a method, making them more dynamic and flexible. For example, a <strong class="source-inline">DealDamage(int damage)</strong> method can take an integer parameter to apply damage to a character. Return types, on<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> the other hand, enable methods to send back a value. A <strong class="source-inline">GetHealth()</strong> method might return an integer value representing a <span class="No-Break">character’s health.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Learning about classes</h2>
			<p>In the context of Unity game development, C# classes play a crucial role. They act as blueprints for every entity in <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>the game world, from the simplest UI element to the most complex characters and environments. Understanding classes in C# is vital for Unity developers, as they<a id="_idIndexMarker035"/> provide the structure and functionality to game objects, making them integral to creating immersive and interactive <span class="No-Break">game experiences.</span></p>
			<h3>Classes as blueprints for game objects</h3>
			<p>In Unity, a class defines the properties and behaviors of game objects. Think of a class as a template that describes the characteristics <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>and capabilities of something in the game. For instance, a <strong class="source-inline">Player</strong> class might include properties such as <strong class="source-inline">health</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">speed</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">strength</strong>, and behaviors such as <strong class="source-inline">move</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">jump</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">attack</strong>. When you create an instance of the <strong class="source-inline">Player</strong> class, you’re essentially creating a specific player character in your game with those properties <span class="No-Break">and behaviors.</span></p>
			<h3>Properties and behaviors defined by classes</h3>
			<p>The properties of a class are variables that hold data relevant to the object, such as scores, health points, or positional <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>coordinates. These properties can be simple data types such as integers and strings, or more complex types such as arrays or other classes. Behaviors, on the other hand, are defined by methods within the class. These methods contain the logic that dictates how an object acts or responds to game events. For example, a method within the <strong class="source-inline">Enemy</strong> class could dictate how the <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>enemy detects and chases <span class="No-Break">the player.</span></p>
			<h3>Mastering classes for complex game development</h3>
			<p>Mastering the use of classes is pivotal for developers aiming to create complex and interactive games. Classes allow for the encapsulation of data and functionality, leading to code that is more organized, modular, and reusable. This is particularly important in game development, where different types of objects often share properties and behaviors. By using classes effectively, you can create a hierarchy of game objects, inherit properties and behaviors, and<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> override them to create specialized behaviors. This not only streamlines the development process but also makes the code base more manageable <span class="No-Break">and scalable.</span></p>
			<p>In Unity, <strong class="source-inline">MonoBehaviour</strong> is a base class from which most game scripts are derived. It provides access to important life cycle methods such as <strong class="source-inline">Start</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Update</strong>, which are essential for game logic. Understanding how to extend <strong class="source-inline">MonoBehaviour</strong> and utilize its features is a key part of working effectively <span class="No-Break">with Unity.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we delved into the essentials of C# programming within Unity3D, starting with an introduction to key concepts such as data types and variables, crucial for managing game data. We progressed to control structures and methods, foundational for scripting game logic, and explored object-oriented principles through classes and objects, enhancing game component design. Additionally, we touched on Unity-specific scripting with MonoBehaviour and ScriptableObjects, concluding with an overview of extending the Unity Editor through scripting, equipping you with a solid foundation in C# for <span class="No-Break">game development.</span></p>
