- en: In the previous chapters, you examined solution selling, driving due diligence
    concepts, and solution envisioning with Sure Step. This chapter will walk you
    through the fascinating discipline of managing projects. The field of project
    management is emerging because quality has become a competitive instrument over
    the years. The **Project Management Institute** (**PMI**) defines project management
    as *the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities
    to meet project requirements*. Being a project manager in charge of software implementation
    projects is a challenging and demanding responsibility. Good project managers
    combine various skills in a balanced way. They need to bring leadership, communication,
    negotiation, problem solving, and influencing capabilities into practice in a
    unique and temporary environment. And when things go wrong, project managers usually
    find themselves in the eye of the storm. Nevertheless, managing projects brings
    great rewards. Successfully implementing business solutions implies that your
    customer organization will benefit from more efficiency in its daily routines
    because of your team's effort and quality. At the same time, you create and manage
    a context in which consultants can realize their professional ambitions.

    to project management is omnipresent and sometimes embedded in hard-to-shatter
    myths. The onus of proof rests with the plaintiff, and so we need to plead the
    project management cause for every assignment, which is a glaring contrast to
    the tolerance for the unstructured approach. Now what kind of resistance do we
    face? The opinion that project management has a lot of overhead is widespread.
    At the same time, it is often seen as an obstacle to flexibility. Many people
    consider project management as the theorizer's way of doing things diametrically
    opposed to the management's prime directive of getting things done.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'What is overhead? From a cost-accounting perspective, overhead costs are the
    costs incurred for operating a business but that do not generate revenue or profits
    directly. Typical overhead costs include those for accounting, advertising, depreciation,
    insurance, interest, legal fees, rent, repairs, supplies, taxes, telephone bills,
    travel, and utilities costs. Using this logic, the question of whether or not
    expense on project management is an overhead leads to another question: do we
    send invoices to our customers for the project management services that we provide?
    However, is this the crucial question? According to this line of reasoning, we
    should categorize our sales costs as an overhead and should not be invoicing the
    services of our sales teams. If we were to partly invoice our project managers,
    does this make the overhead question redundant?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the skeptics refer to project management as an overhead cost, they often
    think about a mountain of papers and quite a few procedures and administrative
    tasks associated with the project management discipline. This criticism can be
    legitimate when their project management practice is not scaled to the size and
    complexity of the projects or to their organizational structure. Ignorance is
    usually at the basis of these failing project management procedures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To answer the overhead question, we need to assess the benefits of our project
    management practice. Does it contribute to our project's profit and quality? Does
    it add value to our customers and team? If the answer to these two questions is
    positive, it is clearly not an overhead. If you cannot extract these benefits,
    your project management expenditure may be labeled as an overhead. Project management
    is what you and your organization make of it, and it can either turn into an overhead
    or a value-added service.
  prefs: []

    are probably right. But it tells you more about their project management practice

    but they instantly add that they fear the impact on the organizational flexibility.
    They think that project management procedures will decrease their ability to respond
    to unpredicted changes, and it doesn't take long before their reasoning sets project
    management against a pragmatic approach. So, isn't project management concerned
    with practical matters? Do we lose the ability to change, and does project management
    stand in the way of progress in our projects? These are the questions to be answered
    when testing the accuracy of this proposition.

    the inability to separate the essentials from the side issues. People struggling
    with this dilemma overemphasize the importance of all the described project management
    tools, documents, and steps of a methodology. They spend too much time administering
    and describing the project, losing valuable time for the real management of the
    project and its practical matters. A bureaucratic vision of project management
    causes a contrast with the "let's just get on with the job" approach.

    and flexibility. By keeping it result driven, lean, and mean, it will empower
    you to make the project happen. A good project manager is not a bureaucrat, but
    is a tightrope walker, balancing the need for administration, steps, and tools
    in each project. Now that's easier said than done, and it takes a seasoned project
    manager with thorough knowledge of the project management discipline to realize
    the structured flexibility. Although unskilled and inexperienced project managers
    tend to get a hold of the rigid procedures, company executives cannot go scot-free
    either when speaking about obstacles to flexibility. They are responsible for
    the company's culture, and this culture represents the limit of what is achievable
    for the company.

    you to answer this question by yourself. A project management practice that unleashes
    value and benefits for the customer must be salable. If you can't get it sold,
    you struggle to sell the value of your methodology and/or you cannot convince
    the customer of the need for it. This can be related to the intrinsic values of
    your methodology or to a failing sales process. We are used to selling our software,
    business consultancy services, and development expertise, but how familiar are
    we with selling a project management service? Do we have a good selling strategy
    in place for valuing this type of service? If you want to get project management
    sold, it must be a real element of your adaptable value proposition, necessary
    for good bridge selling. Your customer or prospect may not be familiar with the
    landscape of implementation projects and the need for project management, and
    they may be nervous or even frightened to traverse it. Your value proposition
    for project management services needs to be flexible and adaptable to variations
    in each opportunity. A notable fact is that those who claim not to be able to
    sell project management have no adaptable value proposition for it, and yet price
    their project managers as the most expensive individuals on the team. In this
    way, they create their own obstacles.

    some resources, and there you go. Some people don't even realize that their projects
    weren't lucrative until the end of the fiscal year, when accountants call executives
    to account. A project is a synonym for risk, and if you want to realize the essential
    goals of profitability and customer satisfaction, you need to manage the risks.
    This is why you need project management, not as a side issue, but as an essential
    vehicle for your project's business.

    delivered on time and within budget and scope. But are these goals **SMART** (**specific**,
    **measurable**, **attainable**, **relevant**, and **time-bound**) enough? If you
    want a project management practice that is pragmatic, you need to define pragmatic
    goals as well. What does it need to succeed in your organization and your specific
    projects? How can it be valuable to your people and your customers? Be specific
    about it. Most companies have a set of specific metrics for their sales, marketing,
    finance, and operational systems and services based on well-considered and specific
    objectives. If projects are the essential component of your services business,
    you need to have these objectives as well for your project management practice.
    Without them, it's a hard road to improve on your project's profit and customer
    satisfaction. Yes, "on time" and "within budget" is measurable, but can you measure
    "within scope" and "meets quality expectations" without set specifications? How
    is your current project management practice contributing to these goals? What
    would be the effect if your current project management procedures were put on
    hold? How can you improve your project management practice in the future, or will
    you still be working with exactly the same procedures in a few years? There's
    room for smarter objectives if you are really seeking a value-adding project management
    practice. So, before you start beating your brains out on how to implement a project
    management methodology, start defining why you need it and what it needs to achieve.
    Now, where do you start?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    contribute to your company's success. It demands a strong vision on your service
    delivery strategy, your company's strengths and weaknesses, your customer portfolio
    and sector, and your employee mix and project history. Your project management
    goals need to be embedded in this context, and at the same time, they need to
    be very specific in different disciplines. You can start by developing a breakdown
    of areas where you will define objectives to be realized and measured.

    If the customer is willing to pay for these services on their engagements, the

    the deployment of project management principles on their projects dependent on
    the ability to sell the project and on the customer's ability to understand the
    need for project management. Failing to get a customer budget for project management
    implies an unmanaged implementation. You certainly know the cases where a sales
    manager communicates that there is little (if any) budget for project management.
    Then what happens? It's a remarkable fact that, in these circumstances, a project
    manager will be assigned. No budget means lacking project management, but a project
    manager is assigned nevertheless. Who wants to be in this person's shoes? Usually,
    a seasoned consultant with a track record of good product experience gets the
    honor of managing this assignment. This person needs to be the doer as well as
    the manager at the same time, requiring a complex straddle that is hard to perform
    even when a significant number of days are available for the task. Now this poor
    project manager needs to go through this exercise, knowing that there is no official
    project management time available. Don't forget that risks are not dependent on
    reward. Our seasoned product specialist will face the same level of risks as when
    a significant project management budget would have been available. In most of
    these cases, no clear and formal agreements are made in terms of the project risks.

    job would have cost if one had been in place. In the best case scenario, the organization
    is aware of this extra time spent on the specific project, but in many cases,
    people try to cover up by creative reporting in their timesheets. In that case,

    products continuously. In doing so, they have come a long way making use of modern
    methods for quality control and improvement. You have probably encountered customer
    organizations where methods such as **ISO** (**International Organization for
    Standardization**), **Total Quality Management** (**TQM**), Six Sigma, Kaizen,
    or the Deming Cycle are used. These days, quality awareness is the rule rather
    than the exception, as quality has become a competitive instrument over the years.
    One of the best examples illustrating this is Toyota. They became the largest
    car manufacturer in the world, owing a great part of this success to their quality
    management strategy and the branding of it. Many others followed, either inspired
    by the example of successful quality companies such as Toyota, or even because
    they were forced to do so. Today, many suppliers don't have a choice, but need
    to conform to standards such as ISO. As IT professionals, we do not have to look
    far to see quality management arising in our daily jobs as well. **Information
    Technology Infrastructure Library** (**ITIL**), a widely-adopted and consistent
    documentation of best practice for **IT service management** (**ITSM**) and **Capability
    Maturity Model Integration** (**CMMI**), a process-improvement approach that helps

    So when you plan to implement a software solution in this type of a company, it
    should not come as a surprise if they are looking for a quality approach demonstrating
    proactive ability. To do so, you not only need to have a good implementation methodology
    in place, but you also need to be able to capture, demonstrate, and realize the
    real value of this methodology. A few slides on phases, meetings, and a planning
    sheet will no longer be sufficient. Let's not mince words—quality management is
    on the rise and this will have a significant impact on how customers will expect
    you to manage your projects. You can no longer sell quality by means of individual
    efforts and heroics. Instead, you need to demonstrate a repeatable, integrated,

    sales process. Meetings, follow-up calls, demonstrations, customer interviews,
    and account management visits are all part of the planned interaction management
    to close the deal. Because of these interactions, we also have the possibility
    of having good communication with our customer's stakeholders. Interacting with
    them means that we must speak with and listen to them, basic conditions for effective
    communication.

    typically still have sufficient planned interactions by means of kickoff meetings,
    workshops, and interview sessions. However, after these activities, interaction
    levels may drop significantly. We tend to isolate ourselves during design and
    development phases while working on technical and functional designs and executing
    development activities. Some people blame this on the involvement of technical
    consultants in these stages of the project life cycle. This is due to the stereotypical
    view that people have about technical consultants. These consultants start to
    become quite active during the design and development activities and are known
    for not being the best communicators. If this is what you were thinking, you''ll
    need to think again. The problem is not that some people carry out their tasks
    in a concentrated way for which they need an isolated environment. Rather, it
    is that no other activities triggering customer interactions are planned. This
    kind of planning, lacking a sufficiently planned level of customer interactions,
    endangers your project communication. This creates a "communication black hole"
    that can be quite large if the durations of your design and development phases
    are significantly long. Think about the impact: no customer interaction means
    no communication and no customer involvement.'

    level suddenly starts to rise again. That is because we often have an overplanned
    deployment phase. Everything we didn't plan for in the design and development
    phases needs to be done in the deployment phase, resulting in many customer interactions.
    Now maybe after months of low levels of customer interaction and communication,
    we suddenly need to communicate and interact ceaselessly. This won't be easy for
    the consulting and customer teams as they are missing communication routines and
    culture by now. In this kind of scenario, you also need to communicate a lot in
    a short amount of time. The receiver of your communication will experience problems

    the intrinsic quality of fulfilling these goals. As said earlier, there are a
    good deal of complaints about those project documents that nobody ever appears

    serve as an alibi for a so-called quality approach, but usually only represent
    a one-way ticket for the file cabinet. These documents are experienced by most

    Doing your project documentation is not a championship in writing the most number

    document saying it all in a few lines. Most of these long project documents are
    unstructured, miss good conclusions, and contain too many gray areas. They also
    tend to get out of balance in terms of content, including having too much content
    devoted to introductions and less complicated topics, while lacking good content
    on the more complex and rather important issues. This makes these documents not
    only hard to read but incomplete as well. Why do we need so much paper to bring
    insignificant content? Now put yourself in your customer's position for a minute.

    you like to read a fifty-page document lacking finer points and conclusions?

    long technical descriptions. Communicate in the language that your customers use

    maintain complex spreadsheets in which all of their project data is centralized.
    These spreadsheets include complex formulas, generating all kinds of trends and
    results for the project. There is nothing wrong with these spreadsheets, but by
    themselves, these tools do not manage anything. These tools need to provide the

    steering or correcting. They need to trigger proactive and corrective project
    management action. This is what project management is all about—being proactive

    that can impact our time and cost performance. So, if we want to provide reassurances
    about time and budget, among other things, we need to manage these daily risks
    and issues proactively. To start with, this approach requires that we know our
    issues and risks. We can identify them only by interacting with the customer.
    Interactions such as testing, validating solutions and concepts, meetings, and
    evaluation moments usually reveal our project's issues and risks. It is very unlikely
    that you will discover issues and risks at times where the interaction level is
    low. Secondly, we need to make sure that we identify our challenges as early as
    possible.

    planned most of your customer interactions for the end-of-the-project life cycle,
    your ability to achieve proactive management will drop significantly. Similarly,
    you will lose your ability for proactive management when you and your team postpone
    all customer interactions to the end of the project life cycle. So, concentrating
    on customer interactions in the beginning and at the end of the project cycle
    will not give you the necessary opportunities to be proactive. How you plan and

    to be proactive in your projects, you need to think really hard about what you
    want to measure. A proactive manager reads the impact of the current progress
    on future activities in their projects. You want to know if your current performance
    will cause cost and time overruns and you need to know why. So, if you are using
    an advanced spreadsheet to measure your performance, you need to ask yourself
    if it tells you something about the future of your project or only informs you
    about the past performance of this project. Your measurement can only reveal early
    warning signals when you are not reporting hot air. Your measurement needs to
    be based on the integration of scope, schedule, and cost. So, if you do not have
    a definition of your scope, schedule, and associated costs, you cannot expect
    to measure early warning signals.

    you ask the customer to sign off for the delivery of the project, and once signed,
    your project is closed. Unfortunately, most of us have experienced that closing
    usually doesn't go off that smoothly. In fact, many projects remain unclosed forever.
  prefs: []

    of closing. Analysts focus on the delivery of good business process descriptions
    and the capturing of requirements, developers want to show their superior technical

    Indicators** (**KPIs**). As a group, their key target is to deploy a new solution,
    followed by a successful Go-Live. This is basically what they have on their radar.
    But who is responsible for working towards closing? Closing is not as self-evident
    for project managers as it is for sales people. Closing is a key element in the
    sales cycle, and being able to close a deal is the key strength of a sales manager.
    They are aware of this crucial process and improve themselves continuously in
    their closing skills. If we want to be more successful at closing our projects,
    we need to start realizing a closing culture within our project teams. Why we
    need to close, how can we facilitate the closing process, and who is responsible
    for closing are some crucial questions we need to find the answers to.

    Not closing a project will transition it from a project to an operation. Unfortunately,
    we do not have a budget for that operation, and we probably do not have a defined
    way of managing operations at customer websites either. This can become a true
    burden. If not closed, customers will continue to ask for all kinds of changes,
    enhancements, and various services for which funding will be under discussion.
    You will end up having a lot of meetings trying to find compromises to determine
    what is still within the scope of the project and what is not, and you will need
    to do this for as long as the project isn't closed. Maybe your project was profitable
    until Go-Live, but at this point, your profit is starting to get squeezed dry.
    There are also important psychological elements attached to closing. Successful
    closing reinforces the feeling of success. People need successes in their professional
    careers to stay motivated, and success gives them the incentive to carry on striving
    for ultimate success in their future projects. The customer team members will
    share the sensation of having realized something important for their company,
    and they will share the benefits with the entire organization. And after all of
    the hard work and effort, they are entitled to this moment of glory. When we do
    not close our project, other psychological effects will unfold. With no clear
    end to the tunnel, people will tend to think negatively about the project and
    will feel discouraged.

    A and B? The teams will need to execute exactly the same activities in both projects,
    generating the same deliverables in the same time frame and budget. The only difference
    is that Project A is organized into four phases, while Project B is executed in
    one and only one phase. In Project A, the teams can start working on technical
    and functional designs only when the planned interviews, workshops, and documentation
    activities are finished, and all of the deliverables are generated. This will
    be controlled and validated by both consulting and customer project managers.
    In Project B, the teams may have already started development before the technical
    designs are ready, and there are no real formal evaluation moments planned in
    between the activities and deliverables. So, the nature of the work is not changed,
    but by using phases, you control and validate the progress at defined moments.
    The purpose of this approach is to organize and control your timeline, leading
    to more management control. Thus, the ability of the project manager to really
    manage the progress is increased significantly in project A and the chances of
    success are therefore much higher in Project A than they are in Project B.

    in which a decision maker relies upon the knowledge that is readily available
    rather than examining other alternatives or procedures. In other words, people
    have difficulties imagining all of the ways events can unfold, and out of sight
    equals out of mind. Therefore, we tend to assume that everything will go as we
    expect and this makes us overconfident in our estimation at the beginning of the
    project life cycle.

    alternative scripts for how the project may unfold, drawing hierarchical diagrams
    of all that can go wrong, making explicit assumptions, and asking others to challenge
    us. WBS is an excellent tool in your estimation tool set, and it will prevent
    you from assuming and forgetting too many things while estimating. The creation
    of a WBS will make you think of many possible events in your project. Even better
    is the use of WBS templates. These are WBSs developed on the basis of previous
    projects. If you combine this with the use of project types for which you have
    an associated template WBS, your estimation accuracy will most certainly increase.

    estimation. We usually estimate the solution size or package complexity, including
    things such as the configuration effort to suit the requirements of the business
    processes, and the effort to produce custom objects to address the gaps in the
    application. In this context, we also evaluate the implementation and business
    complexity, but we sometimes forget to take the organizational complexity into
    consideration. Recent studies have identified that the implementation effort not
    only grows with the number of modules and submodules that are selected for the
    implementation, but that each user also adds an organization component of costs.
    We need to make sure that we include all of the complexity in our estimation scope.
    This may also be really relevant when we implement our solution in different departments
    of our customer''s organization. The different departments will have different
    users, and they can have varying experience and skills in terms of software solutions

    departments invest time in recruiting the right employees, with regards to their
    knowledge and their commitment to the company. Happy employees are usually more
    motivated, and the extent to which they align their motivation with the company's
    goals is linked to your customers' satisfaction. Every employee needs to experience
    success in the daily job. Queuing unclosed and unsuccessful projects is a burden
    gnawing employee motivation. It goes without saying that customer satisfaction
    is also directly connected to your project's success. Solid and effective project
    management practices will significantly increase your project success, which is
    proven and illustrated by many independent consulting surveys and reports. Your
    customers and employees will be much happier when your company develops an implementation
    methodology to such a level that it is a core competency.
