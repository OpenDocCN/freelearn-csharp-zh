<div><p class="calibre_1">Invention of Mechanics</p><p class="calibre_2">Now that we know how to adapt game mechanics and which processes are available to do so, it's time to focus on one of the most challenging and exciting tasks for a game designer: coming up with brand new game mechanics! The difference between adapting and creating new mechanics is thin, though. We will see in this chapter how new game mechanics can be created not only as actions available to the players but also as different dynamics that are generated in-game by existing core mechanics.</p><p class="calibre_2">We will discuss some of the theories behind game design and the creation of mechanics that are fun to play, and we'll dive into how a new mechanic needs to be taught to the player and how the core loop of a game is formed. Finally, we're going to have a close look at the design of a combat system and why combat and conflict are an important part of many video games. You will learn about complexity and depth and the related problems a game designer needs to solve by using them.</p><p class="calibre_2">This chapter is probably the most important in the entire book. We will need to look further afield at game design theory and be less practical for a while. It is still going to be a quick overview though. Therefore, we highly recommend that you use this as a base, from which you'll be able to follow up on and deepen your knowledge. Don't be scared if you feel overwhelmed by all this information. Every book, author, and article we're going to quote can be found at the end of this book in the bibliography.</p><p class="calibre_2">Ready?</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's go.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Developing an idea into an experience</p><p class="calibre_2">The main reason for creating a new game mechanic can be described as the need to give the player a novel experience. We learned how the game vision gives us designers a clear direction to follow in order to develop our games. By visualizing the experience we want our players to have, we are taking the first step into the conceptualization of a new game mechanic.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's see a practical example.</p><p class="calibre_2">Modern First Person Shooter (FPS) games are very different from what we used to play in the 80s and the 90s. When we immersed ourselves in a frenetic shooting game all we needed were some interesting enemies, a few different weapons, and just a bunch of basic controls, such as move and shoot.</p><p class="calibre_2">In a quest for better immersion, game designers started to ask questions like: "How can we make an FPS more realistic?", "How can we make shooting more tactical?", and "How can we give players the impression that they are in the middle of a real shooting scenario?"</p><p class="calibre_2">A real gunfight scenario is miles away from a video game such as Wolfenstein and Quake, where the player can basically storm the enemies, shooting loads of ammunition at them and withstanding heavy fire with no hesitation. Imagine your task as a designer is to add more strategy to those classic FPS games, in order to evoke a more realistic shooting scenario. Which mechanics would you add to a game with only move and shoot mechanics?</p><p class="calibre_2">There are many correct answers to this question, so before we keep reading, try imagining a couple of those!</p><p class="calibre_2">Done? Great!</p><p class="calibre_2">A common answer would be: Adding cover.</p><p class="calibre_2">In a real gunfight, you don't usually see people running toward their enemies guns blazing...that's typical of video games and movies! What people do, in reality, is take cover! They try to find a spot where they are protected from the bullets. Only once safe, might they peek out just a little and try to return fire from behind the cover. Imagine if by pressing a button your character can crouch behind obstacles and take cover. And of course, enemies would be able to do the same. Can you visualize how different this game would be compared to the basic FPS we started with?</p><p class="calibre_2">Now you can go even further. Can your character shoot from behind the cover? (In a way, that is different from just leaving the cover and shooting...maybe he is less precise from there? Or can only do suppressive fire…) Can your character move from cover to cover, head down, instead of just walking or running between them?</p><p class="calibre_2">Naughty Dog's
Uncharted and Ubisoft's The Division are great examples of third-person tactical combat systems. Finding the right spots to take cover and moving between them is crucial to winning the fight. It also gives the player the freedom to choose how to tackle different encounters and how to exploit the terrain.</p><p class="calibre_2">Of course, how the enemies react to the players' behavior is as important as the mechanics available. Enemies might use different weapons to drive the player out of covers, such as grenades or heavy fire capable of destroying those covers. Or maybe there could be enemies with melee weapons running toward the player while he's behind cover.</p><p class="calibre_2">Addressing the need for a tactical and challenging game experience is the key to the creation of interesting mechanics and dynamics. It is important to note that realism doesn't have to always be the experience we want to give to the player. In fact, some game designers might want exactly the opposite. This is the case with games such as the latest version of Doom (2016). The idea behind the combat system was to go back to the roots of the FPS genre, offering visceral shootings and frenetic actions. How could you obtain that kind of experience if the game offers mechanics such as cover and stealth actions?</p><p class="calibre_2">To go back to the most frenetic FPS action, Doom's game designers came up with a new game mechanic: Glory Kills. In short, by hammering an enemy with bullets, the player can stagger him and then perform a special melee attack that instantly (and quite brutally) kills him.</p><p class="calibre_2">While performing a glory kill the player is invulnerable and the enemy always drops extra items such as ammunition and health. So, performing a glory kill is a rewarding tactical option that forces the player to approach combat in a very aggressive way and always move forward. All these are great examples of new game mechanics created from the experience we want the player to have. Let's do another example, with a completely different genre and mechanic.</p><p class="calibre_2">Adventure, role-playing games, and in general, games based on narratives are often based on conversations and interactions with NPCs. In these games, dialogs are as important as action, and the player is challenged with critical choices to make. A classic mechanic to manage dialogues with multiple options is called branched dialogues.</p><p class="calibre_2">Different lines open different branches of the dialogue, which usually lead to different outcomes and consequences. But how can one add tension and a sense of pressure if the player can take all the time in the word to make his choice? In the internet era, players are even able to pause the game and look for the best answer online in a matter of minutes.</p><p class="calibre_2">In the early 90s, Sega's Sakura Wars answered this question using a real-time conversation system, in which the player has only a few seconds to decide which option to take. This incredibly simple mechanic changes everything. Many modern adventure games have taken inspiration from that mechanic. Telltale Games is famous for its narrative games based on real-time conversations, which in the past few years have revamped the interest in the genre.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">New mechanics to solve a problem</p><p class="calibre_2">Sometimes new mechanics are required to solve well-known gameplay problems. This is a typical scenario in live games (for example mobile games or Massively Multiplayer Online Games), where the game is constantly updated and adjusted to meet its audience's evolving needs. But it might as well be the case for sequels, franchises, and final releases after an alpha or a beta test.</p><p class="calibre_2">One great example is the Chest mechanic in Clash Royale, one of the most interesting game mechanics in the history of mobile games (and one that has contributed to the incredible success of Supercell's real-time PvP title.)</p><p class="calibre_2">This is how it works:</p><p class="calibre_2">In Clash Royale, by winning a battle, players win chests. Chests contain Cards and Gold, both essential for player's progression. These chests must be unlocked before the player can get the rewards they contain. Unlocking a chest takes a certain amount of time. Alternatively, this wait can be skipped using Gems (the equivalent of real money). Each player has four chest slots, so they can only have up to four chests waiting at a time. It is still possible to battle when the chest slots are full, but no chests will be won, as all the slots are already taken.</p><p class="calibre_2">Which issues do you think this mechanic has tackled and solved?<br class="calibre1"/> Think about it for a few minutes before reading on. It is clear how Supercell addressed some of the major problems in F2P mobile games, that is, how to organically integrate:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Sessioning (how long and how often a play session should be)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Retention (why should a player come back to the game)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Monetization (if a player can’t wait to open a chest...he can always spend some hard currency to do so)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Progression (opening chests is the main way to obtain new cards and therefore upgrade your deck and progress through the game)</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">In most mobile games, each of those critical issues is specifically addressed with a set of features that sometimes feel disconnected and sort of artificially constructed. The elegance by which Supercell integrated everything in one single mechanic is a testament to their astonishing talent and massive success.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">It is quite difficult to find completely new game mechanics in the Console and AAA space. Innovation usually means risk, and big projects are not the best for risk. This is why indie games and mobile games usually present a lot of much more innovative features (and sometimes, they are disruptive in their genre). Always keep an eye on the indie and mobile scene and see what designers are doing to solve common design problems in more efficient and elegant ways.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">New mechanics to innovate</p><p class="calibre_2">Another way to come up with a new mechanic is by asking yourself how things can be done differently. Thinking out of the box is a crucial skill for every game designer. What if is a great question to start with something you know or are familiar with and completely re-invent it.</p><p class="calibre_2">A question like "What if we introduce zero-gravity in Super Mario?" can open an ocean of new possibilities and unexplored mechanics and gameplay. When trying to innovate, the less is more principle comes in handy again. Many games have innovated entire genres by taking out something from existing games.</p><p class="calibre_2">"What if in a platform game the character automatically runs in only one direction and the only action available to the player is jumping?" That is why, Canabalt (2009) was born, re-inventing the platform genre...actually, inventing (or more precisely, popularizing—see the following information box) a new one: the Endless Runner.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">While the Endless Runner concept was long known in Korea, journalists credit Canabalt as the title that single-handedly invented the smartphone-friendly single-button running genre and generated not only countless clones, by many great original games that rely on that mechanic, including Super Mario Run from Nintendo.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">The process of innovating is the most difficult to follow, but it's the one that usually raises the bar to the next level. The games (and game designers) that are able to do that are the ones that are leaving a mark on the history of games and gaming. Of course, not all the new mechanics are innovative, as with innovation here we mean something that evolves or revolutionizes a way of doing something.</p><p class="calibre_2">It is important to note, though, that innovation can spark from any of the previously mentioned approaches. What is different is that some game designers make games (or part of games) with the precise intention of innovating and that this, as you can imagine, requires a specific approach.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Building a new game mechanic</p><p class="calibre_2">In order to be able to invent a new game mechanic, we need to go back to some theory. Understanding how to classify different mechanics, why they are fun, and what kind of player they appeal to is extremely important if we want to come up with something new. Some sort of seed is required to grow our innovative ideas into new game mechanics.</p><p class="calibre_2">There are many classifications and definitions of fun, type of players, and game mechanics: they are all valid, (well maybe some are objectively better than the others…). There will be many opportunities to read and study all of them in your career and I strongly encourage you to do so. Personally, among all the studies I've read, I prefer three authors over the others and I think their approach to such theoretical topics is the best for a book about Practical Game Design.</p><p class="calibre_2">These authors and the respective topics they have covered are:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Richard Bartle, with his categorization of player types</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Nicole Lazzaro and her study about the four types of fun</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Jesse Shell and his taxonomy of game mechanics</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">In the next paragraphs, we're going to explore these topics. By understanding them, you will be able to design better game mechanics and ultimately better player experiences.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">Many times in your career you will come across decision and designs that are the result of your instinct and designer sensibility. There will be times where you will apply game design theory without even knowing it. What defines a good game designer (and game design), though, is how much you will be able to catch all those intuitions and explain them using the knowledge you have acquired through studying and reading. Every time you are not entirely sure of why something is that way, go back to the books and make sure you actually know what you're doing!</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Bartle's types of players</p><p class="calibre_2">Richard Bartle is the creator of the first virtual world (it was called Multi-User Dungeon (MUD), 1978) and one of the most important scholars and authors in our industry. In his studies, he categorized the kind of players who enjoy playing in virtual worlds (a categorization that can also be applied to other kinds of games but which it is worth pointing out that was intended by the author for Massively Multiplayer Online Games only).</p><p class="calibre_2">He identified four main types of player:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Achievers</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Socializers</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Explorers</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Killers</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Let's have a closer look at each category and try to understand why it is so crucial for a game designer to understand them.</p><p class="calibre_2">The Achievers are the players who enjoy setting and reaching the goals set within the game. These goals might be explicitly set by the game itself (such as win conditions, quests to solve, leaderboard to climb, collections to complete) or they might enjoy setting up goals for themselves (such as completing a game without ever losing or in the shortest amount of time possible). Achievers want to Max Out the game, in a way that could either be intended by its design or not.</p><p class="calibre_2">The Socializers draw fun from the interactions they have with other people in the game. It goes by itself that multiplayer games are the best games for this type of players, but don't forget that social interactions might be built even outside the game world in many ways.</p><p class="calibre_2">The incredible popularity of Facebook and social games, which started around 2008, is basically all thanks to these players. And it is safe to say that even the popularity of the whole video game medium owes much to the players who care about sharing their experiences as much as playing them.</p><p class="calibre_2">The Explorers are the players that enjoy to immerse themselves in every bit of knowledge the game has to offer. It might be the lore of an RPG game such as The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, or the rules and the cards in a Collectible Trading Card Game such as Magic: The Gathering. The Explorers are the experts of game worlds. They are the players that, most of the time, end up knowing the games even better than the game creators.</p><p class="calibre_2">The Killers, lastly, are players driven by the desire of dominating the thrill of competition. These are the highly competitive players that see video games as a sport and they constantly try to get better to dominate the others. As opposed to the Achievers, the Killers' desire to get better is driven by the only goal of defeating other players, not so much by the joy of progress:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00195.jpg" class="calibre_35"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Bartle's four types of player and how they act and interact with both the virtual world and other players</p><p class="calibre_2">Bartle's study goes much more in depth, analyzing the interactions between these categories and how they influence the design and the entire existence of virtual worlds (by which Bartle means explicitly what we would define as Mass Multiplayer Online Games). Again, his books are a highly recommended read.</p><p class="calibre_2">In regard to how to use player types to create new game mechanics, it is clear how important it is to understand your audience and then design with that in mind. That said, two things must never be forgotten: great games provide fun mechanics to every kind of player, and some players might well have many facets, enjoying being Explorers one time and Killers another time.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Lazzaro's types of fun</p><p class="calibre_2">Nicole Lazzaro proposes a similar model to Bartle's, but instead of focusing on players, she focuses on their emotions and the kind of fun they have while playing games. She defined four keys to fun and states that for a game to be fun (generally speaking), at least three out of four of these keys to fun must exist in the game experience.</p><p class="calibre_2">Each key to fun corresponds to some fundamental human emotions:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Hard Fun: Frustration and Fiero, in the moment of personal triumph over adversity</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Easy Fun: Curiosity, Awe</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Serious Fun: Excitement and Relief (relaxation)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">People Fun: Amusement, Joy</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">You can already see the connection with Bartle's model. But don't make the mistake of thinking that People Fun is the type of fun Socializers might experience or Easy Fun is the type of fun Explorers experience. It doesn't work like that and as we said, a good game proposes at least three out of four types of fun to every player:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00162.jpg" class="calibre_36"/></p><p class="calibre_70">Lazzaro's four keys to fun. A set of actions within the game triggers a specific emotion in the player and therefore enables a specific type of fun</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's have a look at a practical example of a couple of popular games.</p><p class="calibre_2">The Dark Souls franchise is famous for its difficulty and the great anger and frustration that it causes to players (are you already seeing the point?) That is, of course, its Hard Fun component. The frustration of repeatedly dying in the search of an optimal strategy is directly proportional to the triumph experienced for winning. That feeling of obtaining a meaningful victory is something really powerful.</p><p class="calibre_2">Hard Fun and Serious Fun go hand in hand in Dark Souls; the difficulty of the fights is what generates the frustration in players who get beaten, but it is also what makes it meaningful to progress, level up, find the right equipment, and strategize.</p><p class="calibre_2">The adrenaline rush when the boss fight begins is a powerful emotion that only a difficult situation can provide.</p><p class="calibre_2">What about the Easy Fun? You might think that a game such as Dark Souls doesn't give many opportunities for Easy Fun...but just look at how many memes there are over the internet! The game might not have been designed with those funny moments in mind, but still, by providing a playground for players' creativity, the game designers have opened the possibility for a lot of Easy Fun.</p><p class="calibre_2">The gesture feature (the player earns moves such as waving or cheering) and how it has been used to capture funny screenshots of the game is a perfect example of Easy Fun (combined with Social Fun, as part of it is sharing those screenshots or video on the internet).</p><p class="calibre_2">Another great example is the Easy Fun provided by a compelling control system. If you think that just rolling around in Dark Souls or jumping your way to your destination is quicker than just running...you're experiencing Easy Fun!</p><p class="calibre_2">People Fun (or Social Fun) is the most straightforward. Whether it is the co-op feature or the PvP, Dark Souls provides all you need to experience People Fun. But again, when we talk about social fun and interactions with real players, always think out-of-the-box (out of the game in this case). Social Fun in video games comes from outside the world of the game. Games that are enjoyable just by being watched or eSports (such as League of Legends) that people enjoy watching as much as they enjoy playing offer incredible opportunities, and quite real emotions and fun. Keep that in mind when you design your game mechanics. In modern games, Watchability is as important a character as Playability.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Shell's taxonomy of game mechanics</p><p class="calibre_2">Jesse Schell (in The Art of Game Design) has done excellent work defining a taxonomy of game mechanics. Each game mechanic you can think about almost certainly falls into one of the following categories:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Space</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Objects, Attributes, and States</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Actions</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Rules</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Skill</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Chance</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">By understanding these categories, you will be able to have a clear idea of how to collocate your new game mechanic and therefore deliver a more conscious design.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Mechanic 1 – space</p><p class="calibre_2">Space is the space in which the game takes place. According to Schell, all game space is:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Discrete or continuous</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Dimensional</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Discrete spaces (such as the grid in tic-tac-toe) have a limited number of cells or positions that may be filled or moved into, while continuous spaces (such as a football pitch) allow for unlimited movement within a limited space. By dimensions, Schell means whether a game is played on a 2D or 3D space. An improved graphical remake of a 2D platformer, for example, is still only played in two dimensions. Schell draws upon the field of architecture in order to explain how to design effective spaces.</p><p class="calibre_2">He sets out five types of game spaces:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Linear: A player can only basically move forward and backward (Monopoly)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Grid: Movement is restricted by discrete, adjacent shapes (Chess)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Graph: Several points connected by discrete paths (Talisman)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Points in Space: Several points with no specified connecting path (Final Fantasy)</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Divided Space: Space carved up into irregular sections (Risk)</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Mechanic 2 – objects, attributes, and states</p><p class="calibre_2">A game's space is filled with objects: characters, items, buildings, props, rocks, trees, and other characters. Basically, anything that can be interacted with in the game. In computer science terminology, these objects have attributes (position on the screen, visual appearance, statistics...) and a state (dead or alive, current speed, maximum speed, and so on) that help define them and how they interact with other game elements.</p><p class="calibre_2">Shell associates to objects and states the terms nouns and adjectives. You can describe each object of your game with a name and you can specify its attributes and states using adjectives. For example, a car (object) might have the following attributes: red (color), fast (speed), and coupè (type). These are all adjectives to describe the car - its attributes. It can also have a state, for example, whether it is moving or not.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Mechanic 3 – actions</p><p class="calibre_2">If objects and their attributes are nouns and adjectives: actions are the verbs. Steering, accelerating, braking. These verbs describe the actions available to the car object we discussed before.</p><p class="calibre_2">Schell describes two types of actions:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Operative actions</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Resultant actions</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Operative actions are the basic actions available in the game. Actions such as jumping, moving, shooting, reloading, and accelerating.</p><p class="calibre_2">Resultant actions are those that emerge from the operative actions. Accelerating and braking at the right time in a car racing game might result in overtaking the car ahead.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Mechanic 4 – rules</p><p class="calibre_2">We have seen how rules are not always considered proper game mechanics. According to Schell, rules are the most fundamental mechanic because they define the space, the objects, the actions, the consequences of the actions, the constraints of the actions, and the goals.</p><p class="calibre_2">Goals are probably the most important rule in every game. Goals must be always clear to both the designer and the player. Whether you prefer to consider rules part of the game mechanics or something that govern and determines how game mechanics interact together, don't forget that rules are a fundamental part of every game.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Mechanic 5 – skill</p><p class="calibre_2">To complete the tasks games present to them, players need skills. In order to create an adequately challenging experience, designers must balance player skill with game difficulty so that players stay interested and in a state of flow. Schell describes three types of skills within games:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Physical Skills: Which involve strength, dexterity, coordination, and physical endurance. In video games, this often includes reflexes and fine motor dexterity.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Mental Skills: Involving memory, observation, and puzzle solving.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Social Skills: Which include reading an opponent, predicting their movements, and coordinating actions with teammates.</li></ul><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Mechanic 6 – chance</p><p class="calibre_2">Chance is the sixth fundamental category of game mechanics. Chance adds unpredictability to a game experience, increasing replay value and diversifying gameplay. Games that include an element of chance leverage one of the basic human emotions: surprise. People like to be surprised, to experience unpredictable events and to challenge themselves predicting outcomes. In fact, Schell notes that the ability to predict outcomes is a skill in and of itself.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Game loops</p><p class="calibre_2">In his recent book Advanced Game Design: A Systems Approach, Michael Sellers – a game designer and professor – identified four principal loops that define a video game experience:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">The game's model loop</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">The player's mental loop</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">The interactive loop</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">The designer's loop</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Why do we call these loops? The idea is that a game is not a linear experience, but a looping structure where an action by the player generates an effect (and give a feedback); this effect allow the player to take another action and so on and so forth, in a loop.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Game's model and player's mental loops</p><p class="calibre_2">The game's model loop represents the dynamic world of the game. It is the combination of all the systems present in the game with which the player can interact. The player's loop, on the other hand, is the mental model of the game world that the player creates.</p><p class="calibre_2">The player builds his own mental loop based on the actual game model loop. He set his goals and executes actions that generate feedback in the game and continue to do so until his or her goal is achieved.</p><p class="calibre_2">The important thing about the player's mental loop is that the activities that a player executes in a game might not match with the game's model loop. Players can find their fun by not completing the game goals, but by setting their own and pursuing them. Maybe in an RTS game with the goal to defeat the enemy faction, some players might find it more fun and exciting to build a city of a particular shape, or to collect all the resources in the map. Or, in an open world RPG, they might prefer to go around and befriend all the animals in the world instead of following and completing the main quest.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Interactive loops</p><p class="calibre_2">The interactive loop determines the actions the player can take to interact with the world and the feedback that the game gives in response to those actions.</p><p class="calibre_2">The player's actions are basically inputs into the game's model loop, and the game feedback contributes to creating the player's own mental model loop. The interactive loop is made by a core loop and an extended loop, which we are going to describe in detail below.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Core loops</p><p class="calibre_2">By core loops, we mean the loop of basic actions the player needs to perform in a game.</p><p class="calibre_2">As we learned, these actions are a set of core mechanics that the player has to interact with. The loop happens when the player interacts with the mechanics over and over again in order to progress into the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">In fact, some designers have defined core mechanics exactly like that: The core mechanics in a game will usually be the purposeful interaction that occurs the most frequently. In a platforming game, this is usually jumping. In a shooter, it is usually shooting. In a racing game, it will be driving.</p><p class="calibre_2">There could be other definitions, as with every other game design concept. As we have said many times already, you don't have to stick with one particular definition of a game design concept. On the contrary, knowing more means you'd keep a clear idea of what other people’s points of view on each concept or principle are. We call them core loops because the core mechanic is an action that will produce some results, that will trigger a new need to perform the core mechanic...and so on:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="img/00013.jpg" class="calibre_37"/></p><p class="calibre_70">A simple core loop for an action-card game similar to Battlehand. The player fights battles to gain a currency (Fame, in this case). Fame is used to develop and upgrade the player's town. Upgrading the town unlocks the hero and card upgrade. With these upgraded, a more challenging battle can be fought</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Extended loops</p><p class="calibre_2">The extended loop is more complex (and a realistic representation of an entire game). Defining your core loop is part of deciding which new mechanics you might need in your game. Consider games such as The Witcher III: Wild Hunt and Middle Earth: Shadow of War. Both games' core loop consists of fighting enemies to get rewards and experience points. (You could argue that it’s the core loop of most RPG games, and it’s true, but not entirely. In fact, how you do that fighting is extremely important and quite different, for example, from a turn-based RPG.)</p><p class="calibre_2">So what makes The Witcher and Shadow of War two different games (apart from their settings and lore, of course)?</p><p class="calibre_2">It's the extended loop, and how all the different game mechanics interact with each other.</p><p class="calibre_2">In both games, the core loop (fighting enemies to get something) is related to the game's progression, and in both, there is a virtual skill system attached to it. What is really different is what you can do with what you get by defeating enemies and progressing through the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Geralt (the protagonist of The Witcher saga) can craft a variety of potions and alchemical items and can undertake quests to hunt monsters and interact with various Non-Playable-Characters (NPC), (with a lot of emphasis on romance). Most of the extended loop is related to expanding the narrative in different and new directions.</p><p class="calibre_2">Shadow of War approaches the extended loop in a different way: you can collect and organize your personal army of Orcs and then use it to lay siege to enemies' fortress or to defend yours. This feature, which completely changes the gameplay when the player immerses himself in the extended loop, is perfectly integrated with another unique selling point of the Shadow of Mordor franchise: the Nemesis System. The idea behind the Nemesis System is to create emergent stories unique to each player by allowing enemies to develop their own personalities, rivalries, and traits that may grow over time depending on the battles they take part in or the way the players defeat or get defeated by them.</p><p class="calibre_2">The depth of the system and the meaningfulness of these enemies and their development transformed the way players were playing the game. The core loop of solving the quests to proceed through the storyline and eventually finish the game was almost subverted by the extended loop of hunting those enemies and forging their stories. Of course, this was meticulously planned by Monolith's game designers, with a remarkable result. It is important to understand that different game modes can be seen as part of the extended loop of a game (for example, the different PvP modes in Blizzard's Overwatch) but as a designer, it is better to think about the core and extended loop as the actions that happen within a single game session.</p><p class="calibre_2">From a design perspective, the more the extended loops are integrated into the core loops and mechanics, the more organic and compelling the player experience will be.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Designer's loops</p><p class="calibre_2">Finally, there's the designer's loop. This is similar to the player's mental model, but this is the designer's mental model of the game. The main difference from the player's mental model is that the designer's loop is a perfect model of what the game and the player experience in the game should be.</p><p class="calibre_2">The designer's loop is the game design process in itself. Iterating by designing and testing a game form the designer's loop, where the feedback given by someone playing the game and the difference between that player feedback and the designer's intent generates that iterative process has already been discussed.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Games as systems of conflict</p><p class="calibre_2">According to a formal definition given by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman in their famous book Rules of Play, a game is "a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome."</p><p class="calibre_2">It's an interesting definition, perfect for deeply understanding game mechanics. It is easy to think about conflict in terms of war and triumph through competition, and this is indeed one of the reasons why games that represent fights and battles are so popular. But by conflict here, we really mean any kind of problem that is artificially created by the game designer for the player to solve. So why are these conflicts so important for the players and how can we create conflicts that are fun to solve?</p><p class="calibre_2">Conflicts can arise from three things:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Opponents</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Obstacles</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Dilemmas</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">You have to always keep these three things in mind when designing your game because no good game can exist without them.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Opponents</p><p class="calibre_2">The most obvious cause of a conflict is the fact that an opponent is trying to reach the same goal as the player or to simply prevent the player from getting there. In a single player game like Dark Souls, clearly every enemy in the game exists with only one purpose: kill your character and stop you from proceeding further into the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Multiplayer PvP games are so interesting because the game world is populated by real humans, all with the common goal of winning the game at the expense of the other players. Some games might have a much more abstract opponent-time, for example. A single player racing game in a time trial race, for example, doesn’t feature any opponents (neither human or AI).</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Obstacles</p><p class="calibre_2">Obstacles are very common in all kind of games. They might appear in the form of a physical object that blocks the player somehow from reaching their objective, or they might involve mental skills, such as puzzles in adventure games. Obstacles are different from the opponent because they don't have an objective and they are not driven by any motivation. Nonetheless, they challenge the player's mental and physical skill.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Dilemmas</p><p class="calibre_2">Dilemmas are probably the most important elements in a game and the type of conflicts they generate are often the most meaningful to the player experience. Dilemmas are the choices players have to constantly make when playing a game.</p><p class="calibre_2">The legendary game designer Sid Meier (Civilization franchise, among others) once said:</p><p class="calibre_2">"Games are a series of interesting decisions". The more meaningful those decisions, the better the player experience and the game will be. Choices in games are everywhere; how to invest resources in strategy games, which team and formation to select in a football game, which option to choose in a dialogue, which weapon to use in an FPS, which character to leave behind in a narrative game...</p><p class="calibre_2">Dilemmas have their impact from the macro to the micro. Even the smallest game mechanic needs to include an element of choice.</p><p class="calibre_2">Modern combat systems in action games express this principle in a great way. If you think about action games with a melee combat system today, you realize how many details are put into designing just the basics of the combat. Sometimes the player needs to make a choice at the start of the game, such as selecting a class, that will influence the entire game. The player also has to choose his gear (that is, which weapon to tackle the next battle with). During the combat, there might be strategic choices about charging the enemy or taking him out stealthily. And also: dodging or blocking with a shield? Using a slow but powerful attack or a series of quick ones?</p><p class="calibre_2">The choices in those games start from the macro (which character and gear I am going to use) to the micro (how to tackle this horde of enemies) to the even more micro (how to approach the fight with the enemy I'm attacking right now).</p><p class="calibre_2">No choices mean no agency over what's going on in the game, just button smashing through a repetitive sequence of events. Ultimately, no choice means no fun.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Quality over quantity</p><p class="calibre_2">It is important to note that with many choices comes great responsibility. A common pitfall in designing game mechanics considering the range of choices they offer is to go for quantity instead of quality.</p><p class="calibre_2">More choices don't translate into better games unless those choices are meaningful! If a dialogue with an NPC offers a vast range of possible answers, but none of them really affect the game with different consequences, or maybe 50% of them lead to a consequence and the other 50% to just another….that would be a pretty poor implementation.</p><p class="calibre_2">If striking an enemy with a quick attack produces the same outcome as using a heavy attack...it is as if there is no real choice at all.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">More choices, not best choices</p><p class="calibre_2">Yes, one choice could be the best one for a specific situation or scenario. But if that choice is designed to always be the same one...then, again, the game will be offering very few choices. If one class is stronger than the others in a competitive RPG game, why should a player choose the other? Or if a resource grants access to the best units in a strategy game, how would it be interesting to use or invest in the others?</p><p class="calibre_2">Sometimes, some choices are the best one a player could make, but there is a price to be paid for choosing them. We're going to see, in <a href="index_split_398.html#filepos890374"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 13</tt></a>, Balancing, how the outcome of each choice can be balanced in different ways. For example, how to mitigate a choice that is clearly the best one, with an element of risk (in the aforementioned Gears of War reload mechanic, for example).</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Wrapping up the theory</p><p class="calibre_2">At this point of the book, you have probably understood that designing and creating games cannot follow a specific step-by-step recipe that always and universally works. Each game is different and your platform, audience, and scope influence your design dramatically.</p><p class="calibre_2">This book is trying to convey a practical approach to game design and creating games, but never underestimate the importance of the theory. Behind any best practice or excellent design, there is the knowledge and the application of the principles we described. You have to learn and assimilate those principles by both studying and applying them. This is why the game industry is so avid about experienced game designers and why it's so hard to break into it as a junior or trainee game designer. Studying and applying your studies—by creating games—are inseparable parts of what makes a game designer.</p><p class="calibre_2">I can never recommend enough that you consolidate what you've read in the last few paragraphs. There are many articles online about those studies and, of course, the author’s books are an invaluable source of lessons, knowledge, and ideas on game design. Read and study those books!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Combat systems</p><p class="calibre_2">One of the major epitomes of the conflict metaphor is the combat. There are countless arguments against violence and depiction of fights and wars in video games, and indeed, because there is so much more to video games other than battles, fights, and violence, those arguments are often just empty words. It would be like condemning cinema because there are war movies. The reality about combat in video games (and all kind of games really) is that fighting is part of our nature. And while our society and culture have made it possible for us to avoid fights in our entire real lives, many people will always be fascinated by some of the characteristic elements of combat. Of course, many others won't. Not all games need to include combat, fights or violence at all, and there are millions of players not interested in playing games that involve any kind of violence.</p><p class="calibre_2">So, why is combat still so popular?</p><p class="calibre_2">First of all, combat means competition, one of the most powerful drivers in human nature. Combat also means engaging with an activity that challenges the player’s skill and intellect. Combat in games perfectly embodies Lazzaro's definition of Hard Fun and goes hand in hand with so many fantasies of our culture: Epic, Heroism, Commanding an army, Cloak and Dagger storylines, and many more.</p><p class="calibre_2">It is very likely that you will face the challenge of designing a combat system; that's why we decided to include an entire section about it in this chapter. As you are going to read, many of the teachings from this section are applicable to the design of any kind of game, so even if you're not interested in how combat systems work, read on and see what you can learn from them!</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">How to design a combat system</p><p class="calibre_2">When we talk about combat systems it is easy to think about games with stunning combat action and incredibly satisfying fights. Games such as Batman: Arkham Knight or Dark Souls have set a pretty high standard for how combat should be designed in action games. But truth be told, one of the greatest combat systems of all time still belongs to the King (and the Queen) of all games: Chess.</p><p class="calibre_2">There is only one combat mechanic in Chess: By moving one of your pieces onto an enemy piece, you take it (out of the game). Space represents the only element of Chess' combat mechanic. So how is it possible that just this simple mechanic is at the core of one of the most competitive and long-lived games of all times? The greatness of Chess, like any other games I would say, comes from the interaction of all its mechanics, and the space of possibilities that they open.</p><p class="calibre_2">The Move to Take mechanic, together with the chess board rules and movements available to the different pieces, create a perfect harmony of game mechanics from which an immensely vast range of possibilities emerges. So, to understand how to create a great combat system, you always need to take into account all the elements and the mechanics of the rest of your game.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Holistic game design</p><p class="calibre_2">Components such as art, animations, and sound effects have a huge impact on how a combat system feels (and on any other game mechanics) and your design should always be influenced and informed by the entire vision of the game you are developing. In modern game development, a new concept of game design has emerged, called holistic game Design; this means that the mechanics, aesthetics, and even every technical aspect of a game cannot exist as a separate entity anymore. And this is especially true in modern games where the level of realism is extreme. There is a great YouTube video that shows how awkward Battlefield 4 would be if it was using 8-bit sound effects from the 80's console era: <a href="https://youtu.be/7c1PBufdfcE"><tt class="calibre5">https://youtu.be/7c1PBufdfcE</tt></a>.</p><p class="calibre_2">Holistic game design teaches us that it is crucial to look at the big picture. There is a great talk by Naughty Dog's Anthony Newman, who goes into the details of the melee combat system in The Last of Us. In particular, it gives precious insights on how much the design of the combat mechanics is intertwined with how the characters in the game are animated and scripted. It also gives you an idea of the amount of work required in AAA games to create satisfying combat systems and how specialized the professionals who take on those challenges are. I really recommend that you watch it as soon as you have finished reading this chapter. You can find it at this link on YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ox2H3kUQByo"><tt class="calibre5">https://youtu.be/Ox2H3kUQByo</tt></a>.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Types of combat system</p><p class="calibre_2">A comprehensive list of all the combat systems that have been used in video games would be quite long. Surprisingly though, there are basically only two main categories:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Turn-based</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Real-time</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Turn-based games divide in-game actions into a series of distinct parts known as turns (a discrete time-space). Turn-based gaming is often associated with the combat systems in strategy, cards, and RPG games and is at the core of board games (both physical and digital). Typical examples are games such as Hearthstone, XCOM, or Civilization.</p><p class="calibre_2">In a real-time combat system, all the actions take place in a continuous time-space and therefore characters act as quickly as it takes for an action to be ready. The most prominent examples are actions games and FPS's, such as The Witcher, Call of Duty, or Starcraft.</p><p class="calibre_2">We could even add a third category: hybrid combat systems, which mix a bit of both real-time and turn-based, but the reality is that most of the time, the system underneath a hybrid combat system is always a turn-based one, implemented in a way that might feel like real time. Classic examples are RPGs such as Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate, and Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic.</p><p class="calibre_2">These games, in particular, look like they run in real time, but under the hood, there is a turn system that determines who can attack, move, or act. As you know at this point, there’s no such thing as systems that are universally better than others. Every system and mechanic works (or doesn't work) depending on its game context. One important thing to note, though, is that turn-based systems are less dependent on the implementation of characters’ animations and actions.</p><p class="calibre_2">This means that the designer can better control them through prototyping and simulations, which is a precious advantage. Another interesting thing about turn-based systems is that not only the designers are interested in building models to simulate them. Part of the fun for some players who enjoy these kinds of games is, in fact, to build their own game models and analyze them to find the best strategies.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Combat depth</p><p class="calibre_2">This is going to be valid for games in general, not only for combat systems: what is depth?</p><p class="calibre_2">It is an interesting concept to analyze because depth comes from the dynamics (the interaction of each mechanics) rather than from the mechanics themselves. Depth in games comes from the number of meaningful choices available to the player. I don’t usually look for a formal definition of game design concepts but I love this particular one and I believe it's one of the best.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's analyze it.</p><p class="calibre_2">We have already seen how choices are at the core of every fun game experience. When aiming for depth, it’s a common mistake to think that the more choices available, the more depth the gameplay will have. That, of course, is not true, as, for a choice to be meaningful, it is paramount that the amount of options available is limited.</p><p class="calibre_2">There are moments where giving too many choices becomes the same as not giving any at all. If I am able to attack my enemies with hundreds of different weapons, producing the consistent result of defeating them all, in the same way, all the time...I am not playing a deep game.</p><p class="calibre_2">A deep game is one where I’d need to choose the right weapon for the right scenario. Let's take a shooter game set in a modern combat environment. A grenade or a rocket launcher might produce the same desired effect in a particular scenario. I might have been successful using a heavy machine gun or a well-placed mine or explosive...but it is very unlikely that I would be successful using a light gun with a suppressor or a sniper rifle.</p><p class="calibre_2">If all of these weapons were good enough to achieve my goal...what would be the point in having all those differences in the first place?</p><p class="calibre_2">This is why we talk about meaningful choices. Just choices are not enough to achieve depth.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">How to achieve depth</p><p class="calibre_2">So how to design for depth? The challenge for the game designer here is to design each mechanic with a clear vision of the dynamics they will spark during the gameplay.</p><p class="calibre_2">Specifically for a combat system, we need to look at these aspects:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Controls</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Weapons</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Enemies</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Environment</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">The choices available to the player start with controls. This is particularly true in action games, where the design of the controls (which button does what) is as important as defining the character's actions, weapons, and abilities.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Emergent gameplay</p><p class="calibre_2">Emergent gameplay refers to complex situations in games that emerge from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics. It might be part of the initial vision the designer imagined, the result of an attentive design focused on how emergent gameplay could happen. Or it can be something even the designer did not expect. Usually, good games designed with a clear vision of how emergent gameplay could flourish from the core mechanics end up having both those types of emergent gameplay.</p><p class="calibre_2">Designing mechanics that are disconnected from each other, without any vision as to how they could kickstart emergence, usually results in a chaotic maelstrom of useless mechanics, with no actual ways to interact.</p><p class="calibre_2">A great example of emergent gameplay is the Rocket Jump in Quake. The Rocket Launcher in Quake had a knockback effect that players found useful for extending the height of their jumps. By giving up a bit of health (due to the explosion), they were able to jump much higher and reach better strategic positions. None of the designers probably implemented the rocket launcher knockback effect with this in mind. Nonetheless, players have been using this technique to their advantage and the mechanic itself has influenced many other multiplayer shooters over subsequent years.</p><p class="calibre_2">Of course, this emergent mechanic exists only because Quake had a deep enough system for it to emerge. The Rocket Launcher was a unique weapon to use in particular situations and unlike the others had a knockback effect with every shot. Gaining a good shooting position was an important part of the strategy for winning a game. Jumping was an important factor as well, useful for moving faster and in a nonlinear way. All of this prepared the ground for the emergence of a new way to use the weapon.</p><p class="calibre_2">So, ultimately, depth can be achieved by giving the player different tools to solve problems (or fight her enemies) in different ways. Be warned, though: giving different tools means that even if one might be the best in a specific occasion or scenario...it should never be an optimal strategy for the entire game or for every combat instance.</p><p class="calibre_2">If the Rocket Launcher is clearly the weapon that does the most damage, with the best accuracy and area of effect.. and it even allows me to rocket jump if I want to...why would I bother using the other available weapons at all?</p><p class="calibre_2">An optimal strategy is the opposite of depth. There’s no depth in a game where something is clearly and always better than everything else. For some players it might be fun to find optimal strategies and stick to the best characters or units or weapons...but you can bet they won’t enjoy your game for long. We're talking here of objectively better game elements, not favored ones. There is a huge difference and, in fact, players will most likely stick to their favorite options, but since they won't be optimal strategies, their preference will be constantly challenged by the game. Sometimes difficulty might ramp up just because they deliberately choose to go for their favorite tools, instead of the best ones. Sometimes they could be surprised by how heavily the gameplay might change, just by switching weapon, character, or strategy. This is all great news. Good games empower players to choose their own tools and let them embrace the consequences of their choices.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Depth and complexity</p><p class="calibre_2">We already talked about quality over quantity, but this is so important that it is going to take its own space.</p><p class="calibre_2">Are deep systems also complex?</p><p class="calibre_2">If we think about the simplest system of all, we could say that it is formed by just one basic core mechanic. We also said that depth emerges through the interaction of two or more mechanics. But more mechanics, by definition, make games more complex.</p><p class="calibre_2">It appears that depth and complexity are, in fact, related, but here is the thing: our job as game designers is to achieve the maximum amount of depth with the minimum amount of complexity.</p><p class="calibre_2">A very complex game is likely to offer great depth, and that's why we refer to these games as hardcore games. But hardcore games are difficult to learn and even if many players would love to understand how to play them and overcome their intrinsic complexity, the effort required is too high and they will never do it.</p><p class="calibre_2">Much more challenging is to create the same amount of depth of hardcore games while reducing the complexity to a level that is appealing to as many players as possible. If you analyze the history of every AAA game out there, this is exactly what happened and is still happening. We want our games to be played by all the players out there! Not only the ones that can afford to spend hours just learning the basics.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Reducing complexity</p><p class="calibre_2">If complexity and depth grow together, how can we mitigate the former and favor the latter, then?</p><p class="calibre_2">The implicit complexity of a game system, its rules and core mechanics, can be simplified only to the extent by which they don’t become trivial. This is a fact and there’s little we can do, except try to design them in the most elegant way. Luckily, there is something we can do to reduce complexity without affecting depth:</p><div></div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">User Interface: We're going to talk about UI more in a later chapter. For now, keep in mind that a simple and elegant user interface is the first and most important way to reduce complexity. No one enjoys a screen cluttered with icons and buttons, even the most hardcore player doesn't want to click through ten screens to find what he's looking for. No Skyrim fan ever expected to scroll to an infinite list of text to interact with their inventory. I would argue that the more hardcore a game is, the more its UI should be uber-simplified, so the player can focus on understanding the game more than its UI.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Pace: The pace of the game is a major factor in its complexity. The number of decisions the player has to make (which smells like depth) needs to be reasonably balanced against the time he has to make them. Too little time and the player's brain simply won't be able to process everything at once, resulting in complexity sabotaging depth. This is particularly true whenever the player is asked to make uninformed decisions, choices about things she doesn't really know or understand yet. A classic example is the character creation in RPG games. Deciding the character's class and abilities will have a profound impact on the whole gameplay, so be careful about how many choices the player has to make to create her character and how many of those are definitive for the rest of the game.</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Tutorials: Tutorials are very important to teach players how mechanics work in the game. They can be included at any point in a game when something new is introduced. Clever level design or pacing can allow the player to experiment with the new tools available in a safe way and funnel the player into their correct use.</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">In the next section, we are going to discuss how to teach game mechanics and reduce a game's intrinsic complexity with tutorials.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Teaching game mechanics</p><p class="calibre_2">One of the eternal dilemmas of every game designer is: How do I teach players how to play the game?</p><p class="calibre_2">In the early days of video games, there was a physical instruction manual that players had to read in order to understand how to play a game. Most of them, of course, never bothered and just jumped into the gameplay figuring out that by themselves. That has been the standard for years.</p><p class="calibre_2">With the video game audience growing larger and the medium spreading through more affordable and mainstream technology, the average video gamer is today pretty much anyone. It is therefore impossible to take for granted that he'd be able to learn a game just by immersing himself in it. On the other hand, video games themselves have become quite complex systems. Learning a game such as Doom back in 1993 was a straightforward task: arrows keys to move, Ctrl to fire, Spacebar to use objects. With those controls in mind, all you have to do in the game is to shoot at the monsters and open some doors by activating switches or collecting keys.</p><p class="calibre_2">Of course, other mechanics were distinctive of the game: picking up new weapons, avoiding traps like radioactive and toxic pits. Nothing that needed new teaching to the player, though. Got a new weapon? You still shoot by pressing Ctrl.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's jump 23 years ahead, to the recent Doom game released in 2016 by Bethesda. The brilliant tutorial phase teaches you how to shoot at enemies, interact with objects, use the alternate fire of your weapon, perform Glory Kills, and access and use your Codex and Mission log. And then: accessing and navigating the automap, destroying Gore Nests, climbing on ledges, jumping, and upgrading your weapons and Predator suit.</p><p class="calibre_2">That’s a lot of stuff! And all of it is taught in the first 10 minutes of the game. It follows naturally, that while the original 1993 Doom developers (all hail John and John!) didn’t really need to worry about how to teach their game, our friends at id Software must have put in quite an effort to explain all those mechanics in the recent Doom game.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">How to design a tutorial</p><p class="calibre_2">There is a famous quote from an ancient Chinese philosopher that says:</p><p class="calibre_1">"Tell me and I forget, show me and I may remember, involve me and I learn."</p><p class="calibre_2">This phrase should be a mantra for every game designer working on a tutorial to teach a game mechanic. How many game tutorials have you played that were just a lot of dialogues and instructions, one after the other? And how many times has getting back to a game with such tutorials after a few days required you to go through those dialogues again (or have a look at a guide on the internet)?</p><p class="calibre_2">A tutorial made of just instructions and text is a bad tutorial, especially if it overwhelms the player with a huge amount of information in a quick succession. Remember that the more text the player has to read to learn something about a game, the less he will actually read.</p><p class="calibre_2">So what does that quote mean when talking about game tutorials?</p><p class="calibre_2">Just telling players how something works is never enough. Imagine a tutorial on how to use a shield in Dark Souls without having any shields. The tutorial message “Press Left Ctrl to parry” would be pretty meaningless, since with no shield equipped, by pressing Left Ctrl nothing would really happen. So even if the player knows which key he needs to press to use a shield, chances are that when he eventually comes across one, he wouldn’t remember how to use it.</p><p class="calibre_2">Showing a game mechanic is another classic way to teach how to play.</p><p class="calibre_2">A great example is in the recent Far Cry games. Just before getting into a particular scenario where a new mechanic can be introduced, the game pauses and a series of captioned images are presented to the player explaining how to perform the new mechanic. What is great about the Far Cry tutorials is that those tutorial messages are displayed exactly before a perfect scenario to experiment with the new mechanics is presented to the player. And this is where the Involve me part begins.</p><p class="calibre_2">Explaining what a mechanic is in a context where the player can try it out and experiment with it in a safe way means the player will truly learn it before moving on to the next one. The kind of tutorial you will need for your game is deeply connected to the experience you want to give to your players and their behavior and expectations.</p><p class="calibre_2">Some games are fun because they deliberately don’t have any tutorial, so it’s up to the player to figure out how things work. If that is part of the fun you want to give to your players, by all means, go ahead! Always remember though that not understanding is the most frustrating experience in video gaming, so be careful! We're going to talk about tutorials again, later, in <a href="index_split_353.html#filepos796656"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 12</tt></a>, Accessibility, and have a closer look at how to teach game systems to players.</p><div><div><p class="calibre_1">Tutorials in Free to Play games</p><p class="calibre_2">Special attention should be given to Free to Play games. This is an excellent example of how your business model, game genre, and target audience can deeply influence every aspect of your game design. Unlike premium games, Free to Play games are downloaded for free, so the initial commitment from your players is very low. They can immediately lose interest or decide to move to the next free game within seconds of their decision to try yours.</p><p class="calibre_2">Players who buy premium games have already invested money in those games, so their commitment to the game and attention to what's going on on the screen is immensely higher than what they have for F2P games.</p><p class="calibre_2">This doesn’t mean that premium games tutorials can be poorly designed, but for sure they can be designed with more focus on a variety of elements. On the other hand, F2P games tutorials need to be fun, accessible, interesting and promising all at the same time. Accomplishing this is a very difficult task and an incredible challenge for every game designer. Always keep in mind your audience at every step of your design and be consistent with your design choices.</p><p class="calibre_2">We are going to discuss Free to Play games and what challenges they pose to game designers in <a href="index_split_443.html#filepos1012825"><tt class="calibre5">Chapter 15</tt></a>, Games As a Service.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114">The screenshots used in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only.

This has been probably the most difficult so far. We've been through a lot of concepts, principles, and examples. I suggest you reflect on what you have read before proceeding. Let this chapter settle and go back to any part that you think might be worth re-reading, it's a lot to take on!</p><p class="calibre_2">Our journey started with understanding how it is important to come up with new game mechanics and to transform a vision into a playable experience. We then explained some of the fundamental theories behind game design: how to classify game mechanics, player types, and the fun they enjoy by playing games.</p><p class="calibre_2">We briefly explored the art of teaching a game using tutorials. We approached games as systems of conflicts and studied how to design a combat system and which elements are important to them - specifically, depth and complexity.</p><p class="calibre_2">There has been quite a lot of theory, but as Abraham Lincoln once said, "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the ax". We are now ready to deal with one of the most practical chapters of this book, so let's chop the tree and learn how to implement what we have learned so far through prototyping.</p><div></body></html>
