- en: In this part, you will be introduced to a different perspective for a 2D game
    – the side-on view – for an adventure game in which the player is challenged to
    navigate an interactive environment while trying to find pieces of a “puzzle key”
    that will allow you to gain access to a habitat station. You will gain the knowledge
    to set up a player character with different animation states driven by the new
    Input System. You’ll also learn to define gameplay mechanics relating to the environment
    and level design, as well as code player interactions.

- en: Shooting, included as a player verb specified in the GDD, is implemented with
    the new Unity Pool API, which provides an efficient and native code approach to
    reducing **garbage collection** (**GC**). Introducing a data-driven and extensible
    approach to game architecture using ScriptableObjects will give you the knowledge
    to create flexible and customizable game systems.

- en: This coding-heavy section will have you implementing the systems for the game’s
    core loop, including a spawning system, quest system, and event system. The event
    system will tie code together loosely, following good programming practices (SOLID
    principles). You will complete a quest mission and trigger the final events to
    produce a win condition.
