    Installing Unity*, we explored game engines and took a quick look at four alternative
    game engines to help us appreciate Unity. We looked at the history of Unity and
    how it evolved from one release to the next. In addition, we discovered Unity's
    key capabilities and features. We covered Unity's system requirements for developing
    Unity games and the system requirements for running them. Finally, we downloaded
    and installed Unity.

    menus, and buttons on the interface. Unity is a complex game engine with a lot
    of functionality, so we should expect more components for us to interact with.
    If we break the interface down into separate components, we can examine each one
    independently to gain a thorough understanding of the entire interface.
