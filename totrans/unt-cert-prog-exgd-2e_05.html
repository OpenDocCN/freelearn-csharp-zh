		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Chapter 5</em>: Creating a Shop Scene for Our Game</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will incorporate and extend the scriptable objects that heavily helped make our player and the enemy ships in the previous chapter. We will customize a new shop scene, where we will add new upgrades for the player's ship with the use of scriptable objects.</p>
			<p>We will also look at the common uses of raycasts; if you aren't familiar with them, they're best described as an invisible laser that shoots from one point to another:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – Identifying game objects with a raycast</p>
			<p>When the ray hits a game object with a collider, it can retrieve information about the object, and then we can go a little further and manipulate the object we've hit. For example, we can cast a ray to a game object cube, and the ray will confirm to us that it's a cube. Because we have the cube's reference, we can change its color or scale, or position or destroy it – we can pretty much do whatever we want with it. Here, we will use this raycast system to shoot a point from the camera's position to the button in three-dimensional space when we click or touch the screen.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introducing our shop scripts</li>
				<li>Customizing our shop selection</li>
				<li>Selecting game objects with raycasts</li>
				<li>Adding information to our description panel</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, we will be comfortable with taking a piece of artwork and adding functionality to make it more useful. Scriptable objects are our friends, and we will make more use of them in this chapter – adding properties and values so that each option in our shop can hold sprites, prices, and a description. The shop buttons will be in 3D and selected with our invisible laser (the raycast system).</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Introducing our shop scripts</h1>
			<p>In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker503"/> will make some new scriptable objects, as we did when we created our player's ship settings (health, speed, firepower, and so on). You can refer to the <em class="italic">Introducing our scriptable object </em>(<code>SOActorModel</code>) section of <a href="B18381_02_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Adding and Manipulating Objects</em>, for a reminder of how this is done. Instead of changing our enemy's or player's ships, we will be manipulating the shop's selection of powerups (with a selection grid) to add our own ship upgrades that the player will be able to choose from. These upgrades will then be transferred to the player's ship, which will be visually recognized, and two of the three upgrades will carry out alterations to the gameplay.</p>
			<p>Before we go into further detail, let's refresh our memory on where the shop scripts are within the game framework that we introduced in <em class="italic">Chapter 1, Setting Up and Structuring Our Project</em>.</p>
			<p>The following diagram shows the location of the shop scripts:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.02_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – Killer Wave's UML &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – Killer Wave's UML </p>
			<p>Our three <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>shop scripts (<code>PlayerShipBuild</code>, <code>ShopPiece</code>, and <code>SOShopSelection</code>) connect to each other from where the <code>PlayerShipBuild</code> connects to the main, center <code>GameManager</code> script. In short, each script's responsibility in the shop scene is as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>PlayerShipBuild</code> is the overall function of the shop, including adverts and in-game credit control. This script can be broken down into more scripts, but for the sake of trying to keep our framework to a minimum, it is OK for a demo.</li>
				<li><code>ShopPiece</code> handles the content of the player's ship upgrade selections.</li>
				<li><code>SOShopSelection</code> is a scriptable object that holds the data types that will be used in each selection grid in our shop scene.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's take a look at the scene that we will be creating and start applying shop scripts to it, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>From the <code>Scene</code> folder.</li>
				<li>Double-click on the <code>shop</code> scene.</li>
				<li>Drag and drop the <code>ShopManager</code> prefab from the <code>Assets/Prefab</code>).</li>
				<li>Select <code>0</code>, <code>0</code>, and <code>0</code>.</li>
				<li>If you want<a id="_idIndexMarker505"/> a different-colored background, with <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> still selected in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window, change the <strong class="bold">Clear Flags</strong> property from <strong class="bold">Skybox</strong> to <strong class="bold">Solid Color</strong>.<p class="callout-heading">Information</p><p class="callout">Make sure the camera remains in the same screen ratio we set in <a href="B18381_02_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Adding and Manipulating Objects</em> (that is, 1920 x 1080). Use the following screenshot for reference.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following scene is broken into four sections:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.03_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – Our shop layout&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – Our shop layout</p>
			<p>Looking at the<a id="_idIndexMarker506"/> previous screenshot, let's go through each of the numbered points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Starting with <code>testLevel</code> scene (the scene we have been working on in the previous four chapters).</li>
				<li>At the top left (<strong class="bold">2</strong>), we have a visual representation of the player's ship. We can see what it looks like on our player's ship if they buy an upgrade.</li>
				<li>Below the player's ship (<strong class="bold">3</strong>) is a small rectangle that will display the in-game credit balance.</li>
				<li>At the top right (<strong class="bold">4</strong>), a larger rectangle will hold information about our selected upgrade. It will also contain a button that, if the player has enough credits and/or hasn't purchased the item already, will give them the option to buy an upgrade. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>We can make a start with the selection grid (the shop's row of buttons). To save time, I have provided some template art for this scene because we will be replacing it in the next chapter when we create our own UI. </p>
			<p>To make a start with the first button in our shop's selection grid, we need to go to the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window in the Unity Editor and do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">At the top-right corner of the <code>upgrade</code>, as<a id="_idIndexMarker507"/> shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.04_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4 – Looking for game objects containing the word &quot;upgrade&quot; in the Hierarchy window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – Looking for game objects containing the word "upgrade" in the Hierarchy window</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Now, select the top game object titled <code>UPGRADE_00</code>.<p class="callout-heading">Information</p><p class="callout">Note that the content of the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> window is grayed out, apart from the selected game object in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window in the Unity Editor.

				<li>Click on the round <strong class="bold">x</strong> symbol to the right of the search bar. This will bring our <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> content back and expand the parent game objects for us, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.05_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5 – The children of UPGRADE_00&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5 – The children of UPGRADE_00</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Hold <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>down <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> (or <em class="italic">command</em> on macOS) on your keyboard and select the three game objects:<ul><li><code>sprite</code></li><li><code>itemText</code></li><li><code>SelectionQuad</code></li></ul></li>
				<li>With these three objects selected, select the top-left tick box in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window to make these objects active. The location of the box is shown in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.06_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6 – Show and hide the game objects with the tick box&#13;&#10;"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6 – Show and hide the game objects with the tick box</p>
			<p>Our grid should now show its first selection, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.07_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7 – Our first shop button&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7 – Our first shop button</p>
			<p>Our shop has<a id="_idIndexMarker509"/> started to take form. With the first selection set up, we can now go further by customizing these selections with code in the next section. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Importing and calibrating our sprite game object</h2>
			<p>The game<a id="_idIndexMarker510"/> object <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>that I have labeled <code>sprite</code> will receive and display a ship upgrade image that will be displayed in the selection grid. To understand how this sprite can be displayed correctly, we can view its properties when its game object is selected in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window.</p>
			<p>The <code>sprite</code> game object has a <strong class="bold">Sprite Renderer</strong> component attached to it:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.08_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.8 – The Sprite Renderer component&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8 – The Sprite Renderer component</p>
			<p>I have<a id="_idIndexMarker512"/> grayed<a id="_idIndexMarker513"/> out the <code>sprite</code> game object property is what object type we are going to be supplying the <code>powerup</code> property, which gives us a fire-like icon in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> window. </p>
			<p>Let's check the <code>powerup</code> property so that we are certain of its data type and how it's recognized in the Unity Editor.</p>
			<p>To view the sprite's data type, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">With the <code>sprite</code> game object still selected in our <code>powerup</code> property in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window of the <strong class="bold">Sprite Renderer</strong> section.</li>
				<li>The <code>powerup</code> sprite location will appear in the <code>powerup</code> sprite location pinging when selected from the <strong class="bold">Sprite Renderer</strong> component: </li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.09_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.9 – The location of our 'powerup' sprite in the Project window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.9 – The location of our 'powerup' sprite in the Project window</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Next, click <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>on <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/>the parent of the <code>powerup</code> property in the <code>powerup</code> sprite's import settings.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The majority of the information doesn't require altering, but the main point of focus is making sure that the <strong class="bold">Texture Type</strong> setting is recognized as <strong class="bold">Sprite</strong> to make the file compatible with the <strong class="bold">Sprite Renderer</strong> component.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows our <code>powerup</code> file recognized as a sprite, with an image preview at the bottom of the window:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.10_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.10 – Our 'powerup' file will be set as a Sprite in the Texture Type field&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.10 – Our 'powerup' file will be set as a Sprite in the Texture Type field</p>
			<p>It is possible <a id="_idIndexMarker516"/>that<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> when a sprite, such as a <code>powerup</code> texture in the previous screenshot, is imported into Unity, it may not be recognized as a sprite and will be given the <code>Default</code> type. This is because <code>Default</code> is the most common selection for textures, especially with three-dimensional models. <code>Default</code> also offers more options with regard to texture properties.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Further Information</p>
			<p class="callout">If you want to know more about texture types, check out <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TextureTypes.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TextureTypes.html</a>.</p>
			<p>With regard to our <code>powerup</code> texture, we do not need to change it to <code>Default</code>. When we add another selection, the same principles of checking the image type should be carried out. Let's<a id="_idIndexMarker518"/> now move on to the second game object <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>of the <code>UPGRADE_00</code> game object – <code>itemText</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Displaying credit on our itemText game object</h2>
			<p>The second<a id="_idIndexMarker520"/> child game object from <code>UPGRADE_00</code> is <code>itemText</code>. This game object has a <code>SOLD</code> in the text.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the connection between the <strong class="bold">Text Mesh</strong> component and the text in the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> window:  </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.11_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.11 – Text Mesh text set to '0000'&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.11 – Text Mesh text set to '0000'</p>
			<p>Let's now move on to the final child game object of the <code>UPGRADE_00</code> hierarchy, which is <code>SelectionQuad</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Project file diagnosis when making SelectionQuad</h2>
			<p>In this section, I am going to briefly explain how the shop's selection grid is prepared.</p>
			<p><code>SelectionQuad</code> is the third child game object of the <code>UPGRADE_00</code> game object, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.12_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.12 – The SelectionQuad game object in the Hierarchy window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.12 – The SelectionQuad game object in the Hierarchy window</p>
			<p>This game object <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>simply serves to show the player that they have made a selection. It consists of a quad mesh, which is a standard primitive that can be made in Unity (by right-clicking in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window and selecting <strong class="bold">3D Object | Quad</strong>). We are now going to change its appearance to make it look more interesting by manipulating its material values; follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Once the <code>Quad</code> object is moved into position, change its <strong class="bold">Material</strong> properties from an <strong class="bold">Opaque</strong> rendering mode to <strong class="bold">Transparent</strong> (<strong class="bold">1</strong>).</li>
				<li>Then, click on the <code>64</code>, <code>152</code>, <code>255</code>, and <code>140</code>. The following screenshot shows the color property changes made to the <code>SelectionQuad</code> material:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.13_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.13 – Rendering Mode set to Transparent and the RGBA values modified to a light blue color&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.13 – Rendering Mode set to Transparent and the RGBA values modified to a light blue color</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">That is the<a id="_idIndexMarker522"/> entirety of our <code>UPGRADE_00</code> selection. Then, copy and paste each game object onto two more black rectangles and rename them <code>UPGRADE_01</code> and <code>UPGRADE_02</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the three game objects:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.14_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.14 – Duplicating the game objects&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.14 – Duplicating the game objects</p>
			<p>For the purpose of this chapter, we are going to be using these three game objects to manipulate and carry information from one scene to another. Before we start making scripts for these selections, I want to show you some text that will be added to the two slightly larger buttons at the far right of the grid:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Scroll down in the <code>WATCH AD</code> and <code>START</code>. These two game objects will hold the following responsibilities:<ul><li><code>WATCH AD</code> is used when the player selects this button; an advert will play. Once the advert is finished, the player is rewarded with credits. These credits can be used to buy more upgrades.</li><li><code>START</code> is used when the player is finished with the shop. They can move on by pressing the <strong class="bold">START</strong> button.</li></ul></li>
				<li>Expand <code>WATCH AD</code> and <code>START</code> by clicking on each arrow to the left of them.</li>
				<li>Click on<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> each game object and make them active in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window, as we did earlier in the <em class="italic">Introducing our shop scripts</em> section.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In each expanded game object, we have a label game object; this holds a <strong class="bold">Text Mesh</strong> component, which we have been introduced to already in this section, that displays our button text.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the expanded <code>WATCH AD</code> and <code>START</code> objects in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.15_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.15 – The WATCH AD and START button locations&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.15 – The WATCH AD and START button locations</p>
			<p>So far, we understand that we have a shop scene that will contain scriptable objects for our ship's upgrades; we are also aware of how the option to watch adverts to gain credits is a popular mechanism with free-to-play games.</p>
			<p>That is all that<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> we need for the selection grid. We can now start considering how to turn the buttons on and off, change each upgrade art, and more in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Customizing our shop selection</h1>
			<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>are going to use scriptable objects to customize each selection. We have already used scriptable objects in <a href="B18381_02_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Adding and Manipulating Objects</em>. This time, we will use a similar method but for our selection grid; hopefully, this will make you appreciate how scriptable objects can be expanded and used across the game.</p>
			<p>As mentioned in <a href="B18381_02_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Adding and Manipulating Objects</em>, I make a habit of initialing scriptable objects with an <code>SO</code> prefix so that they're easy to identify. Let's create an <code>SOShopSelection</code> script:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the Unity Editor, go to the <code>Assets/Script</code>.</li>
				<li>Create a script (using the same method from <a href="B18381_02_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">,</em> <em class="italic">Adding and Manipulating Objects</em>) and name it <code>SOShopSelection</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This <code>SOShopSelection</code> script will create a template of data types for our asset files (the same as with our player and enemy ships). These asset files will be attached to each of the player ship upgrades.</p>
			<p>An individual selection from the grid will take four property types, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>icon</code>: A picture of the selection.</li>
				<li><code>iconName</code>: Identifies what the selection is.</li>
				<li><code>description</code>: Used to describe what the upgrade is in the large selection box at the top right of the scene.</li>
				<li><code>cost</code>: Calculates how many credits it is worth so that it can be displayed in the credit values of the selection.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's open the <code>SOShopSelection</code> script and begin to code:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">At the top of the script, make sure that we have imported the following library:<pre><strong class="bold">using UnityEngine;</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As with most scripts in Unity, we need the <code>UnityEngine</code> library so that we can use the <code>ScriptableObject</code> functionality.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">To make it <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>so that we can create assets from the scriptable object, we enter the following attribute above our class name:<pre><strong class="bold">[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "Create Shop Piece", menuName = </strong>
<strong class="bold">   "Create Shop Piece")]</strong></pre></li>
				<li>Enter the following code to inherit <code>ScriptableObject</code> to the <code>SOShopSelection</code> script. This will give us the functionality for creating template asset files:<pre><strong class="bold">public class SOShopSelection : ScriptableObject</strong>
<strong class="bold">{</strong></pre></li>
				<li>Enter the following code to hold the specific variables:<pre>  public Sprite icon;
  public string iconName;
  public string description;
  public string cost;
}</pre></li>
				<li>Save the script.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We have made the script to hold our data for each potential selection in the grid. As mentioned, we have already made these types of scripts before – we are just using them here to customize buttons, rather than spaceships.</p>
			<p>We can now<a id="_idIndexMarker527"/> customize our three <code>UPGRADE</code> game objects in the Unity Editor – let's do that next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Creating selection templates</h2>
			<p>In the last <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>section, we made a scriptable object<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> that allowed us to create an asset file that holds custom parameters and values. These assets and their properties can be created by users who don't hold programming knowledge, which is ideal for designers and programmers.</p>
			<p>We have three selections to add to our selection grid:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Weapon upgrade</strong>: Gives the player's ship a stronger weapon</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Health upgrade</strong>: Allows the player's ship to get hit twice by an enemy object</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Atom bomb</strong>: Wipes all the visible enemies out</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So, let's go back to the Unity Editor and make some asset templates for our selection grid:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">From the <code>Assets/ScriptableObject</code>.</li>
				<li>Right-click in an open space of the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window, and from the dropdown that appears, select <strong class="bold">Create</strong> and then <strong class="bold">Create Shop Piece</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.16_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.16 – Creating a 'Shop Piece'&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.16 – Creating a 'Shop Piece'</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Rename the new <code>Create Shop Piece</code> file <code>Shot_PowerUp</code>.</li>
				<li>With <code>Shot_PowerUp</code> still selected, navigate to the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window, where we have the data types that we can enter.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the <code>Shot_PowerUp</code> properties that we are going<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> to<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> change next:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.17_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.17 – The Shot_PowerUp properties&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p>We have made the scriptable objects and configured them for our ship's upgrades. Let's now make the second main script for the shop, <code>ShopPiece</code>. This script will hold each of the asset files <a id="_idIndexMarker534"/>we have just made and display <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>their content around the shop's grid scene.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Customizing our player ship's upgrade selection</h2>
			<p>The purpose<a id="_idIndexMarker536"/> of this script is to<a id="_idIndexMarker537"/> send information to each of the selection buttons in our shop scene. For each of the three <code>UPGRADE</code> game objects, we will create and attach a script that takes reference from the <code>SOShopSelection</code> scriptable object (the three asset files we made in the previous section) and assign them to each player ship's upgrade button. </p>
			<p>To create the <code>ShopPiece</code> script, do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Let's start by navigating to <code>Assets/Script</code> from the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> window.</li>
				<li>Create the script the same way as we did at the start of the <em class="italic">Customizing our shop selection</em> section and name the script <code>ShopPiece</code>.</li>
				<li>Open the script and begin to code, starting with the script that contains the <code>UnityEngine</code> library at the top of the script:<pre><strong class="bold">using UnityEngine;</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Because we are using elements of Unity and attaching the <code>ShopPiece</code> script with the Unity Editor, this script will require the <code>UnityEngine</code> library.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Check and enter the following code to declare the class name and inheritance:<pre><strong class="bold">public class ShopPiece : MonoBehaviour </strong>
<strong class="bold">{</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>By default, our script should be automatically named, with <code>Monobehaviour</code> inherited.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Enter the<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> following <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>code to allow the <code>shopSelection</code> instance to be updated:<pre>[SerializeField]
  SOShopSelection shopSelection;
  public SOShopSelection ShopSelection
  {
    get {return shopSelection; }
    set {shopSelection = value; }
  }</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We add a reference to the <code>SOShopSelection</code> script that we made in the last section. This reference is private (because it isn't labeled as <code>public</code>), but we expose it to the Unity Editor with a <code>[SerializeField]</code> function above it. This means that we can drag and drop each scriptable asset file to its field in the Unity Editor. If another script requires access to the private <code>shopSelection</code> variable, we can refer to the <code>ShopSelection</code> property that will receive and send its data (<code>get</code> and <code>set</code>).</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Enter the following code to update the <code>shopSelection</code> sprite:<pre>void Awake()
  {
   //icon slot
   if (GetComponentInChildren&lt;SpriteRenderer&gt;() != null)
  {
   GetComponentInChildren&lt;SpriteRenderer&gt;().sprite = 
     shopSelection.icon;
  }</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>When this script is active and runs for the first time, it runs its <code>Awake</code> function. Inside the <a id="_idIndexMarker540"/>function <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>are two <code>if</code> statements; the first checks whether there is a <code>SpriteRenderer</code> component in any of its child game objects. If there is, then it grabs a reference from its <code>shopSelection</code> asset file and applies its icon sprite to display on the button. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">Enter the following code to update the cost value:<pre>   //selection value
    if(transform.Find("itemText"))
    {
      GetComponentInChildren&lt;TextMesh&gt;().text =     shopSelection.cost;
    }
  }</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The alternative <code>if</code> statement checks whether any of the child game objects of this class have a game object titled <code>itemText</code>. </p>
			<p>If there is a game object titled <code>itemText</code>, we update its <code>TextMesh</code> component's <code>text</code> value with the <code>shopSelection</code> cost value.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">Save the script.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Back in the Unity Editor, we can attach the <code>ShopPiece</code> script, along with each asset script we made in the last section.</p>
			<p>To attach <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/>each <code>ShopPiece</code> script <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>to each <code>UPGRADE</code> game object file, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">From the <code>UPGRADE_00</code> game object.</li>
				<li>Either drag and drop the <code>ShopPiece</code> script from the <code>Assets /Script</code>) or click on <strong class="bold">Add Component</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window and type the script's name in the drop-down search.</li>
				<li><code>UPGRADE_00</code> will be our weapon powerup button, so for the <code>Assets /ScriptableObject</code>) or click on the small circle to the right of the <code>Shot_PowerUp</code>. Use the following screenshot as a reference to see how your <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window should look:</li>

			<p>If you recall, our asset files have names and description data; we can use this for the large rectangle in the shop scene when it comes to supplying information about the item. Also, we<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> need to update the<a id="_idIndexMarker547"/> player ship's visuals to show what a purchase looks like on the ship, as well as a few other things. In the next section, we are going to create a script that allows the player to press a button from the selection grid.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Selecting game objects with raycasts</h1>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker548"/>section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> are going to create the final shop script, <code>PlayerShipBuild</code>. This script holds properties such as selecting any button from the selection grid, running adverts, communicating with our existing game framework scripts, launching our game to play, and a few other things that we will cover.</p>
			<p>One of the subjects you will likely come across in your Unity programmer exam and when developing games/applications in Unity is shooting invisible lasers, which are used for things such as shooting a gun, making a selection in three-dimensional space, and more. In this section, we are going to make a button on the selection grid light up blue when the player presses on it to let them know that it has been selected. We already have each of our buttons set up with blue rectangles that are permanently on. So, all that we need to do now is turn them all off when the scene becomes active and make any of the buttons turn on when a ray (invisible laser) comes into contact with them.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows an example of how the player sees the selection screen (<strong class="bold">SELECTION 2D</strong>) and the same scene at an angle so that we can see the main camera's clipping planes (<strong class="bold">SELECTION 3D</strong>). When the player presses a button on the selection grid, an invisible line (ray) will travel across it. If the line comes into contact with a game <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>object that has a collider attached to it, we<a id="_idIndexMarker551"/> can get information from that game object:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.25_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.25 – Shooting a ray from our camera position to select a button in the shop&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.25 – Shooting a ray from our camera position to select a button in the shop</p>
			<p>So, what we are going to do for this selection is start creating a <code>PlayerShipBuild</code> script and give it the functionality to shoot rays, which will then change the color of the button.</p>
			<p>Let's start by creating a script in the usual <code>Assets/Script</code>) and naming it <code>PlayerShipBuild</code>. You should know how to make a script now, as we did so in the previous <em class="italic">Customizing our player ship's upgrade selection</em> section.</p>
			<p>To create a raycast selection, open the <code>PlayerShipBuild</code> script and follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">By default, we require the UnityEngine library, as previously mentioned:<pre><strong class="bold">using UnityEngine;</strong></pre></li>
				<li>Enter the following code to declare our class:<pre><strong class="bold">public class PlayerShipBuild : MonoBehaviour </strong>
<strong class="bold">{</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Our script has a <code>public</code> access modifier and is named the same as the <code>PlayerShipBuild</code> file.</p>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker552"/>script <a id="_idIndexMarker553"/>inherits <code>MonoBehaviour</code>, so it is recognized when attached to a game object in the Editor. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Enter the following code to hold each of the <code>shopButtons</code>:<pre><strong class="bold">  [SerializeField]</strong>
<strong class="bold">  GameObject[] shopButtons;</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We have a <code>private</code> variable that is exposed in the Editor with <code>[SerializeField]</code> (so we can see and edit it), which will hold an array of all 10 game object buttons on the selection grid.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Enter the following code to hold two game objects for raycasting:<pre><strong class="bold">  GameObject target;</strong>
<strong class="bold">  GameObject tmpSelection;</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <code>tmpSelection</code> variable is used to store the raycast selection so that we can check to see what we have made contact with. The target variable will be used later on in the script.</p>
			<p><code>tmpSelection</code> will be used at the end of the selection process when it comes to turning the game object on. </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Enter the following code within the <code>Start</code> function to run our method:<pre><strong class="bold">  void Start()</strong>
<strong class="bold">  {</strong>
<strong class="bold">    TurnOffSelectionHighlights();</strong>
<strong class="bold">  }</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Unity's <code>Start</code> function will be the first thing called when this script becomes active.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Next, we <a id="_idIndexMarker554"/>will <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>enter the following code to create the <code>TurnOffSelectionHighlights</code> method:<pre>  void TurnOffSelectionHighlights()
  {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; shopButtons.Length; i++)
    {
      shopButtons[i].SetActive(false);
    }
  }</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Within the <code>TurnOffSelectionHighlights</code> method, we run a <code>for</code> loop that makes sure all of the buttons have their blue rectangles turned off.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">Enter the following code into the <code>Update</code> function that is called at every frame:<pre>  void Update()
  {
    AttemptSelection();
  }</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <code>AttemptSelection</code> method is responsible for receiving the player's input for a button selection. The content of this method will be covered in detail when we come to it.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">Enter the following<a id="_idIndexMarker556"/> code<a id="_idIndexMarker557"/> to create our <code>ReturnClickedObject</code> method:<pre>  GameObject ReturnClickedObject (out RaycastHit hit)
  {
    GameObject target = null;
    Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay (Input.mousePosition);
    if (Physics.Raycast (ray.origin, ray.direction * 100, out hit)) 
    {
      target = hit.collider.gameObject;
    }
    return target;
  }</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <code>ReturnClickedObject</code> method also takes an argument of an <code>out</code> raycast hit, which will contain information of what collider the ray has made contact with.</p>
			<p>Within this method, we reset the <code>target</code> game object to remove any previous data. We then take reference from the camera to find where the player tapped or clicked their mouse on the screen and store the result in the form of a ray.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Further Information</p>
			<p class="callout">More information about <code>ScreenPointToRay</code> can be found in Unity's scripting reference at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera.ScreenPointToRay.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera.ScreenPointToRay.html</a>.</p>
			<p>We then check whether the origin and the direction of the camera from where we have shot the ray have made contact with a collider (within 100 world space meters).</p>
			<p>If we have made contact with a collider, the <code>if</code> statement is acknowledged as <code>true</code>; we then take the reference of the game object it has hit and store it in the <code>target</code> game object.</p>
			<p>Finally, we send out (<code>return</code>) the <code>target</code> game object that the ray has come into contact with.</p>
			<p>If you<a id="_idIndexMarker558"/> recall, we <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>referred to an <code>AttemptSelection</code> method earlier in the <code>Update</code> function. The <code>AttemptSelection</code> method will check whether a condition is made when the player has made contact by tapping the screen or clicking a mouse button in our shop scene.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="9">Enter the following code to write out the <code>AttemptSelection</code> method:<pre>void AttemptSelection()
{
    if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown (0)) 
    {
      RaycastHit hitInfo;
      target = ReturnClickedObject (out hitInfo);
      if (target != null)
      {
        if (target.transform.Find("itemText"))
        { 
          TurnOffSelectionHighlights();
          Select();
        }
      }
    }
 }</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>If the player has pressed the mouse button or tapped the touchscreen, we will fire the ray and send all <code>RaycastHit</code> objects into the <code>ReturnClickedObject</code> method that we mentioned in the previous section of code. The results from the <code>ReturnClickedObject</code> method are returned to the <code>target</code> game object that we made at the start of the script.</p>
			<p>We then <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>check <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>whether this <code>target</code> game object exists. If it does exist, we then run another check to see whether this <code>target</code> game object is holding a game object named <code>itemText</code>. If it does have a game object with this name, we refresh the selection grid by turning all the blue quads off, followed by a method called <code>Select</code>, which is what we are going to talk about next.</p>
			<p>We have finally dug down into the last bit of our script where we find the name of the <code>SelectionQuad</code> game object and turn it on to give the player visual feedback of what selection they have made.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="10">Enter the following method into our code; this will make the player's button selection active:<pre>  void Select()
  {
    tmpSelection =  target.transform.Find
       ("SelectionQuad").gameObject;
    tmpSelection.SetActive(true);
  }</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <code>Select</code> method doesn't need to check any conditions with <code>if</code> statements, as this has mostly been done for us with the previous code. We will carry out a search for <code>SelectionQuad</code> and store its reference as <code>tmpSelection</code>.</p>
			<p>Finally, we set the <code>tmpSelection</code> game object's activity to <code>true</code> so that it is seen in our <code>shop</code> <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> window.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="11">Save<a id="_idIndexMarker562"/> the <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>script and return to the Unity Editor.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can now attach our <code>PlayerShipBuild</code> script to our shop game object (using the same attaching method we used earlier in this chapter for <code>ShopPiece</code>), which is the parent to all of the buttons in the selection grid, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.26_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.26 – Our 'shop' containing the 'Player Ship Build' script and the amount of 'Shop Buttons' highlighted (0)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.26 – Our 'shop' containing the 'Player Ship Build' script and the amount of 'Shop Buttons' highlighted (0)</p>
			<p>Also, if you recall at the start of the <code>PlayerShipBuild</code> script, we added a game object variable that would take an array of <code>shopButtons</code>. We could have a <code>for</code> loop to add each <code>UPGRADE</code> game object automatically at the start of the script, but if, in the future, we wanted to consider using a joypad or keyboard to guide us through the selection grid, we would have more control over knowing which button is assigned to each array number. Also, this is just another way of programming without relying on code, as Unity is a component-based engine. Other controller inputs and interactions are something we are going to cover in <a href="B18381_13_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Effects, Testing, Performance, and Alt Controls</em>, where we will start thinking about other platforms to port our game to.</p>
			<p>With<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> the<a id="_idIndexMarker565"/> potential of updating our controls in a later lesson, here is how you should attach the game objects to the <code>shopButtons</code> array in the Unity Editor:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="12">With the shop game object still selected in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window, it's probably best to lock the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window at this point (as we did in <a href="B18381_04_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor087"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Applying Art, Animation, and Particles</em>), as we are going to be selecting and dragging different game objects.</li>
				<li>Change the shop button's size from <code>0</code> to <code>10</code> in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We will now get a burst of empty game object fields in the <code>SelectionQuad</code> game object to each field.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="14">Next, to make things even easier, click on the arrow to the left of each game object under the shop game object to expand each of the child game objects. This will uncover the <code>SelectionQuad</code> game objects that we need to drag across.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window with a list of empty game objects and the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window game objects expanded out:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.27_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.27 – Drag and drop each SelectionQuad game object from the Hierarchy window into the correct fields in the Inspector window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.27 – Drag and drop each SelectionQuad game object from the Hierarchy window into the correct fields in the Inspector window</p>
			<p>We have <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>also<a id="_idIndexMarker567"/> added arrow stripes to the previous screenshot to show which <code>SelectionQuad</code> objects need to go into which game object field in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="15">Save the scene. If you locked your <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window, don't forget to unlock it.</li>
				<li>Press the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button in the Editor.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, when the scene starts, all the blue selection quads disappear, but if you click on any one, it will light up, depending on which button is pressed.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the atom bomb button selected when the mouse clicks on it in the game window. This will also work with touchscreen devices:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.28_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.28 – The Atom Bomb button selected&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.28 – The Atom Bomb button selected</p>
			<p>That covers using raycasts, which is a transferable skill and can be used for anything that involves shooting to grab information from another game object, providing it has a collider attached to it.</p>
			<p>Let's now move on to updating the description panel so that when a selection is made from the grid, we <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/>get the text on the large, dark rectangle<a id="_idIndexMarker569"/> with information we stored from the same scriptable objects that give information to each player upgrade button.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Adding information to our description panel</h1>
			<p>When a selection<a id="_idIndexMarker570"/> is made in the shop scene, we can take the information from the selection's scriptable object asset file and display its details within its <code>textBoxPanel</code> game object.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at the <code>textBoxPanel</code> object in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.29_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.29 – Our 'textBoxPanel' content in the Hierarchy window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.29 – Our 'textBoxPanel' content in the Hierarchy window</p>
			<p>The <code>textBoxPanel</code> game object holds a black quad that is used for its background. It also holds four other <a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>game objects, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>name</code>: This game object <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>contains a <code>iconName</code> scriptable object variable.</li>
				<li><code>desc</code>: This game object also holds a <code>description</code> scriptable object variable.</li>
				<li><code>backPanel</code>: This game object serves as a background for the selection grid.</li>
				<li><code>BUY?</code>: This game object will be covered later on when we want to confirm that we want to purchase the item we have selected.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following screenshot identifies the two scriptable object data types from the <code>Health_Level1</code> asset file that we made earlier in this chapter. The information on this large rectangle will change, depending on which button is selected:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.30_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.30 – A description of the button selected in the rectangle box&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.30 – A description of the button selected in the rectangle box</p>
			<p>Let's now go back to the <code>PlayerShipBuild</code> script and add some more code to update the<a id="_idIndexMarker573"/> description panel (the <code>textBoxPanel</code> game object):</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Reopen the <code>PlayerShipBuild</code> script and add the following variable to the top of the script with the other variables:<pre><strong class="bold">GameObject textBoxPanel;</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This game object variable will hold a reference to the <code>textBoxPanel</code> game object in our scene. Next, we need to grab and refer to this game object from our <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Scroll down to the <code>Start</code> function and enter the following line of code to store the <code>textBoxPanel</code> game object as a reference:<pre>textBoxPanel = GameObject.Find("textBoxPanel");</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, scroll down to the content of <code>AttemptSelection</code>.  </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Scroll down until we get to the following <code>if</code> statement and add <code>UpdateDescriptionBox();</code> to the content of that statement:<pre>        if (target.transform.Find("itemText"))
        { 
          TurnOffSelectionHighlights();
          Select();
          UpdateDescriptionBox();
        }        </pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <code>UpdateDescriptionBox</code> method will grab the selected button's two assets. These <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>asserts (<code>iconName</code> and <code>description)</code> are then applied to each <code>TextMesh</code> <code>text</code> component of <code>textboxPanel</code>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Let's now enter the content of this method with the following code:<pre>void UpdateDescriptionBox()
{
               textBoxPanel.transform.Find("name").gameObject.GetComponent
   &lt;TextMesh&gt;().text = tmpSelection.GetComponentInParent
      &lt;ShopPiece&gt;().ShopSelection.iconName;
    textBoxPanel.transform.Find("desc").gameObject.GetComponent
   &lt;TextMesh&gt;().text = tmpSelection.GetComponentInParent
      &lt;ShopPiece&gt;().ShopSelection.description;
 }</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <code>UpdateDescriptionBox</code> method will get the reference name and description from the shop button that's selected and will apply the string values to the shop's black noticeboard ( <code>textBoxPanel</code>).</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Save the script.</li>
				<li>Test the results by pressing <strong class="bold">Play</strong> in the Unity Editor.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following<a id="_idIndexMarker575"/> screenshot shows the first selection grid being selected with the description panel details displayed:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.31_B18381.jpg" alt="Figure 5.31 – The description displayed for selecting the 'Blast Shot' weapon&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.31 – The description displayed for selecting the 'Blast Shot' weapon</p>
			<p>With a small amount of code, the description panel lights up and displays information from any of the items that are selected. This is useful, as if we ever wanted to extend the selection grid with more items, we wouldn't need to bloat our code to compensate for each selection.</p>
			<p>We now have a shop scene that shows what is available to buy and descriptions of what each item is. Let's<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> summarize what we have learned in this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we started creating a shop scene that holds various buttons and panels created from three-dimensional polygons. We then created our own script to fill the scene with images, values, names, and descriptions of assets that can potentially be purchased with virtual credits.</p>
			<p>We also made use of scriptable objects to create a template for our code so that it can be topped up with various in-game powerups without inflating our game's framework. We also made it interchangeable, so if a weapon needs changing, replacing, or removing, we can simply remove the template without affecting the rest of the code in our game framework.</p>
			<p>The other lesson we learned in this chapter is being aware that we can create games that are free to download but also knowing how to create a form of income with a monetization game design to create revenue.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will continue with our shop scene and focus more on the content of each button and the overall functionality of our shop by adding content to our player's ship. We will also look at game advertisements as a form of currency for the player to upgrade their spaceship.</p>
