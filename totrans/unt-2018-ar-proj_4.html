<p>In this chapter, we will design and create our first AR application with macOS and utilize ARKit. This will be an application that utilizes a touch sensor and camera sensors in tandem to initiate sound clips from various literary sources. This will serve as a fantastic introduction to programming and setting up Unity to work with the AR tools available to us. This will also allow us to utilize the built-in functions provided for using the camera sensor and the touch sensor.<br/>
<br/>
In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conceptualizing the project</li>
<li>Setting up the Unity project</li>
<li>Code implementation details</li>
<li>Working with XCode</li>

<p>Before building any game or application, it should always be a first step to know exactly what you want to build. You don’t have to know the exact implementation details, just what you want to build and how you want to go about building it. This should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic idea/concept</li>
<li>Programming language to use</li>
<li>Platform to release on</li>
<li>Game engine or libraries/frameworks to use</li>
<li>Design document/design outline</li>
<li>Written or code implementation prototype for proof of concept</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, why are these points so important? They are important because it helps solidify the idea, gives a clear path for what you want to accomplish, and most importantly, proves that the project is possible to build. Let’s dive into each point and use them to build our first AR application.</p>

            <article>
                
<div>
<p>The basic idea or concept of an application or game should not be any more than a paragraph explaining what you want to create. It isn’t meant to explain the full features or everything you want that to be in the application or game. Rather, it is only meant as a basic starting point that says that this is the overall idea that you want to work on.</p>
<p>This is important because it is the core of the application or game idea, and you can define what the main features of the app or game are and give a clear point of reference for researching.</p>
<p>Our basic concept is to be able to select anywhere in the video feed of the camera and it will read a random passage from a poem or book based on the lighting of the area. Now, this doesn’t go too much into depth on what the application will do, but we can use this as the basis for the fourth step to expand upon the basic idea to create a fully functional and detailed explanation of the application.</p>

            <article>
                
<div>
<p>This choice is not always obvious when developing an application or a game. While your own knowledge does play a major role in choosing the language to use, so do the requirements of the application or game and your team’s knowledge. This step should be done in tandem with the next step before finalizing the decision, as your research may determine that the language that you prefer doesn’t have the proper libraries or capabilities for developing the particular game or application you want.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, our example will be using C#.</p>

<p>This one is rather straightforward. Do you want to release on Android, iOS, Windows, or some other platform?  This will determine which language to select to use as well as which game engine or libraries/frameworks we need – which leads us to the next section.</p>

            <article>
                
<div>
<p>As stated previously, this step should be done in tandem with the previous steps as they are intrinsically tied together. This step requires you to do in-depth and highly detailed research into what you wrote for the basic idea/concept. Not only are you looking to see if what you want to do is possible, but also whether or not the language, game engine, or library/ framework you want to use supports it. This also requires you to know which platform you want to release on.<br/>
With the basic idea of this application, we know that it would require utilizing the camera and having touch events to detect whether something is lit well enough or not to determine whether or not it should play the audio file.</p>

<p>The design document is more of a design specification document that describes the application in its entirety. That means that all of the data-, architectural-, interface-, and component-level design is described for it. The following example showcases how the documentation would look. You can download a copy of the template from <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc7e17.doc?id=18632">http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc7e17.doc?id=18632</a>:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Technical design template</div>
<div>
<p>For game design, the design document can be a bit more involved than it is for applications. A typical game design document will require the sections described to be filled out in as much detail as possible. You can download a copy of the template from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-I08qX76DgSFyN1ByIGtPuqXh7bVKraHcNIA25tpAzE/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-I08qX76DgSFyN1ByIGtPuqXh7bVKraHcNIA25tpAzE/edit</a>:</p>

<div>
<p>Now, you might be thinking that this is a lot of work for applications or games. The key to success is never wrought from laziness or pure luck. In creating documentation that has as much depth as this, you are ensuring that you know exactly what you need to do and why you need to do it, and if you bring on team members, they will be able to read the document and fully understand your goals and intentions with little input from you.</p>
<p>This also means that you can keep yourself firmly in line with the project, forcing you not to add little pet features except as extra milestones after the project has reached the completion mark.</p>

<p><strong><span>Unified Modeling Language</span></strong> (<strong><span>UML</span></strong>) is a great way for visualizing the design of your application or game. NClass is a free UML editor that you can download and use.</p>
<p>You can preplan all of your methods, attributes, properties, classes, and enums – pretty much everything related to programming – with UML. UML really helps for the next phase, which is actually to implement the prototype:</p>

<p>Now, our proof of concept will actually be the full project, although for your own projects in the future, run a small-scale implementation to make sure the features that are 100% necessary are able to be implemented and work appropriately.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that, if for any reason you are unable to implement the main feature of the app or game, you haven’t wasted as much time or money on the project as you would have done by implementing on a larger scale.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The very first thing we are going to do is set Unity up on our Mac computer to be able to create our project. Since we know we will need ARKit, which only works on macOS, we will have different projects for the different chapters, as we don’t want any compilation issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let’s create a new project, and we will call it <kbd>Chapter4</kbd> or <kbd>Sound of Flowery Prose</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2895fa74-0261-4334-b594-178fb6f9e9a1.png"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Next up, we need to click on the store and search for ARKit to download and add it to our project:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/be5d09b1-cff2-4e0c-8a8a-be69c847a492.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>I am a bit of a stickler for organization, so we have to make sure to set up all the empty game objects we need to keep things organized. So, we will have four empty game objects called <kbd>CameraParent</kbd>, <kbd>ARKitControl</kbd>, <kbd>ARCameraManager</kbd>, and <kbd>HitCubeParent</kbd>. Your project should look like the one in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7770fba0-9342-4566-8dbd-83b723056d6b.png" style="width:15.50em;height:10.83em;"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Drag the camera into the <kbd>CameraParent</kbd> empty game object:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/54949066-801d-4c77-816a-24ed79ea76e5.png" style="width:15.83em;height:12.75em;"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Create a <kbd>Cube</kbd> and drag the <kbd>Cube</kbd> into the <kbd>HitCubeParent</kbd> object:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><br/>
<img src="assets/06a111dd-30b1-4af7-8005-fba19ff87c25.png" style="width:14.75em;height:12.83em;"/></div>
<p>Now that we have Unity basically set up as required, we can move on to creating and attaching the scripts we need for the project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Camera</span> component – we have two scripts we need to add to it. The first script is <span class="packt_screen">Unity AR Camera Near-Far</span>, and the second is <span class="packt_screen">Unity AR Video</span>.</li>
<li> <span>The</span> <span class="packt_screen">Unity AR Video</span> <span>also needs a clear material, so let’s set that to be <kbd>YUVMaterial</kbd>:</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><br/>
<img src="assets/2f596d7e-5dac-4788-8994-5d1ce920f470.png" style="width:18.58em;height:42.58em;"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li><kbd>ARCameraManager</kbd> needs the appropriate script attached to it – in this case, it is called the <span class="packt_screen">Unity AR Camera Manager</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9aa20bbb-8710-46e0-bdb4-7dfc25a72516.png"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li><kbd>ARKitControl</kbd> also needs a script attached to it, and it is called <span class="packt_screen">Unity AR Kit Control</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7f98587a-bb2c-4d96-9902-64877d31ff92.png"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>The final thing we need to do is set up our <kbd>Cube</kbd> from inside the <kbd>HitCubeParent</kbd> object to have a brand new script created for it.</li>
<li>Click on the <kbd>Cube</kbd> object and select <span class="packt_screen">Add Component</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Script</span> | <span class="packt_screen">New Script</span>. The name should be <kbd>ARHitCube</kbd>:</li>
</ol>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Code implementation details</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Obviously, the most important part of any project is actually to implement what we want to accomplish. We want this project to play a literary quote from a list of audio samples <span>automatically</span>. To do this, we need an audio source and audio clips. We also want this project to take advantage of ARKit to run, so we need to write a C# class that utilizes features from the ARKit plugin that is exposed from the Objective-C and C++ libraries.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Let’s open up the <kbd>ARHitCube</kbd> class, fill in the details, and explain what is happening at the same time. I should note that very similar code is already provided in the script file called <kbd>UnityARHitTestExample</kbd>; I created this script to be able to show only what is needed and to be able to explain the workflow/thoughts necessary for creating the functionality we need:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">using System;<br/>using System.Collections.Generic;</pre>
<ol>
<li>As per usual, we will only call the specific namespaces we need for our project. In this case, it is <kbd>System</kbd> and <kbd>System.Collections.Generic</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">namespace UnityEngine.XR.iOS</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Our namespace will be used to organize our code to make sure it stays separate from ARKit and Unity’s API, which will avoid naming collisions:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">public class UnityARHitTestExample : MonoBehaviour<br/>{<br/>            public Transform m_HitTransform;<br/>            public AudioClip[] clips;<br/>            public AudioSource source;</pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Our class will inherit from <kbd>MonoBehavior</kbd>, as we want to be able to use it directly from the object (as well as make sure it can be attached to the game object).</li>
<li>We create a public transform to allow us to track locations and a public array of audio clips more easily:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">bool HitTestWithResultType (ARPoint point, ARHitTestResultType resultTypes)<br/>{<br/>    List hitResults = UnityARSessionNativeInterface.GetARSessionNativeInterface ().HitTest (point, resultTypes);</pre>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<ol start="5">
<li>We create a <kbd>Boolean</kbd> method type that has the parameters of <kbd>ARPoint</kbd> and <kbd>ARHitTestResultType</kbd>. Both of these are exposed by ARKit, and you can read the documentation for them or look at the source in Unity to gain a better understanding of it. The simplified explanation is that <kbd>ARPoint</kbd> is a point coordinate derived from a Vector 3 value, and <kbd>ARHitTestResultType</kbd> is an enum with the possible results being <kbd>ARHitTestResultTypeFeaturePoint</kbd>, <kbd><span>ARHitTestResultTypeEstimatedHorizontalPlane</span></kbd>, <kbd><span>ARHitTestResultTypeEstimatedVerticalPlane</span></kbd>, <kbd><span>ARHitTestResultTypeExistingPlane</span></kbd>, <kbd><span>ARHitTestResultTypeExistingPlaneUsingExtent</span></kbd>, and <kbd><span>ARHitTestResultTypeExistingPlaneUsingGeometry</span></kbd>.</li>
<li>We create a list called <kbd>hitResults</kbd> which is going to be set to be <kbd>UnityARSessionNativeInterface</kbd>. <kbd>GetARSessionNativeInterface().HitTest</kbd> with the parameters being point and result types filled in. What this does is create a list every time a native interface hit test is registered and stores the values:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">if (hitResults.Count &gt; 0) {<br/>    foreach (var hitResult in hitResults) {<br/>        Debug.Log ("Got hit!");<br/>        m_HitTransform.position = UnityARMatrixOps.GetPosition (hitResult.worldTransform);<br/>        m_HitTransform.rotation = UnityARMatrixOps.GetRotation (hitResult.worldTransform);<br/>        return true;<br/>    }<br/>}<br/>return false;<br/>}</pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>Next up, we do an <kbd>if</kbd> check to verify that the count is greater than <kbd>0</kbd>. If it isn’t greater than <kbd>0</kbd>, return as false, otherwise proceed to the <kbd>foreach</kbd> loop. Inside of the <kbd>foreach</kbd> loop, we check all of the hit results and log the results. The <kbd>HitTransform</kbd> position will always be set to be <kbd>UnityARMatrixOps.GetPosition</kbd> with the parameter being the <kbd>hitresult.worldTransform</kbd>.</li>
<li>The <kbd>HitTransform</kbd> rotation will also always be set to be <kbd>UnityARMatrixOps.GetRotation</kbd> with the parameter being the <kbd>hitresult.worldtransform</kbd>. We end by returning true. Essentially, all this function does is detect whether a hit is registered or not and passes information to the correct areas that need the information:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">void Update () {<br/>/* Let’s start the update method as it is probably the second most important aspect of the code.<br/>*/<br/> if (Input.touchCount &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; m_HitTransform != null)<br/> {<br/> var touch = Input.GetTouch(0);</pre>
<ol start="9">
<li>The first thing we want to do is check whether or not the <kbd>input.touchcount</kbd> is <kbd>0</kbd> and the <kbd>HitTransform</kbd> is not equal to null. If either of these checks fails, then we aren’t going to be able to retrieve the information we need.</li>
<li>We set a touch variable to be <kbd>input.gettouch</kbd> with the parameter being <kbd>0</kbd>. <kbd>0</kbd> is the basic tap gesture:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">if (touch.phase == TouchPhase.Began)<br/>{<br/>var screenPosition = Camera.main.ScreenToViewportPoint(touch.position);</pre>
<ol start="11">
<li>The <kbd>if</kbd> touch phase statement here is a check to see which touch phase is being initialized. The began touch phase is what we want, as it is the starting location of touch events.</li>
<li>We created a screen position variable and set it to be the camera screen to viewport point, with the parameter filled out being the touch position:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">ARPoint point = new ARPoint <br/>{<br/>    x = screenPosition.x,<br/>    y = screenPosition.y<br/>};</pre>
<ol start="13">
<li>ARPoint point is set to be a new ARPoint, and we want the <em>x</em> value to be the screen position’s <kbd>x</kbd> value and the <kbd>y</kbd> value to be the screen position’s <em>y</em> value:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">ARHitTestResultType[] resultTypes = {<br/>    ARHitTestResultType.ARHitTestResultTypeExistingPlaneUsingExtent,<br/>    ARHitTestResultType.ARHitTestResultTypeHorizontalPlane,<br/>    ARHitTestResultType.ARHitTestResultTypeFeaturePoint<br/>};</pre>
<ol start="14">
<li><kbd>ARHitTestResultType</kbd> is an array called result types. We want to make sure that the hit test result types are understood, and in this case, we have three types to use: <kbd>ExistingPlaneUsingExtent</kbd>, <kbd>HorizontalPlane</kbd>, and <kbd>FeaturePoint</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">foreach (ARHitTestResultType resultType in resultTypes)<br/>    if (HitTestWithResultType (point, resultType))<br/>      {<br/>          source.PlayOneShot(clips[Random.Range(0, clips.Length)]);<br/>          source.Stop();<br/>          return;<br/>      }</pre>
<ol start="15">
<li>We can now do a final <kbd>foreach</kbd> loop on the <kbd>ARHitTestResultType</kbd> and create an <kbd>if</kbd> statement to check the <kbd>HitTestWithResultType</kbd> with the parameters filled with the point and <kbd>resultType</kbd>. This essentially just checks to see if the proper touch events have occurred, and if they have, then it activates the play method. Upon another touch event, it will stop the media that was playing. Following that, we return to break from the loop.</li>
<li>We can go back to the Unity Editor and look at the cube object's attached script:</li>

<li>We can attach our <kbd>Cube</kbd> to be the <span class="packt_screen">Hit Transform</span> as when we tap, this will be the registered object to read the information:</li>
</ol>

<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>We can now build this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>To do this, click on <span class="packt_screen">File</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Build Settings</span>. We will be utilizing iOS as the platform:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d26f7bc0-3cc6-45e1-9ab1-eece6e8acce0.png"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>In <span class="packt_screen">Player Settings</span>, we need to change our app’s name in the <span class="packt_screen">Bundle Identifier</span> area and write a small description in the camera usage description.</li>
<li>I will name the app <kbd>com.rpstudios.arkitscene</kbd>, and the description will be <kbd>AR BABY</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/80f6410a-de88-43fa-a466-2fbf8f2955bc.png" style="width:29.42em;height:44.50em;"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Once we select <span class="packt_screen">Build</span> app, Unity will create an XCode project, which is the main difference between building for Android, Windows, and Linux:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6a629a93-3285-40f5-a5c5-9239233e01fd.png" style="width:32.25em;height:30.67em;"/></div>
<p>The main bulk of the work is done; now we just need to get familiar with XCode and finalize the build process there.</p>

<p>We can navigate to the <kbd>Build</kbd> folder of our application here and click on it to open our XCode project:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the left-hand side of the screen, you should see <span class="packt_screen">Unity-iPhone</span> as one of the items you can select. Click on it and you should see <span class="packt_screen">Unity-iPhone</span> in the center and <span class="packt_screen">Identity and Type</span> on the right:</li>

<li>Now, on <span class="packt_screen">Signing</span>, you need to look and make sure that the <span class="packt_screen">Automatically manage signing</span> checkbox is checked and your <span class="packt_screen">Team</span> has your email address attached to it. The <span class="packt_screen">Signing Certificate</span> is extremely important, as you will not be able to compile or send to the simulator properly. If you don’t, you have to register for an Apple Developer account at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">developer.apple.com</a>:</li>

<li>Locate <span class="packt_screen">Architectures</span>, because we need to change from the default to <span class="packt_screen">Standard</span>. This is due to there being different architectures and iOS doesn’t utilize ARM anymore:</li>

<li>Now, you can click on <span class="packt_screen">Build</span> and attach your iPhone 6 or above to your Mac computer. Build and then run it on the device. It will ask you to trust the app on your phone, so follow the instructions to give trust.</li>
<li>Click on the app on your phone and voila! It will load and you can play with the app.</li>

<p>In this chapter, we learned how to work with ARKit and Unity to build an AR application for Mac devices. While this was a very simple implementation, it should definitely pave the way for you to incorporate different aspects of sound into your own AR games and applications.</p>
<p>Learning the foundations of dealing with AR is possibly the most difficult part, as well as figuring out why building for different devices doesn’t work as you intended initially. Debugging and testing is something that should be integral to every aspect of development. I would suggest either having someone test every build, or run automated testing at every chance you get.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we are going to create an educational-style game prototype aimed at children, which will challenge their cognitive reasoning skills by means of a puzzle.</p>

<p>UML is a topic that is discussed in many circles, and there are plenty of resources on it that go into much more depth than I have. The reason for this is that UML could have a book written about it in order to do it proper justice:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/~chung/Fujitsu/UML_2.0/Rumbaugh--UML_2.0_Reference_CD.pdf">https://www.utdallas.edu/~chung/Fujitsu/UML_2.0/Rumbaugh--UML_2.0_Reference_CD.pdf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse403/11sp/lectures/lecture08-uml1.pdf">https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse403/11sp/lectures/lecture08-uml1.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Unity also has some fantastic tutorials where you can learn ARKit with Unity:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/learn-arkit">https://unity3d.com/learn/learn-arkit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These references should give you deeper insight into topics that I lightly touched on.</p>
