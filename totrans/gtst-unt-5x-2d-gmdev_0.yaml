- en: When Packt asked me to write this book, we had in mind something more modest
    than the book that you have today. While I was writing, I realized how many books
    can be found on the shelves that teach the basics without giving any practical
    insight on how to use that knowledge to actually make a game. Therefore, I slightly
    deviated the course of this book. As a result, it has changed into a somewhat
    solid manual about Unity, with a particular focus on 2D game development. The
    book that you are holding in your hands (either hard copy or on your tablet) is
    the outcome of a lot of effort trying to create something that is easy for the
    readers to understand, without sacrificing completeness or practical use of the
    different tools learned. Thus, everything is explained in detail, along with many
    examples of usage.

- en: Also, I felt that another big deficiency of many books is the lack of *Homework* sections
    that provide the reader with exercises to improve her/his skills. In fact, I believe
    that these sections are important, since they provide a common ground in case
    you want to challenge yourself and take the discussion beyond the book with your
    friends, course mates, or colleagues. In the field of game development, it's important
    to collaborate, because a game is often the result of the coordinate efforts of
    many talented and passionate people.

- en: For this book, I decided to support the learning of the different tools we will
    face by building a tower defense game on the joyful and sugary theme of cupcakes,
    sprinkles, and sweet-toothed pandas who will try to bite the delicious player's
    cake. This project will guide the reader through the book, and help her/him to
    develop a practical skillset as well.

    to adopt in your classes, an expert in game development trying out Unity (or willing
    to extend your understanding of Unity), or just a passionate hobbyist, I hope
    you will enjoy this book.

    improve the game we built in this book, along with improving your own skills to
    become a better game developer. Then, the chapter will give you an understanding
    of parts of the game development pipeline, which are not strictly tied to the
    development of the game itself. Thus, you will dive into different topics ranging
    from playtesting, optimizations, team management and work, documentation, getting
    ready to publish your game, marketing, social media, game protections, to even
    localization.'
