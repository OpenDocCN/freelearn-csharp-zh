<div><h1 class="mainHeading" id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Preface</h1>
<p class="normal">When we started writing this book, our main goal was to deliver hands-on experience on the main approach for developing cloud-native solutions: distributed applications. We decided to describe various options to build microservices architecture, which span from serverless implementation to Kubernetes orchestration. </p>
<p class="normal">Since our main technical background is .NET and Azure, we decided to focus on these, bringing an opportunity for developers to understand how and when serverless and microservices are the best ways to rapidly and consistently create enterprise solutions, thus enabling .NET developers to perform a career jump by entering the world of modern cloud-native and distributed applications. With this book, you will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Learn how to create serverless environments for developing and debugging in Azure</li>
<li class="bulletList">Implement reliable microservices communication and computation</li>
<li class="bulletList">Optimize microservices applications with the help of orchestrators such as Kubernetes</li>
<li class="bulletList">Explore Azure Functions in depth along with triggers for IoT and background activities</li>
<li class="bulletList">Use Azure Container Apps to simplify creating and managing containers</li>
<li class="bulletList">Learn how to properly secure a microservices application</li>
<li class="bulletList">Take costs and usage limits seriously and calculate them in the correct way</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">We believe that by reading this book, you will find great tips and practical examples that will help you write your own applications. We hope this focused material can leverage your knowledge about this important software development subject.</p>
