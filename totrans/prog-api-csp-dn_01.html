     Getting Started
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Let’s start by making sure you’re in the right place.
    
    
     This is a book about creating
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Application Programming Interfaces
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      APIs
     
    </strong>
    
     ) using .NET.
    
    
     Along the way, we will look at a
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker000">
    </a>
    
     very simple backend (database) and frontend (user interface) and the tools we use to create and
    
    
     
      test APIs.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The core responsibility of an API is to decouple an application (web, mobile, and so on) from the backend (database, another API, and more).
    
    
     The API sits between the frontend (the user interface to your application) and the backend (for our purposes,
    
    
     
      a database).
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following
    
    
     
      main topics:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     
      What software you
     
     
      
       will need
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      How to obtain the software
     
     
      
       you need
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Installing
     
     
      
       Visual Studio
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h1 id="_idParaDest-16">

     Technical requirements
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     To proceed through this book, you will need a computer running Windows (10 or 11) and an internet connection.
    
    
     It is best if your computer has at least 16 GB of memory, and, of course, you’ll need room on your disk for the software and for the code you
    
    
     
      will write.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     You can create APIs on any platform (e.g., Linux) and use any development environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code instead of Visual Studio).
    
    
     This book, however, will focus on Visual Studio and Windows as they are the most popular and arguably the most powerful way to create .
    
    
     
      NET APIs.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The code files for this book are available in the book’s GitHub
    
    
     
      repository:

     Where does the API fit in?
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     When you are creating a decoupled application, your principal
    
    
     
      parts are:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     
      The
     
     
      
       front end
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      The
     
     
      
       back end
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      
       The middleware
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     A typical front end
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker001">
    </a>
    
     might be a web application, a mobile application, or other ways of
    
    
     
      displaying data.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     A typical backend might be a database or
    
    
     
      another service.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The middleware sits between the front end and the back end.
    
    
     The most important middleware is the API.
    
    
     The job of the API is to ensure that the front end and back end are decoupled – that is, you can modify one without affecting the other.
    
    
     This is simply good programming practice and will save you hours (or months) of rewriting should either of these change (which
    
    
     
      they will!).
     
    
   </p>

     The players
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Typically, the
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker002">
    </a>
    
     backend and the frontend are created by different teams, though, of course, you can have one developer creating it all.
    
    
     We’re also going to restrict our backend to a simple database, though any source of data can be a backend.
    
    
     Finally, we’re not going to build a full frontend (that would be a distraction from the point of this book) but, rather, we’re going to
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker003">
    </a>
    
     use a tool,
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Postman
     
    </strong>
    
     , to mimic a frontend.
    
    
     There will be more on Postman throughout
    
    
     
      this book.

     You can create your backend, API, and frontend on any operating system you like.
    
    
     For this book, we’ll be creating all three on

     You

     We will look at how to work with this tool, and all the others, as
    
    
     
      we go.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Your next tool is Dapper.
    
    
     This is a small, lightweight ORM (often called a micro-ORM) that does one important part of the work of the much bigger SQL platform, Entity Framework, but with much less overhead.
    
    
     Specifically, Dapper will map queries
    
    
     
      to objects.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Since our needs will be minimal, Dapper will be more than enough.
    
    
     You can read more about
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker010">

     We will mimic our user interface with Postman, which we will also use for end-to-end testing.
    
    
     You can get the latest version of
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker011">

     You can also access Postman through your browser, but we’ll be using the
    
    
     
      downloaded version.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Postman is
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker012">
    </a>
    
     surprisingly powerful, and we will review how we will use it as we go along.
    
    
     That said, we will only scratch the surface of what you can do with this tool, so at some point, you may want to read
    
    
     
      the documentation.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     We will be using Swagger for documentation (see

     ), and the built-in logger functionality for (surprise!) logging errors and issues that will not be surfaced to the user, but which will be useful for you as
    
    
     
      the programmer.

     In this chapter, you saw what software you will need, how to download it, and how to install it.
    
    
     All of the software we’ll be using in this book is free.
    
    
     In the next chapter, we will see the example application that we’ll build to illustrate a meaningful use of
    
    
     
      an API.
