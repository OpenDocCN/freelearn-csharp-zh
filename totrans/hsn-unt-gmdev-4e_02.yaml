    Unity Hub, a tool that manages different Unity versions and projects, among other
    tasks. Unity Hub gives easy access to community blogs, forums, resources, and
    learning portals; it also manages your licenses and allows managing different
    installs and projects.

    The current release, Unity 2023.2, will be the final iteration of the 2023 series.
    The next version, which was supposed to be 2023.3 LTS, will instead be launched
    as Unity 6\. This transition marks the end of the **LTS** (**Long-Term Support**)
    release cycle, which forced Unity to undertake several releases each year. Moving
    forward, we anticipate the sequential roll-out of Unity versions 6.1, 6.2, 6.3,
    and so forth, each offering a stable platform enriched with new features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'LTS versions have the benefit that they are planned to be updated bi-weekly
    with bug fixes for 2 years, while new major versions of Unity release. That’s
    the reason most companies stick to LTS versions of the engine: because of its
    stability and long-term support. In this book, we will be using 2023.1 just to
    explore the new features of the engine, but consider sticking to LTS versions
    when developing commercial game titles.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Considering this, you may need to have several versions of Unity installed in
    case you work on different projects made with different versions. You may be wondering
    why you can’t just use the latest version of Unity for every project, but there
    are some problems with that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In newer versions of Unity, there are usually lots of changes to how the engine
    works, so you may need to rework lots of pieces of the game to upgrade it, including
    third-party plugins. It can take lots of time to upgrade the whole project, and
    that can push the release date back. Maybe you need a specific feature that comes
    with an update that will help you. In such a case, the cost of upgrading may be
    worthwhile. In projects that require maintenance and updates over several years,
    developers typically adhere to the existing version, opting to upgrade only when
    a new update includes a necessary feature.

    and updating new Unity releases, all used to be a huge hassle. Thus, **Unity Hub**
    was created to help us with this, and it has become the default way to install
    Unity. Despite this, it is not necessary for installing Unity, but we will keep
    things simple for now and use it. Let’s look closer into it.

    and `ProjectSettings`. `Assets` will hold all the files we will create and use
    for our game, so this is a must. We will also configure different Unity systems
    to tailor the engine to our game; all the settings related to this are in the

    to convert the files we will use to its own format in order to operate; an example
    is audio and graphics. Unity supports **MPEG Audio Layer 3** (**MP3**), **Waveform
    Audio File Format** (**WAV**), **Portable Network Graphics** (**PNG**), and **Joint
    Photographic Experts Group** (**JPG**) files (and much more), but prior to using
    them, they need to be converted to Unity’s internal formats, a process called
    **Importing Assets**. Those converted files will be in the `Library` folder. If
    you copy the project without that folder, Unity will simply take the original
    files in the `Assets` folder and recreate the `Library` folder entirely. This
    process can take time, and the bigger the project, the more time is involved.

    saw how to install and manage different Unity versions using Unity Hub. Finally,

    to dive into the Unity Editor.
