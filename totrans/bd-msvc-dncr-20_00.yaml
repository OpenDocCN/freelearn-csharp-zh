- en: Distributed systems are always hard to get complete success with. Lately, microservices
    are getting a considerable amount of attention. With Netflix and Spotify, microservice
    implementations have the become the biggest success stories in the industry. On
    the other hand, there are people who are of the opinion that microservices are
    nothing new or that they are only a rebranding of SOA.

    with regard to empowering the agile improvement and conveyance of complex venture
    applications.

- en: However, there is no clear practical advice on how to implement microservices
    in the Microsoft ecosystem and, especially, by taking advantage of Azure and the
    .NET Core framework. This book tries to fill that void.

    and operating microservice architectures built with .NET Core 2.0\. This book
    discusses all cross-cutting concerns along with the microservices design. It also
    highlights some important aspects to consider while building and operating microservices
    through practical *How Tos* and best practices for security, monitoring, and scalability.

    Microservices*, gets you familiar with microservice architectural styles, history,
    and how it differs from its predecessors: monolithic architecture and service-oriented
    architecture (SOA).'

    discusses the different factors that can be used to identify and isolate microservices
    at a high level, what the characteristics of a good service are, and how to achieve
    the vertical isolation of microservices.'

    types of collaborations, and the API gateway.'

    explains how the testing of microservices is different from the testing of a normal
    .NET application. It gets you acquainted with the testing pyramid.'

    covers how to deploy microservices and best practices. It also takes into account
    the isolation factor, which is a key success factor, along with setting up continuous
    integration and continuous delivery to deliver business change at a rapid pace.'

    covers the debugging and monitoring of microservices, which is not a trivial problem
    but quite a challenging one, as there is no single tool in the .NET ecosystem
    that is, by design, made for microservices. However, Azure monitoring and troubleshooting
    is the most promising one.'

    scalability, which is one of the most critical advantages of pursuing the microservice
    architectural style. This chapter will explain scalability by design and by infrastructure
    with respect to the microservice architecture.'

    You will learn how to build reactive microservices with the use of a reactive
    extension. It will help you focus on your main task and free you from the chores
    of communicating across services.'
