<p class="mce-root">Along with Windows 1.0, in the year 1985, Microsoft introduced Graphics Device Interface (<span>GDI</span>) and the USER subsystem in order to build a Windows-based Graphical User Interface (<span>GUI</span>). In 1990, OpenGL came into picture to create 2D and 3D graphics on Windows and non-Windows systems. In 1995, Microsoft presented another technology, called DirectX, to create high-performance 2D/3D graphics. Later, GDI+ was introduced to add alpha blending and gradient brush support on top of the existing GDI.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In 2002, Microsoft introduced .NET Framework. Along with this, Windows Forms was also introduced to build User Interface (<span>UI</span>) for Windows using C# and Visual Basic languages. It was built on top of GDI+, and hence, it still had the limitations of the GDI+ and USER subsystems.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Over the years, Microsoft decided to bring a new technology to build rich UIs for Windows-based applications, which not only helped the users (developers and designers) to escape the limitations of GDI/GDI+ and USER subsystems, but also helped them to improve their productivity when building desktop-based applications.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>In November 2006, a</span>long with .NET 3.0, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) was introduced to provide the developers a unified programming model to build dynamic, data-driven desktop applications for Windows. It came with a broad set of features to create a graphical subsystem to render rich UIs using various controls, layouts, graphics, resources, and more, considering the application and the security of the data. As it was first shipped as part of the .NET Framework 3.0, the first release was called WPF 3.0.</p>
<p class="mce-root">WPF is a resolution-independent framework that uses a vector-based rendering engine using an XML-based language called XAML (pronounced Zammel), to create modern user experiences that provided a declarative model for application programming. Using this, you can easily customize the controls and add skins to it to get a better representation of the application's UI.</p>
<p class="mce-root">As WPF was different than classic Windows Forms, as it uses XAML, data binding, templates, styles, animations, documents, and more, initially it got little attention. However, later, it started gaining a lot of popularity and attraction. Many updated versions were released to add more functionality to it to make it robust and powerful.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this book, we will cover a set of recipes that will show you how to perform common tasks using WPF. Starting with WPF fundamentals, we will cover standard controls, layouts, panels, data bindings, custom controls, user controls, styles, templates, triggers, and animations and later move on to the uses of resources, MVVM patterns, WCF services, debugging, threading, and WPF interoperabilities, to make sure you understand the foundation properly.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The examples given in this book are simple, easy to understand, and provide you with a what you need to learn and master the skills that you need to build desktop applications using WPF. By the time you reach the end of this book, you will be proficient enough with deep knowledge about each of the chapters that it covers. Although this book has covered most of the important topics, there will always be some topics that no books can completely cover. You will definitely enjoy reading this book, as there are lots of graphical and textual steps to help you gain confidence working with Windows Presentation Foundation.</p>
<h1 id="uuid-3c91102c-fd65-4732-9b14-aada19448c1c">Who this book is for</h1>
<p>The book is intended for developers who are relatively new to Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) or those who have been working with WPF for some time, but want to get a deeper understanding of its foundation and concepts to gain practical knowledge. Basic knowledge of C# and Visual Studio is assumed.</p>
<h1 id="uuid-380e9c6f-5ca8-49ac-a0af-77d407e2e990">What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="99d5630a-b934-43f4-a4df-0427f212a48a.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>WPF Fundamentals</em><span>, focuses on WPF's architecture, application types, and XAML syntax, terminologies, and explains how to install WPF Workload with Visual Studio 2017 to create your first application targeting Windows Presentation Foundation. It will cover the navigation mechanisms, various dialog boxes, building ownership between multiple windows, and then proceed toward creating a single instance application. This chapter will then cover how to pass arguments to WPF application and how to handle unhandled exceptions thrown in WPF.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="93049b3f-7f54-42eb-b881-fcf9713a4193.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Using WPF Standard Controls</em><span>, provides you with an in-depth knowledge to help you learn about various common control parts of WPF. This chapter will begin with TextBlock, Label, TextBox, and Image controls, and then continue with 2D shapes, Tooltip, standard menu, Context Menu, Radio buttons, and CheckBox controls. This chapter will also cover how to work with Progress Bar, Slider, Calendar, ListBox, ComboBox, StatusBar, and Toolbar panel.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><a href="0e967092-70e1-4932-bd6c-4ab7f4dda096.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Layouts and Panels</em><span>, gives you quick tour of the standard layout and panels. This chapter will cover how to use the panels to create proper layouts. It will also cover implementing the drag and drop feature in brief.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="2149da51-fc36-48bb-8eb6-4ab7c62dee23.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Working with Data Bindings</em><span>, discusses the important concept of data binding and how to use it in WPF. It also discusses CLR properties, dependency properties, attached properties, converters, and data operations (such as sorting, grouping, and filtering). The step-by-step approaches will guide you to be proficient with all types of data bindings.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="5865c944-df6f-49aa-9a20-c14f2719ea76.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Using Custom Controls and User Controls</em><span>, provides the basic building blocks you need to create custom controls and user controls that you can reuse in various places. You will also learn how to customize the control template using custom properties and events from the custom controls and user controls.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="caa93b54-a74b-421b-a776-7412e3294182.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Using Styles, Templates, and Triggers</em><span>, provides a deep insight into the styles and templates of a control, followed by various triggers that you can use to perform some operations or UI changes directly from the XAML, without using any C# code.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="ea41f2c7-5819-4da3-821c-63c0f128fafe.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Using Resources and MVVM Patterns</em><span>, begins by demonstrating various ways to use and manage binary resources, logical resources, and static resources. It will then continue with the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to build a WPF application by writing less code in the code behind file. The MVVM pattern is introduced with some examples to show how you can build command bindings.<br/></span></p>
