    possible for games of limited scope, such as hobby projects and prototypes, to
    get away with ignoring memory management. These games will tend to waste a lot
    of resources and potentially leak memory, but this won't be a problem if we limit
    its exposure to friends and coworkers. However, anything we want to release professionally
    needs to take this subject seriously. Unnecessary memory allocations lead to poor
    user experience due to excessive garbage collection (costing precious CPU time)
    and memory leaks, which will lead to crashes. None of these situations are acceptable
    in modern game releases.

    Unity engine, the Mono platform, and the C# language. Also, if we're making use
    of the new IL2CPP scripting backend, then it would be wise to become familiar
    with its inner workings. This can be a bit of an intimidating place for some developers
    since many pick Unity3D for their game development solution primarily to avoid
    the kind of low-level work that comes from engine development and memory management.
    We'd prefer to focus on higher-level concerns related to gameplay implementation,
    level design, and art asset management, but, unfortunately, modern computer systems
    are complex tools, and ignoring low-level concerns for too long could potentially
    lead to disaster.

    its cross-platform capability. Mono is an open source project that built its own
    platform of libraries based on the API, specifications, and tools from Microsoft's
    .NET Framework. Essentially, it is an open source recreation of the .NET library,
    was accomplished with little-to-no access to the original source code, and is
    fully compatible with the original library from Microsoft.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of the Mono project is to provide cross-platform development through
    a framework that allows code written in a common programming language to run against
    many different hardware platforms, including Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, PowerPC,
    and more. Mono even supports many different programming languages. Any language
    that can be compiled into .NET's **Common Intermediate Language** (**CIL**) is
    sufficient to integrate with the Mono platform. This includes C# itself, but also
    several other languages, such as F#, Java, Visual Basic .NET, pythonnet, and IronPython.

- en: A common misconception about the Unity engine is that it is built on top of
    the Mono platform. This is untrue, as its Mono-based layer does not handle many
    important game tasks such as audio, rendering, physics, and keeping track of time.
    Unity Technologies built a native C++ backend for the sake of speed and allowed
    its users control of this game engine through Mono as a scripting interface. As
    such, Mono is merely an ingredient of the underlying Unity engine. This is equivalent
    to many other game engines, which run C++ under the hood, handling important tasks
    such as rendering, animation, and resource management, while providing a higher-level
    scripting language for gameplay logic to be implemented. As such, the Mono platform
    was chosen by Unity Technologies to provide this feature.

- en: Scripting languages typically abstract away complex memory management through
    automatic garbage collection and provide various safety features, which simplify
    the act of programming at the expense of runtime overhead. Some scripting languages
    can also be interpreted at runtime, meaning that they don't need to be compiled
    before execution. The raw instructions are converted dynamically into machine
    code and executed the moment they are read during runtime; of course, this often
    makes the code relatively slow. The last feature, and probably the most important
    one, is that they allow simpler syntax of programming commands. This usually improves
    development workflow immensely, as team members without much experience using
    languages such as C++ can still contribute to the code base. This enables them
    to implement things such as gameplay logic in a simpler format at the expense
    of a certain amount of control and runtime execution speed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    **managed code**. Technically, this was a term coined by Microsoft to refer to
    any source code that must run inside their **Common Language Runtime** (**CLR**)
    environment, as opposed to code that is compiled and run natively through the
    target OS.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, because of the prevalence and common features that exist between the
    CLR and other languages that feature their own similarly designed runtime environments
    (such as Java), the term **managed** has since been hijacked. It tends to be used
    to refer to any language or code that depends on its own runtime environment,
    and that may or may not include automatic garbage collection. For the rest of
    this chapter, we will adopt this definition and use the term **managed** to refer
    to code that both depends on a separate runtime environment to execute and is
    being monitored by automatic garbage collection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The runtime performance cost of managed languages is always greater than the
    equivalent native code, but it is becoming less significant every year. This is
    partly due to gradual optimizations in tools and runtime environments, and partly
    due to the computing power of the average device gradually becoming greater although
    the main point of controversy with using managed languages still remains their
    automatic memory management. Managing memory manually can be a complex task that
    can take many years of difficult debugging to be proficient at, but many developers
    feel that managed languages solve this problem in ways that are too unpredictable,
    risking too much product quality. Such developers might claim that managed code
    will never reach the same level of performance as native code, and hence it is
    foolhardy to build high-performance applications with them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is true to an extent, as managed languages invariably inflict runtime overheads,
    and we lose partial control over runtime memory allocations. This would be a deal-breaker
    for high-performance server architecture; however, for game development, it becomes
    a balancing act since not all resource usage will necessarily result in a bottleneck,
    and the best games aren't necessarily the ones that use every single byte to their
    fullest potential. For example, imagine a user interface that refreshes in 30
    ms via native code versus 60 µs in managed code due to an extra 100% overhead
    (an extreme example). The managed code version is still fast enough that the user
    will never be able to notice the difference, so is there really any harm in using
    managed code for such a task?
  prefs: []

    just means that developers have a unique set of concerns to worry about compared
    to native code developers. As such, the choice to use a managed language for game
    development is partly a matter of preference and partly a compromise of control
    versus development speed.

    memory domains. Each domain stores different types of data and takes care of a
    very different set of tasks. Let''s take a look at each of them:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first memory domain—the managed domain—should be very familiar. This domain
    is where the Mono platform does its work, where any `MonoBehaviour` scripts and
    custom C# classes we write will be instantiated at runtime, and so we will interact
    with this domain very explicitly through any C# code we write. It is called the
    managed domain because this memory space is automatically managed by a **Garbage
    Collector** (**GC**).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second domain—the native domain—is more subtle since we only interact with
    it indirectly. Unity has an underlying native code foundation, which is written
    in C++ and compiled into our application differently, depending on which platform
    is being targeted. This domain takes care of allocating internal memory space
    for things such as asset data (for example, textures, audio files, and meshes)
    and memory space for various subsystems such as the Rendering Pipeline, physics
    system, and user input system. Finally, it includes partial native representations
    of important gameplay objects such as GameObjects and components so that they
    can interact with these internal systems. This is where a lot of built-in Unity
    classes keep their data, such as the `transform` and `Rigidbody` components.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third and final memory domains are those of external libraries, such as
    DirectX and OpenGL libraries, as well as any custom libraries and plugins we include
    in our project. Referencing these libraries from our C# code will cause a similar
    memory context switch and subsequent cost.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The managed domain also includes wrappers for the very same object representations
    that are stored within the native domain. As a result, when we interact with components
    such as `transform`, most instructions will ask Unity to dive into its native
    code, generate the result there, and then copy it back to the managed domain for
    us. This is where the native-managed bridge between the managed domain and native
    domains derives from, which was briefly mentioned in previous chapters. When both
    domains have their own representations for the same entity, crossing the bridge
    between them requires a memory context switch that can potentially inflict some
    fairly significant performance hits on our game. Obviously, crossing back and
    forth across this bridge should be minimized as much as possible due to the overhead
    involved. We covered several techniques for this in Chapter 2, *Scripting Strategies**.*

    function call, we couldn't allocate it on the stack since it would just get overwritten
    when the current function ends. So, instead, whenever a data type is too big to
    fit in the stack or must persist outside the function it was declared in, it is
    allocated on the heap.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    allocations are handled manually in that we are responsible for ensuring that
    all pieces of memory we allocate are properly and explicitly deallocated when
    they are no longer needed. If this is not done properly, then we could easily
    and accidentally introduce memory leaks since we are likely to keep allocating
    more and more memory space from RAM that is never cleaned up until there is no
    more space to allocate and the application crashes.
  prefs: []

    the initialization of our Unity app, the Mono platform will request a given chunk
    of memory from the OS and use it to generate a heap memory space that our C# code
    can use (often known as the **managed heap**). This heap space starts off fairly
    small, less than 1 MB, but will grow as new blocks of memory are needed by our
    script code. This space can also shrink by releasing it back to the OS if Unity
    determines that it's no longer needed.

    the GC will flag the memory space used by `GameObject` for eventual deallocation
    later. This is not an immediate process, as the GC only deallocates memory when
    necessary.

    the GC will need to scan all of the existing memory allocations for anything that
    is no longer being used and cleans them up first. It will only expand the current
    heap space as the last resort.

    indirectly accessible objects. In essence, it is gathering a set of objects that
    are still referenceable to our application. Everything that is not still referenceable

    If the object is marked, then it is still being referenced by something else,
    and so the GC leaves it alone. However, if it is not marked, then it is a candidate
    for deallocation. During this phase, all marked objects are skipped over, but
    not before setting their flag back to `false` for the first phase of the next
    garbage collection scan.

    maintains a separate list containing only a portion of them. Whenever our application

    between the GC's list and our application's list.

    situation and must expand the managed heap by requesting it from the OS, at which
    point the object space can finally be allocated and returned to the caller.
  prefs: []

    only a finite number of them exist at once, the heap would maintain a roughly

    allocations must always be contiguous in memory; therefore, the new object must
    be allocated in the next available contiguous 128-byte space available in the

    fragmentation, this effect would occur in literally any memory space—RAM, heap

    back from our favorite IDE (which is typically either MonoDevelop or the much
    more feature-rich Visual Studio) to the Unity Editor. However, the C# code is
    not converted directly into machine code, as we would expect static compilers
    to do if we are using languages such as C++.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, the code is converted into an intermediate stage called **Common Intermediate
    Language** (**CIL**), which is an abstraction above the native code. This is how
    .NET can support multiple languages—each uses a different compiler, but they're
    all converted into CIL, so the output is effectively the same regardless of the
    language that we pick. CIL is similar to Java bytecode, upon which it is based,
    and the CIL code is entirely useless on its own, as CPUs have no idea how to run
    the instructions defined in this language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    (**VM**), which is an infrastructure element that allows the same code to run
    against multiple platforms without the need to change the code itself. This is
    an implementation of the .NET CLR. If we're running on iOS, we run on the iOS-based
    VM infrastructure, and if we're running on Linux, then we simply use a different
    one that is better suited for Linux. This is how Unity allows us to write code
    once, and it works magically on multiple platforms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Within the CLR, the intermediate CIL code will actually be compiled into the
    native code on demand. This immediate native compilation can be accomplished either
    by an **Ahead-Of-Time** (**AOT**) or **Just-In-Time** (**JIT**) compiler. Which
    one is used will depend on the platform that is being targeted. These compilers
    allow code segments to be compiled into native code, allowing the platform's architecture
    to complete the written instructions without having to write them ourselves. The
    main difference between the two compiler types is when the code is compiled.

    (AOT) either during the build process or in some cases during app initialization.
    In either case, the code has been precompiled, and no further runtime costs are
    inflicted due to dynamic compilation since there are always machine code instructions
    available whenever the CPU needs them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: JIT compilation happens dynamically at runtime in a separate thread and begins
    just before execution (JIT for execution). Often, this dynamic compilation causes
    the first invocation of a piece of code to run a little (or a lot) more slowly
    because the code must finish compiling before it can be executed. However, from
    that point forward, whenever the same code block is executed, there is no need
    for recompilation, and the instructions run through the previously compiled native
    code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A common adage in software development is that 90% of the work is being done
    by only 10 percent of the code. This generally means that JIT compilation turns
    out to be a net positive on performance than if we simply tried to interpret the
    CIL code directly. However, because the JIT compiler must compile code quickly,
    it is not able to make use of many optimization techniques that static AOT compilers
    can exploit.

    object in question is one of the Unity object wrappers, such as a `GameObject`
    or `MonoBehaviour` component, then the finalizer will first invoke the `Dispose()`
    method within the native domain. At this point, the memory consumed by both the
    native and managed domains will then be freed. In some rare instances, if the
    Mono wrapper implements the `IDisposable` interface class (that is, it has a `Dispose()`
    method available from script code), then we can actually control this behavior
    and force the memory to be freed instantly.

    it would be a colossal waste of precious space. So, by calling their `Dispose()`
    method from script code, we can ensure that the memory buffers are freed promptly
    and precisely when they need to be.

    unused asset data, such as `Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets()`. Actual asset data
    is stored within the native domain, so the GC technically isn't involved here,
    but the idea is basically the same. It will iterate through all assets of a particular
    type, check whether they're no longer being referenced, and, if so, deallocate
    them. However, again, this is an asynchronous process, and we cannot guarantee
    exactly when the deallocation will occur. This method is automatically called
    internally after a scene is loaded, but this still doesn't guarantee instant deallocation.
    The preferred approach is to use `Resources.UnloadAsset()` instead, which will
    unload one specific asset at a time. This method is generally faster since time
    will not be spent iterating through an entire collection of asset data to figure
    out what is unused.

    the latter needs to be marked by the GC while it is performing its Mark-and-Sweep
    algorithm. Reference types are expected to (or need to) last a long time in memory
    due to their complexity, their size, or how they're used. Large datasets and any
    kind of object instantiated from a `class` instance is a reference type. This
    also includes arrays (regardless of whether it is an array of Value types or reference
    types), delegates, all classes, such as `MonoBehaviour`, `GameObject`, and any

    on the stack, but as soon as a value type is contained within a reference type,
    such as `class` or an array, then it is implied that it is either too large for

    more costly than just using a reference type and letting the GC take care of it.

    regardless of how large or small it is. So, if a `struct` object is passed by
    a value between five different methods in a long chain, then five different stack
    copies will occur at the same time. Recall that stack deallocations are effectively
    free, but stack allocations (which involve copying of data) is not. This data
    copying is pretty much negligible for small values, such as a handful of integers
    or floating-point values, but passing around ridiculously large datasets through
    structs over and over again is obviously not a trivial task and should be avoided.

    using the `ref` keyword to minimize the amount of data being copied each time
    (just a single pointer). However, this can be dangerous since passing by reference
    allows any subsequent methods to make changes to the `struct` object, in which
    case it would be prudent to make its data values `readonly`. This means that the
    values can only be initialized in the constructor, and never again, even by its
    own member functions, which prevents accidental changes as it's passed through

    member variable of a reference type. So, all of the usual rules for value types
    apply. The `_memberStruct` variable cannot have a value of `null`, and all of
    its fields will be initialized to `0` or `null` values. When `StoreStruct()` is
    called, the data from `ds` will be copied into `_memberStruct` in its entirety.

    allocated on the heap, and a pointer is all that is copied from one method to
    the next. Since a string is effectively an array, this implies that the characters
    it contains must be contiguous in memory. However, we often find ourselves expanding,
    contracting, or combining strings to create other strings. This can lead us to
    make some faulty assumptions about how strings work. We might assume that because
    strings are such common, ubiquitous objects, performing operations on them is
    fast and cheap. Unfortunately, this is incorrect. Strings are not made to be fast.

    original string object reference now points to a completely new string object.
    In which case, the old string object might no longer be referenced anywhere, will
    not be marked during *Mark-and-Sweep*, and will eventually be purged by the GC.
    As a result, lazy string programming can result in a lot of unnecessary heap allocations

    to the value of `localString`; now, the number of references to the `Hello` string
    returns back to one. The value of `testString`, therefore, has not been changed,

    circles. It turns out that a lot of `foreach` loops implemented in Unity C# code
    will incur unnecessary heap memory allocations during these calls, as they allocate
    an `Enumerator` object as a class on the heap, instead of a `struct` on the stack.
    It all depends on the given collection's implementation of the `GetEnumerator()`
    method.

    does not scale with the number of iterations. Only one `Enumerator` object is
    allocated and reused over and over again, which only costs a handful of bytes
    of memory overall. So, unless our `foreach` loops are being invoked for every
