- en: Discovering domain terminology is essential, and this terminology becomes a
    part of the Ubiquitous Language. However, the process of discovery can be rather
    lengthy and not always successful. When we discuss how the business works and
    what problems we are going to solve by writing software, too often the conversation
    comes down to discussing the features that the business is keen to implement.
    A set of features, of course, can be called **software**, but it does not necessarily
    form a system. Furthermore, to build a comprehensive solution for a particular
    problem, more system-level thinking is required.

    what business person would understand them? You could take notes to find out that

- en: Considering behavior as the central aspect of the domain knowledge, the whole
    EventStorming exercise is about finding out how the business works. In general,
    we could postulate that each system at any given moment of time is found in a
    particular state. This state can change when actors that interact with the system
    do something. Actions of those actors cause the system to change state, so we
    can see that something has happened and now we need to deal with a new situation.

- en: These facts are known as **domain events**. It is the most basic and also the
    most important concept that EventStorming deals with. It is why it is called EventStorming.
    The idea of domain events is not alien to anyone. Facts of life are something
    that people can quickly grasp. They are something that happened; not something

    subsequent changes in the system and therefore happen in a particular order. For
    example, the payment is not approved before it is signed. Some things can happen
    in parallel, such as debiting and crediting accounts at the same time, as soon
    as the payment order is approved, which might mean that the bank is confident
    that the payer has enough funds to complete the payment.

  zh: 有几件事情你可能立刻就会注意到。第一点是领域事件遵循时间轴。这是非常合乎逻辑的，因为事实代表了系统中随后的变化，因此按照特定顺序发生。例如，在签署之前，支付不会被批准。有些事情可以并行发生，比如在支付订单批准后立即同时借记和贷记账户，这可能意味着银行相信付款人有足够的资金来完成支付。
- en: The second thing is that we do not have only one system here. Indeed, we are
    modeling the whole process, but there are at least three parts that we can clearly
    distinguish—the user-facing internet bank, which creates and signs payment orders;
    the banking back office, which completes the transaction; and the payee's own
    payment-to-bill matching system that, by the way, could be completely manual.

  zh: 第二点是，我们这里不仅仅只有一个系统。实际上，我们正在模拟整个流程，但至少有三个部分我们可以清楚地区分——面向用户的互联网银行，它创建并签署支付订单；银行的后台办公室，它完成交易；以及收款人的自己的支付对账系统，顺便说一下，这可能完全是手工的。

    not that simple at the end of the day. Remember the availability heuristic, **WYSIATI**
    (short for **What You See Is All There Is**)? We base our initial understanding
    on a simplified view of the world. Everything works as it should; there are no
    exceptions and no edge cases, people behave and don't plan to make mistakes, with
    or without intentions to do so. It might come as a surprise, but the real world
    is a bit more complicated. Most of the time the number of edge cases; exceeds

    suggested, this is not how EventStorming works. We expect people to move around
    the room and be actively engaged in conversations, which might happen simultaneously
    at different sides of the room. So, we need some space. But this is not all the
    space we need. Have a good look at the preceding simple process model. Although
    we all could agree that we just modeled the happy path and no edge cases and exceptions
    are covered, the real-life process is way more complicated; this diagram already

    This is why you need as many of them as you can get in the workshop since these
    people are usually not easy to gather together in one room because of their busy
    schedule. This indirectly suggests that these people are generally quite high
    in the organizational hierarchy, but not necessarily. You need to aim at getting
    the most people from each department. You should search for those who know how

    it is the business who needs their problems to be solved, so it would be helpful

    might use a simple paper roll from IKEA, the original purpose of which is to provide
    unlimited painting space for children. But it is too narrow, and the best option

    When you organize such a session, you already know something about the organization

    this on the wall is exactly what people need to learn by example. The whole thing
    is not hard to do, but without an example, people don't feel safe and secure.
    So, as a facilitator, you will need to put the first sticky note on the wall,
    or a few of them. Try making it relevant, or you can intentionally make them very
    silly, expecting people to react with laughter and sarcasm, fixing your error.
    Of course, the first reaction that you get is people speaking out loud what they
    think needs to be put on the wall, without taking any action at all and expecting
    you to write things down. This is how *traditional* meetings are done—people talk,
    and someone hopefully is taking notes. Resist this. As soon as you see someone
    explaining what you need to write on the next sticky or telling you that the stuff
    on the wall is wrong, just give them a pen and a stack of sticky notes. They will
    start writing. They will produce. They will discuss. Then, your job will be to

    Starting at the *beginning* is something you want to avoid. It is very natural
    for us as human beings to seek structure, and in our view, each process starts
    and ends somewhere. So, logically speaking, we need to start at the beginning.
    The only issue here is that there is no beginning. First, we always spend a lot
    of time and energy discussing where the process starts, without producing anything.
    Second, there will be something before any identified start, guaranteed. Therefore,
    put the first sticky somewhere in the middle and work from there. Stuff that happens
    before that event will go to the left, and things that occur after, to the right:'

    the paper roll, but not at the edge. On the second sticky, he writes **Happily
    ever after** and puts it close to the right side of the paper roll, but again,
    not at the edge. You need these gaps on both sides because, as mentioned earlier,
    there will be definitely something earlier than **Once upon a time** and later
    than **Happily ever after**, and you will need space to put it there. As you can
    see, you need to have exactly zero knowledge about the domain to produce these
    two stickies, and it works quite efficiently. People get a sense of time, and
    with something already on the wall with space in between for them to fill, it

    if the payment has failed? What if the payment amount does not cover the full
    order total (partial payment)? What if goods aren't available in stock, although
    we think that they are? What if the parcel is lost in transit? All these things
    can and will happen. For developers, they might seem complicated, and usually,
    they don't know how to deal with these situations other than throwing an exception.
    But the business often has procedures in place to fix most of these situations,
    and these fixes can and should be modeled.

  zh: 尽量注意边缘情况。人们总是更喜欢模拟没有异常和错误发生的快乐路径。我们始终需要记住，在特定条件下，一个事件是另一个事件的后果。是的，可能会有一些直接的流程，但它们并不常见，尤其是如果我们谈论的是商业。例如，“支付处理”可以逻辑上导致“订单已支付”，然后是“订单已发货”，然后是“订单已送达”。但如果是支付失败呢？如果支付金额没有覆盖订单总额（部分支付）呢？如果商品库存不足，尽管我们认为它们有呢？如果包裹在运输途中丢失呢？所有这些事情都可能发生。对于开发者来说，他们可能会觉得这些情况很复杂，通常他们不知道如何处理这些情况，除了抛出异常。但业务通常有程序来处理这些情况中的大多数，并且这些修复可以也应该被建模。

    and uncertainty because not all exceptions are covered by business processes,
    or the people that you have available for the workshop don''t deal with such situations.
    If there are several domain experts in the room, they might disagree and argue
    with each other. For your short workshop, such circumstances are counterproductive.
    Therefore, if you observe that some heated discussion is taking place, or at some
    point, there are too many puzzled faces and no one can bring clarity to something,
    you can identify a hotspot. At this point, you need to introduce one more element

    to observe and essential to catch since you might be witnessing the first draft
    of your context map. We will discuss context maps later in the book. Do not discourage
    people from doing this, and go with the flow. Pay attention to how these islands

    You might need to ignite the fire again by offering to look at the model from
    a different perspective. There are at least two relatively easy ways to enrich
    the model by adding something that's missing. First, ask people to traverse the
    timeline backward. Very often, something that was considered not significant was
    not put on the wall, but this thing is essential for the next thing to happen.
    For example, someone might have forgotten that a packing list needs to be produced
    before the order is shipped. Another technique is to identify where the business
    creates value. Trivially, try following the money. Very often, developers get
    into discussing fancy nice-to-haves and forget that the business needs to earn
    something to pay their salary.

  zh: 当人们用尽想法时，可能会有一些尴尬的沉默时刻。你可能需要通过提供从不同角度审视模型的方式来重新点燃激情。至少有两种相对简单的方法可以通过添加缺失的内容来丰富模型。首先，要求人们倒着穿越时间线。很多时候，被认为不重要的东西没有被贴在墙上，但这个事情对于下一件事情的发生是至关重要的。例如，有人可能忘记在发货之前需要制作装箱单。另一种技术是确定业务创造价值的地方。简单地说，试着追踪资金流向。很多时候，开发者会陷入讨论一些花哨的、令人愉快的需求，而忘记了业务需要赚取一些东西来支付他们的薪水。
- en: Finally, as mentioned before, keep the time in mind and have at least one break
    per hour. Keep your promise and don't go overboard; don't keep people for longer
    than they have planned to stay. If you followed my advice and bought some fruit

    independent properties of the ad, which change differently. For example, uploading
    a picture is done separately, then the ad title is updated. Changing the ad category

- en: In this chapter, we have learned what EventStorming is, and why every team would
    benefit from organizing such a workshop with domain experts, that is, to gain
    domain knowledge and decrease ignorance. We also looked at some practical tips
    on how an EventStorming session can be arranged and facilitated.

- en: The final part of this chapter is about the model for our sample business. We
    discussed the business flow, identified many events and some hotspots, gaining
    a significant amount of insight into what kind of system we are going to build
    during this book.

    is more to it, which we cannot cover in this book due to the broad nature of this
    topic. Check out the next section to find references to Alberto Brandolini's work,
    and study the referenced materials to learn more about people, their biases and
    behaviors, and why software development is a learning process.

- en: The EventStorming community has a lot of discussions about using the technique
    in distributed teams or when end users aren't directly available to participate
    in such sessions. Alberto points out that the body language is extremely important
    to get an overall feeling of how the session goes and to identify the roles of
    the participants in the session and in the business. In my view, that is true,
    but we often deal with situations when such a session is nearly impossible to
    organize. For distributed systems, I would personally recommend using online real-time
    tools, like Miro, which I used to create many diagrams for this book. It allows
    for people to participate in modeling sessions wherever they are located.

  zh: EventStorming社区有很多关于在分布式团队中使用该技术或当最终用户无法直接参与此类会议时的讨论。阿尔贝托指出，肢体语言对于了解会议的整体进展以及识别与会者在会议和业务中的角色至关重要。在我看来，这是真的，但我们经常遇到这种会议几乎无法组织的情况。对于分布式系统，我建议个人使用在线实时工具，如Miro，我以前用它为这本书创建了许多图表。它允许人们无论身处何地都能参与建模会议。
- en: For SaaS businesses, the issue might be even harder because there's no single
    group of users that can be trusted to represent the whole user base. However,
    even with such a scenario, it is often possible to identify a group of the most
    engaged customers and invite them to be a part of your team. Not only you get
    great insights about how they use your system and how they want it to be improved,
    but also you get great free publicity by the word of mouth. People overall respect
    openness and greatly appreciate when their voice is heard by developers.

  zh: 对于SaaS业务，问题可能更加困难，因为没有单一的用户群体可以信任来代表整个用户基础。然而，即使在这样的场景中，通常也可以识别出一组最活跃的客户，并邀请他们成为你团队的一部分。这不仅让你能够深入了解他们如何使用你的系统以及他们希望如何改进它，而且通过口碑宣传，你还能获得很好的免费宣传。人们普遍尊重开放性，并且当他们的声音被开发者听到时，他们会感到非常感激。
