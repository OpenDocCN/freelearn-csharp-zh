			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, we will have learned how to architect cross-platform modern web solutions with ASP.NET Core to take advantage of its improved performance, which is one of the most obvious benefits of this framework along with its cloud-based development support.</p>
			<p>Moreover, we will get to know how to choose between traditional web apps and SPAs along with a quick comparison of <strong class="bold">Angular</strong>, <strong class="bold">React</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Vue</strong>. We will also learn how to choose the best Azure hosting approach for our solution.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Exploring the characteristics of modern web solutions</h1>
			<p>Irrespective <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>of the industry or business of the clients, the user expectations from modern web solutions are increasing with time. End users expect to use responsive web solutions that can be accessed from different devices with various screen sizes.</p>
			<p>Moreover, the web solutions must be secure, flexible, and scalable to allow adding new features within a short time and with less effort. Modern web solutions are expected to be easy to use with a well-developed user experience. This offers our clients a unique competitive <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>advantage to retain their customers and distinguish themselves from their competitors. In this section, we are going to highlight the main characteristics of modern web solutions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Scalable and cloud-hosted solutions</h2>
			<p>In the current modern era, cloud adoption is a way to accelerate digital transformation for <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>many reasons, such as the ability to automatically scale up or down the allocation of resources <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>based on emerging needs. Moreover, cloud hosting offers various tools to automate business operations along with strong security measures that <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>ensure the protection of personal data and customer information that might be associated with the web solution.</p>
			<p>ASP.NET Core is the best option, dealing perfectly with these factors. It is a cross-platform web framework that is optimized for cloud solutions. It is developed with performance and scalability in mind, which means less RAM and CPU consumption, and this will save us costs in infrastructure and hosting.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Modular and loosely-coupled architecture</h2>
			<p>Modular architecture is a design approach that consists of assembling multiple modules to <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>construct a system. The main benefits of the modular concept are flexibility, which allows us to easily <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>bring additional features to the system, and loosely coupled modules, which allow reducing the costs of maintenance.</p>
			<p>It is worthwhile <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>to use ASP.NET Core to implement the modular concept in modern web solutions. It is an open-source framework that is developed <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>out of different <strong class="bold">NuGet</strong> packages. This means our web solution will only compile packages that are really needed in the solution, and it won't include additional libraries that are never used, as is the case with .NET Framework. By eliminating the libraries that are not needed in the solution, we reduce security vulnerabilities in one way or another.</p>
			<p>ASP.NET Core is <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>designed to allow for <strong class="bold">dependency injection</strong>. This is a design technique used to reduce the dependency problems between components <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>or classes through the use of an interface, or by injecting the concrete implementation of a low-level class into a higher one.</p>
			<p>Check out <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>the Microsoft documentation for more information about dependency injection: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-5.0&#13;">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-5.0.</a></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Automated testing</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Testing</strong> is an essential <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>phase to certify the product we are developing. While <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>manual testing is still important for many reasons, such as exploratory testing and visual testing, automated tests offer great benefits such as saved costs, increased productivity, high-quality products, and better performance. </p>
			<p>ASP.NET Core allows us to easily test the system we are developing because the framework is flexible and reliable, allowing fast automated testing. It provides capabilities <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>to easily write unit tests for <strong class="bold">Model-View-Controller</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVC</strong>) <strong class="bold">apps</strong> as well as <strong class="bold">Web APIs</strong> that are mandatory for modern web <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>solutions. It is seamlessly integrated with Azure allowing us to have <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>full access to the latest features in <strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> testing tools, which is very valuable to the product and the development team. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Traditional and single-page application support</h2>
			<p>SPAs are trendy in the web world, though it doesn't mean that every web solution should <a id="_idIndexMarker613"/>be developed using this technique. Traditional web solutions based <a id="_idIndexMarker614"/>on the MVC framework are still in demand and can be used in many cases. Traditional <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>web solutions with <strong class="bold">ASP.NET MVC</strong> rely on the server <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>to deal with the requests and render back the views, while SPAs rely heavily on Web APIs to get the data needed to render the components.</p>
			<p>Many web solutions, nowadays, involve both the behaviors of traditional web apps and SPAs. ASP.NET supports having an MVC web application along with a web API in the same Visual <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>Studio project. Moreover, it allows building web <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>apps using any of the modern frontend frameworks, such as Angular, React, and Vue, along with a server-side <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>backend web API.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Fast deployment</h2>
			<p>It is essential <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>to easily deploy new changes <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>to web solutions. With <strong class="bold">Azure DevOps</strong> pipelines, we can automate the deployment process of ASP.NET Core solutions as part of the <strong class="bold">continuous integration</strong> and <strong class="bold">continuous delivery</strong> pipeline. Microsoft Azure is also integrated with <strong class="bold">Git</strong> repositories, allowing the automatic deployment of new changes <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>that are made to a particular Git branch or tag.</p>
			<p>Moreover, we <a id="_idIndexMarker623"/>can use the tools and practices provided by GitHub, which are fully integrated with Azure, to deliver our products faster. Through GitHub Actions, which are similar to Azure pipelines, we can automate software development processes with the usage of workflows that are made up of steps and jobs. These workflows can help us build, test, package, release, and deploy any project on GitHub with an automated workflow.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Progressive web apps with Blazor</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Blazor</strong> is a web <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>framework <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>that provides awesome capabilities to build interactive web applications <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>using <strong class="bold">C#</strong> instead of <strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong>. It relies on open web standards <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>with no need to install any <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>kind of plugin. It can be used to build SPAs as well as <strong class="bold">Progressive Web Applications</strong> (<strong class="bold">PWAs</strong>). </p>
			<p>PWAs are web apps that make use of the latest technologies of the browser to deliver a user experience that is similar to mobile apps. They are a powerful trend in mobile and web development. Blazor <strong class="bold">WebAssembly</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>client-side framework that can be used to build PWA apps. Here are the benefits of this technique:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It allows for seamless offline operations and the app can load instantly. Later, it can sync with the server to send back the data.</li>
				<li>Low development costs because we don't have to build different versions for multiple devices.</li>
				<li>It provides users with a similar UI/UX to mobile apps.</li>
				<li>The possibility <a id="_idIndexMarker630"/>to push notifications from the server like with native apps, even when users are not using the app.</li>
				<li>No need <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>to publish the app to a store for distribution and discovery. The app can be accessed through a link or <a id="_idIndexMarker632"/>a shortcut link that can be placed in the Start menu or on the home screen.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this section, we highlighted a set of key characteristics of modern web solutions. In the next section, we will learn how to choose between traditional web apps and SPAs.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Choosing between traditional web apps and single-page apps</h1>
			<p>So far, we have seen that there are two approaches to building web applications. One approach <a id="_idIndexMarker633"/>is the traditional way, where all the application logic is served on the server side. The other one is <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>the modern approach represented by SPAs, where all the user interaction is handled by the browser using a client-side framework that communicates with the web server by consuming a web API. There is also a way to have a hybrid solution by combining the two approaches together in one solution.</p>
			<p>The following diagram shows the two approaches. We can see that in the <strong class="bold">Single Page Application</strong>, we have multiple templates that will be rendered in one single page using a client-side framework; also, there is no full-page refresh in this approach. While in the <strong class="bold">Traditional Web Application</strong>, we can see multiple pages that enforce a full refresh of the page when navigating from one page to another:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.01_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 9.1: Single-page application versus traditional web application"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.1: Single-page application versus traditional web application</p>
			<p>A question <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/>that usually <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>comes to mind every time we want to architect and develop a new web solution is, <em class="italic">which approach should we adopt – traditional or single page?</em> Let's learn how to choose between these two approaches.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Selecting traditional web applications</h2>
			<p>Before we <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>start discussing the key reasons for choosing traditional web applications, let's understand the page lifecycle of this approach. Here is a diagram showing the request lifecycle in a traditional web application:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.02_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 9.2: Traditional page lifecycle"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.2: Traditional page lifecycle</p>
			<p>In the preceding diagram, we can see the initial request is made by the user to browse a page. This request is received by the server, which will process it and return an HTML page as a response, which is considered as a full-page refresh. It is the same behavior when we post a form to the server.</p>
			<p>A good example <a id="_idIndexMarker638"/>of this approach is the classic ASP.NET MVC application that is not making use of any JavaScript framework to render views through <strong class="bold">AJAX</strong> requests.</p>
			<p>Now, let's get to <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>know when we should choose the traditional web application approach:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the client-side requirements of the application are simple, then the traditional approach is a good fit. For example, most <strong class="bold">CMS</strong> websites are used by users to read content with a minor need for client-side functionalities. In this case, the traditional approach should be adopted to develop such applications where the actual logic is executed on the server and the response is returned as HTML to the user's browser. Check the <em class="italic">New York Times</em> website – you will notice that when you navigate from one article to another, the URL in the browser changes, which is a sign that this website is built using the traditional approach. </li>
				<li>If JavaScript and famous frontend frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue have not been adopted by our team and there is not enough time to train them before we start a project.</li>
				<li>If the client request is to load the web app without JavaScript support, in this case, all JavaScript libraries will be disabled by default in the browser. In most cases, this is requested in intranet web apps and not online websites. In online websites, it is a must to have JavaScript enabled, otherwise, we won't be able to open the website from various devices.</li>
				<li>If SEO is an <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>essential matter in the project to improve content marketing and drive more leads and readers to the website. It is possible to configure the SPA to improve the SEO ranking of the application. However, this ranking shows better results with multiple pages having proper URLs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are the main key factors that will lead us to choose the traditional approach. In the next section, we will learn when to choose the SPA approach.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Choosing single-page applications </h2>
			<p>An SPA is a <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>one-page application with multiple views that are rendered using JavaScript on a single page. In the following diagram, we will explore the request lifecycle in an SPA:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.03_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 9.3: Single-page application lifecycle"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.3: Single-page application lifecycle</p>
			<p>In the preceding diagram, we can see the initial request is triggered by the end user opening the SPA app for the first time. The server will answer by returning the full HTML of the home page. Moreover, the user will trigger another functionality such as updating data in the database and refreshing the view.</p>
			<p>This will be <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>achieved through an <strong class="bold">AJAX</strong> technique that is used by most of the famous frontend frameworks. The <strong class="bold">AJAX</strong> call will consume a web service or a web API and return a <strong class="bold">JSON</strong> object, then it will refresh the view only without having a full-page refresh. This creates a fluid user experience allowing users to feel like they are using a native app.</p>
			<p>Now, let's get <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>to know when we should choose the SPA approach:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If it is requested to provide users with the ability to work offline when they are not connected to the network or the internet. The SPA approach will give users the ability to sync their data with the server when the application is connected to the network again.</li>
				<li>If consuming less bandwidth is essential. It is known that SPA apps load their resources once during the initial request and they consume less bandwidth than traditional web apps because they do not load and transmit the full HTML page on every request.</li>
				<li>If the response time and user experience are crucial for the client. It is well known that the response time of requests in SPAs is way better than traditional applications. Moreover, the seamless and rich user experience can significantly affect the business of our clients and eventually increase leads and sales. </li>
				<li>If SEO is <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>not important for the web application and if your team is knowledgeable with JavaScript, TypeScript, and any of the frontend frameworks such as Angular, React, Vue, or Blazor WebAssembly.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this section, we learned how to choose between traditional web applications and SPA web applications. We also explained the request lifecycle for both approaches. In the next section, we are going to have a quick overview of some common SPA architectures.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>Understanding the structure of SPAs with ASP.NET Core</h1>
			<p>With <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>proper architecture, features can easily be developed, and we can reach an outstanding client's satisfaction. This <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>approach is challenging because it requires solid architectural expertise and a proper hosting approach, but it always succeeds in delivering a decent solution.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will get to know the structure of SPAs with ASP.NET Core. We will explore the project structure of the three top modern SPA technologies: Angular, React, and Vue.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Angular SPAs</h2>
			<p>Angular <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>offers a full MVC pattern implementation. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker648"/>still one of the best JavaScript frameworks that is used to build SPAs. Today, with the latest version of <strong class="bold">Visual Studio</strong>, we can create a new ASP.NET web application with Angular enabled.</p>
			<p>The project will be a combination of the Angular <code>ClientApp</code> folder along with the web API that is usually included in the <code>Controllers</code> folder, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.04_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 9.4: Structure of an Angular app with ASP.NET Core"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.4: Structure of an Angular app with ASP.NET Core</p>
			<p>The <code>ClientApp</code> folder usually contains all the files related to an Angular CLI-based frontend <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>application and the <code>Controllers</code> folder contains <a id="_idIndexMarker650"/>all the API endpoints. The following list explains the main files and folders under the Angular client app shown in the preceding screenshot:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>e2e</code>: This folder is used to create the different types of testing and it relies on a testing library called <code>Protractor</code>.</li>
				<li><code>src</code>: This folder contains the frontend code that we will develop to render the components; we will spend most of the time writing code in this folder. It includes the styling file along with the configuration files to run the app.</li>
				<li><code>angular.json</code>: This is the configuration file where we can specify the HTML starting page along with the main TypeScript file that should be executed at the beginning of the application.</li>
				<li><code>.editorconfig</code>: This is the configuration file where we set the settings that should be <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>applied by the editor when adding or modifying files in the Angular app.</li>
				<li><code>package.json</code>: This file <a id="_idIndexMarker652"/>contains the list of dependencies that need to be available to develop and deploy the application.</li>
				<li><code>README.md</code>: This contains, by default, the basic project documentation in Markdown format. </li>
				<li><code>tsconfig.json</code>: This contains the configuration needed for the TypeScript compiler.</li>
				<li><code>tslint.json</code>: This contains a list of rules that should be checked by the <strong class="bold">tslint</strong> tool to validate <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>the quality of the TypeScript code.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>React SPAs</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">React</strong> is one <a id="_idIndexMarker654"/>of the most popular JavaScript libraries used to build fast and interactive SPAs. It focuses <a id="_idIndexMarker655"/>on the views part <a id="_idIndexMarker656"/>of the application, mainly the UI components, therefore it requires using additional libraries to build the entire SPA.</p>
			<p>In Visual Studio, we can make use of the existing project templates to create a new ASP.NET Core application with React. The following screenshot shows the project structure of the React application. The <code>ClientApp</code> folder contains all the files related to React and we can see the <code>Controllers</code> folder, which holds the .NET Web API:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.05_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 9.5: Structure of the React app with ASP.NET Core"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.5: Structure of the React app with ASP.NET Core</p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>list explains the main files and folders under the React client <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>app shown in the preceding screenshot:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>public</code>: This folder contains the static files of the application such as the HTML index page.</li>
				<li><code>src</code>: This folder contains all the dynamic components that we will develop. It also contains the <code>App.js</code> file, which acts as the main <code>index.js</code> file, it represents the entry point of the application that triggers the <code>registerServiceWorker.js</code> file, which is used to cache the assets of the application. This caching mechanism helps load the application faster and allows offline capabilities.</li>
				<li><code>package.json</code>: This file contains the list of dependencies used in the application.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>Vue SPAs</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Vue</strong> is a JavaScript framework that, when combined with other libraries, is used to build modern SPAs. Unlike <a id="_idIndexMarker659"/>other monolithic <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>frameworks, Vue is a lightweight and easy-to-learn framework. In Visual Studio, we can create an ASP.NET Core application with Vue.</p>
			<p>Similar to the other project templates, the Vue files are included within the <code>ClientApp</code> folder and the <code>Controllers</code> folder, which contains the Web API controllers, as per the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.06_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 9.6: Structure of the Vue app with ASP.NET Core"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.6: Structure of the Vue app with ASP.NET Core</p>
			<p>The following list explains the main files and folders under the React client app shown in the preceding screenshot:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>public</code>: This folder contains the static files of the application such as the HTML index page.</li>
				<li><code>src</code>: This folder <a id="_idIndexMarker661"/>contains all the dynamic components that we will develop. It also contains the <code>App.vue</code> file, which acts as the root component <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>of the application. The <code>main.js</code> JavaScript file is responsible for initializing the root component and introducing the required plugins. As for the <code>assets</code> folder, it contains all the static assets, such as the CSS files and the images. </li>
				<li><code>package.json</code>: This file contains the list of dependencies used in the application.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>After this quick overview of the structure of these three frameworks (Angular, React, and Vue), we may ask ourselves, <em class="italic">which framework should we use?</em> It is difficult to answer this question because it is hard to find a framework that works for every situation. Here is a table showing a quick comparison between the three frameworks:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.07_B17366.jpg" alt="Figure 9.7: A quick comparison between Angular, React, and Vue"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.7: A quick comparison between Angular, React, and Vue</p>
			<p>Although Angular and React are perfect frameworks to build large-scale and enterprise web solutions <a id="_idIndexMarker663"/>with complex components <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>and very dynamic content, writing code in React is easier and faster than Angular. According to a Stack Overflow Developer Survey conducted in 2020, React is the second most popular framework after <strong class="bold">jQuery</strong>: <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies">https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies</a>.</p>
			<p>While Vue is lightweight and easy to learn, it demonstrates the best performance between the three frameworks. Also, the Vue development community is rising steadily compared to React and Angular. </p>
			<p>In the next section, we will get to know the three main options to host our web applications with Azure.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>Exploring Azure hosting recommendations</h1>
			<p>Azure hosting <a id="_idIndexMarker665"/>offers great hosting capabilities for every business out there, whichever sector the web application is serving. It provides a wide range of cloud services that support us to host and scale web solutions. It helps us to deal with business challenges rather than spending time focusing on the infrastructure that we need to host the solution.</p>
			<p>There are three ways to host web applications in Azure:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">App Service Web Apps</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Containers</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Virtual Machines</strong> (<strong class="bold">VMs</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>App Service <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>Web Apps is the recommended <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>hosting approach for most scenarios <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>as it offers a fully managed <strong class="bold">Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>) that is optimized in a way that lets our clients focus <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>on their business, while Azure takes care of the required infrastructure, including scaling the application. Moreover, we can make use <a id="_idIndexMarker670"/>of Azure <strong class="bold">Static Web Apps</strong> to automatically deploy full-stack web apps that are built using libraries and frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue to <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>Azure from a code repository that can be on GitHub or Azure DevOps.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note:</p>
			<p class="callout">Check out the Microsoft documentation for more information about the step-by-step deployment process with Azure App Service: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/host-a-web-app-with-azure-app-service/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/host-a-web-app-with-azure-app-service/</a>.

			<p>For applications that implement microservice architecture, it is recommended to host them using a container-based approach.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note:</p>
			<p class="callout">Here is a Microsoft reference link on how to deploy a container instance in Azure using the Azure portal: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-quickstart-portal">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-quickstart-portal</a>.

			<p>If your application is not fully ready to be hosted on the cloud and if you would like to have more control <a id="_idIndexMarker672"/>over the hosting environment, you can choose <strong class="bold">Azure Virtual Machines</strong>, which is an <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaaS</strong>). However, if you <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>choose this option, you must take into consideration that you need an ongoing maintenance effort to manage the VM <a id="_idIndexMarker674"/>environment and keep it up to date.</p>

			<p>In this chapter, we explored some key characteristics of modern web solutions that we must know to build scalable and cloud-hosted solutions. We learned about the difference between traditional web applications and SPAs, and how to choose between them.</p>
			<p>Moreover, we had an overview of the project structure for the three modern frontend frameworks to build SPAs with the ASP.NET Core Web API, and we provided a quick comparison table between these frameworks. Later in this chapter, we explored the main options to host web applications in Azure with high-level recommendations to know how to choose the best hosting approach for our solution.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will dig deep into designing and implementing <strong class="bold">Microsoft DevOps</strong> solutions and we will learn about their benefits.</p>
