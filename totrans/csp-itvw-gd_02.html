			<p class="calibre3">Welcome to our detailed guide, designed to be your ally in navigating the complex world of job applications. In this book, we aim to equip you with the essential skills and knowledge to excel in the competitive job market. By the end of this journey, you will have learned how to craft impactful resumes, write effective cover letters, build strong online profiles, and confidently approach job interviews.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In the first chapter, we will dive into several crucial topics. You’ll learn how to make a resume that gets noticed and what to include to highlight your skills and experience. Further, you’ll understand how to write a cover letter that tells your story and matches the job you want. It’s a chance to explain why you’re the right fit.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Next, we’ll guide you on making a LinkedIn profile that shows your professional journey. It’s important for making connections and getting noticed. Finally, for tech jobs, a GitHub profile can show off your coding skills. We’ll help you set up a profile that displays your best work and teamwork.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">Creating a good resume</li>
				<li class="calibre11">Drafting a cover letter</li>
				<li class="calibre11">Utilizing LinkedIn</li>
				<li class="calibre11">Utilizing GitHub</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s start with <em class="italic">Creating a Good Resume</em>. In this section, we’ll focus on how to make a resume that stands out. You’ll learn about the key elements of a good resume, from its structure to how to customize it for different jobs. A well-crafted resume is your first step towards great job opportunities.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-16" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor015" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Creating a good resume</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">A <strong class="bold">resume</strong> is the first and only thing that the HR manager<a id="_idIndexMarker000" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> sees about the candidate, and it’s your task<a id="_idIndexMarker001" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> to make this information about you compelling enough to catch and hold their attention. Of course, I will provide examples of resumes, CVs, and cover letters later, but let’s first understand the difference between a resume and a CV.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-17" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor016" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Resume versus CV</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The alignment of these terms<a id="_idIndexMarker002" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> can either be identical <a id="_idIndexMarker003" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>or vary, contingent upon the specific region where the job search is being conducted. Therefore, if we consider the regional distinctions, it is important to note that CV and resume may be perceived as distinct concepts.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">A resume is needed to provide a brief summary of your work experience, skills, achievements, and education. In other words, a resume is necessary to give the recruiter and employer a general understanding of your work experience.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">A <strong class="bold">curriculum vitae</strong> (<strong class="bold">CV</strong>) contains a story of your experience starting from higher education and academic activity, supplementing information with facts about published works, awards, and merits, the places of your work, details about projects, duties, and more.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The following table gives a more detailed comparison:</p>

			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 1.1 – Comparison between a resume and CV</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Regardless, let’s create a universal mix of a resume and a CV. This will be a template that you can edit to suit the job vacancy.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s start with the basic sections:</p>
			<ol class="calibre15">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Contact information</strong>: This should be at the top of your resume <a id="_idIndexMarker004" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>and include your name, phone number, email address, and the link to your LinkedIn and GitHub profile.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Objective</strong>: This is a brief statement about your career<a id="_idIndexMarker005" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> goals or a summary of your skills and qualifications. This section should be tailored to the specific job you are applying for.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">About me</strong>: This section should present<a id="_idIndexMarker006" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> a concise and captivating overview of who you are, your main qualifications, and why you are suited for the role.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Skills</strong>: This section should list your key skills <a id="_idIndexMarker007" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>and abilities that are relevant to the job you are applying for. You should aim to include both soft and hard skills, such as communication, teamwork, programming languages, or data analysis.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Work experience</strong>: Here you should list your previous<a id="_idIndexMarker008" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> jobs in reverse chronological order, with the most recent job first. For each job, include the name of the company, your job title, the dates you worked there, and a brief summary of your responsibilities and achievements.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Education</strong>: This section should list your educational <a id="_idIndexMarker009" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>background, again in reverse chronological order. Include the name of the institution, the degree you obtained, and the dates of attendance. If you have recently graduated, you may also want to include relevant coursework or projects.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Certifications</strong> (<strong class="bold">Licenses</strong>): If you have any professional certifications<a id="_idIndexMarker010" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> or licenses that are relevant to the job you are applying for, include them in this section.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Awards and achievements</strong>: If you have received any awards or recognitions<a id="_idIndexMarker011" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> in your professional or academic career, list them here.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Languages</strong>: If you are multilingual, it’s important <a id="_idIndexMarker012" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>to note it on your resume as it’s often a highly desirable skill in many fields.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="calibre3">I would advise creating a good basic description and then adapting points 2, 3, and 4 according to the vacancies you are applying for. Let’s delve into these points in more detail in the next sections.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-18" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor017" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>The Objective section</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">This is the first piece of information<a id="_idIndexMarker013" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> about you, the objective of your search. This format should highlight your strongest skills, abilities, and ambitions to impress<a id="_idIndexMarker014" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> the employer. Here’s an example:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">Experienced C# developer with more than five years of experience and a deep knowledge of OOP, .NET Framework, .NET Core, Entity Framework, SQL, and web </em><em class="italic">services development</em></li>
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">Known for working effectively in a team and adhering to established schedules </em><em class="italic">and deadlines</em></li>
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">Aim to provide high-level programming and an analytical approach for XYZ company to achieve strategic </em><em class="italic">goals together</em></li>
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">Constantly striving for professional growth, learning new technologies, and adapting to rapidly changing </em><em class="italic">technical conditions</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s analyze this text and determine<a id="_idIndexMarker015" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> how important these points are for an HR manager and how they can be tailored for a specific position:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Experience</strong>: Stating your experience of over five years offers immediate proof of your longevity and familiarity in the field. To an HR manager, this suggests a proven track record of handling various tasks and problem-solving scenarios. Depending on the specific role, you could emphasize different aspects of your experience that align with the job requirements.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Technical proficiencies</strong>: By listing key technologies, you showcase a strong technical base in your area of expertise. HR managers will look for these specific skills to match the job description. Make sure to highlight those technologies that are particularly relevant to the position you’re applying for.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Soft skills</strong>: Your capability to work effectively within a team and stick to established timelines are valuable skills in almost all job roles. HR managers are not just looking for technical proficiency but also interpersonal skills and professionalism. Tailor this section to the job by emphasizing those soft skills that the job ad particularly values, such as communication or leadership.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Goal orientation</strong>: Expressing your ambition to contribute to the strategic objectives of the company demonstrates your understanding of the larger business context, not just the technical side. This alignment with company goals is attractive to HR managers as it suggests you’ll be driven to contribute to the company’s success. If possible, try to align your stated goals with the mission or objectives of the company you’re applying to.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Adaptability and lifelong learning</strong>: These traits are critical in the fast-paced tech industry. To an HR manager, this indicates that you’re not only open to changes but actively seek to expand your skill set and stay updated, which is crucial for a company’s growth and adaptation to market changes. If the job ad mentions a fast-paced environment or a need for adaptability, make sure to emphasize this aspect<a id="_idIndexMarker016" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> in your approach.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">All right, we have discussed the Objective part of the resume. Let’s move on to the next one, that is, the About Me section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor018" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>The About Me section</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The <strong class="bold">About Me</strong> section in a resume, sometimes known as a <strong class="bold">personal statement</strong> or <strong class="bold">personal summary</strong>, is a short paragraph that describes<a id="_idIndexMarker017" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> your professional<a id="_idIndexMarker018" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> skills, goals, and<a id="_idIndexMarker019" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> experience. It helps an employer quickly understand who you are as a professional and what you can bring to the company. Here are some tips<a id="_idIndexMarker020" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> on how to write this section:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Define your professional image</strong>: Start with a brief phrase that describes you as a professional. This could be your strongest specialization or the role you most often perform. For example: <em class="italic">Experienced </em><em class="italic">C# developer</em>.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Highlight key skills</strong>: Include two to three key skills you possess. These could be technical skills (for example, experience with specific technologies) or soft skills (for example, teamwork and leadership).</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Emphasize important achievements</strong>: Include a brief description of one or two of your most significant achievements in your career. This could be a successful project you carried out or a significant problem you solved.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">State your goals</strong>: If you have specific professional goals, state them. This could be a desire to work on certain types of projects, use specific technologies, or develop certain skills.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Focus on what you can offer the employer</strong>: Your personal statement should be employer-focused. Highlight what you can bring to the company, not just what you want to achieve.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Be brief and specific</strong>: Your personal statement should be short and clear. It should be easy to read quickly, so try<a id="_idIndexMarker021" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> to keep it within three to five sentences.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Here’s an example<a id="_idIndexMarker022" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> of a personal <a id="_idIndexMarker023" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>statement for a C# developer:</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">As a passionate technology enthusiast, my interest in coding has shaped my career as a C# Developer. I am known for my dedication to teamwork, meticulous attention to detail, and a knack for problem-solving. A firm believer in the power of continual learning, I’m always on the lookout for new technology and opportunities to further enhance my skills. My commitment to knowledge growth extends beyond my professional life. As an avid guitar player, I have learned the values of discipline, patience, and the pure joy of mastering a new piece. This hobby serves as a creative outlet, providing a balance to my </em><em class="italic">technical pursuits.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Additionally, I enjoy contributing to open source projects, an experience that not only broadens my coding skills but also deepens my appreciation for the collaborative nature of our field. Integrity, collaboration, and the pursuit of excellence are my guiding principles, influencing both my personal and professional life. I am a hard-working individual with a unique blend of technical skills and creative flair, eager to make a significant impact in my </em><em class="italic">future role.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s break down the preceding text from an HR perspective:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">passion for technology</strong>: By stating that you’re a passionate<a id="_idIndexMarker024" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> technology enthusiast, you highlight that you’re not just in the field for a job, but because you genuinely enjoy what you do. This can suggest to HR that you are more likely to be motivated, dedicated, and continually improving in your role.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">A detail-oriented team player</strong>: Highlighting this quality indicates that you are conscientious and able to work well within a team, both of which are critical attributes in most work environments. This shows HR that you would likely fit well within the existing team dynamic.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">A continuous learner</strong>: Your emphasis on constant learning is a strong positive signal to HR. It shows that you are proactive, eager to expand your skills, and will likely stay up to date with the latest technologies and trends, contributing to the organization’s growth.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"> <strong class="bold">An interesting person</strong>: Mentioning your hobby of playing the guitar and contributing to open-source projects gives an insight into who you are outside of work. It adds a personal touch to your resume that can help HR to understand you better as a person. It can also demonstrate qualities such as discipline, patience, and creativity.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">A candidate of integrity, collaboration, and excellence</strong>: These stated values show that you are professional and principled, which can align well with the company’s culture and values. It indicates to HR that you have a strong work ethic and are committed to delivering high-quality work.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">A hard-working and creative individual</strong>: These traits give a quick snapshot of your work style. They suggest to HR that you would be committed to your role and can bring a creative perspective, both of which can be valuable to a company.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">While the About Me section<a id="_idIndexMarker025" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> is more personal, it should still align with the values and requirements of the job you’re applying for. You might want to slightly tweak it for each job application to emphasize the most relevant aspects of your personality and experiences. Next, let’s move on to the Skills section of the resume.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor019" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>The Skills section</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are some<a id="_idIndexMarker026" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> recommendations<a id="_idIndexMarker027" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> when crafting the <strong class="bold">Skills</strong> section of your resume:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Match the job description</strong>: Tailor your skills to the job description as closely as possible. If the job post lists specific technologies or methodologies and you have experience with them, be sure to include them.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Distinguish between hard and soft skills</strong>: Hard skills refer to specific technical knowledge<a id="_idIndexMarker028" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> and training while soft skills are more related to your behavior and how you interact with other people. Both are important and should be included.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Be honest</strong>: Don’t embellish or overstate your skills. If you’re not proficient in a particular technology, don’t claim to be. Honesty is always the best policy, and it’s better to learn on the job than to mislead an employer.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Don’t forget transferable skills</strong>: If you’re transitioning from a different career or industry, think about the skills you’ve gained that can be applied to the job you’re applying for. These could include project management, leadership, or communication skills.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Be concise but comprehensive</strong>: Aim to include a comprehensive list of your relevant skills but keep the descriptions concise. Each skill should ideally be described in a few words or a short phrase.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Consider the order</strong>: The order in which you list your skills can also be significant. Consider putting the most important and relevant skills at the top of the list.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Use action words</strong>: Begin each skill with an action word to make it more engaging. For example, instead of <em class="italic">experience with C#</em>, say <em class="italic">proficient </em><em class="italic">in C#</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Remember, the Skills section<a id="_idIndexMarker029" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> of your resume is your chance to showcase what you’re capable of, so make it as tailored and compelling as possible.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here’s an example of the Skills sections<a id="_idIndexMarker030" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> for a C# developer:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">C# programming</strong>: Expertise in core concepts, .NET types, Task Parallel Library (TPL), delegates, and events</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Frameworks</strong>: .NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, LINQ</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Database</strong>: Entity Framework, LINQ-to-SQL</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Tools</strong>: Visual Studio, NuGet, .NET debugging</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Testing</strong>: NUnit, MSTest</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">API development</strong>: ASP.NET Core Web API</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Having explored all the essential components <a id="_idIndexMarker031" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>of your resume, let us now delve into the next section to grasp the concept of a cover letter and learn the process of crafting one.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor020" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Drafting a cover letter</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">A <strong class="bold">cover letter</strong>, or an <strong class="bold">accompanying letter</strong>, is a document that is typically sent<a id="_idIndexMarker032" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> along with your resume<a id="_idIndexMarker033" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> when applying for a job. This letter gives you the opportunity to describe your experience, skills, and goals in more detail, as well as indicate why you are interested in the specific vacancy and why you consider yourself a suitable candidate.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are some key points to consider <a id="_idIndexMarker034" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>when writing a cover letter:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Addressee</strong>: Try to find out who will be reading your letter and address this person directly. If you do not know who this is, you can use a general salutation, such as <em class="italic">Dear Employer</em> or <em class="italic">Dear </em><em class="italic">Hiring Team</em>.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Introduction</strong>: In your introduction, you should indicate the position you are applying for and briefly describe why you are interested in this role.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Body</strong>: In this section, you should describe your experience, skills, and achievements that make you a suitable candidate for the specific vacancy in detail. You should demonstrate how your skills match the job requirements.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Conclusion</strong>: In the conclusion, you should thank the reader for their time and indicate your willingness to discuss your application in more detail in an interview.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"> <strong class="bold">Signature</strong>: Conclude your letter with a signature that includes your full name and contact<a id="_idIndexMarker035" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> information.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Here is an example of a cover<a id="_idIndexMarker036" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> letter for a C# developer:</p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Dear [company’s </em><em class="italic">name] Team,</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">I am writing to you regarding the C# developer position at your company that I saw on your website (link to the </em><em class="italic">job post).</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">As an experienced developer with a deep knowledge of C# and .NET Framework, I am very interested in </em><em class="italic">this opportunity.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Over the past five years, I have worked as a C# developer at XYZ Company, where I developed and implemented several high-performing web applications using ASP.NET </em><em class="italic">and SQL.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">I was responsible for the entire project development cycle, including requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, </em><em class="italic">and support.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">One of my biggest accomplishments was the creation of a web application for automating project management processes, which reduced task completion time </em><em class="italic">by 30%.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">I believe that my experience and skills will be a good fit for your team, and I look forward to the opportunity to help your company achieve </em><em class="italic">its goals.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application in more detail in </em><em class="italic">an interview.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Best regards,</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">[</em><em class="italic">Your Name]</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">[Your </em><em class="italic">Contact Information]</em></p>
			<p class="calibre3">From an HR manager’s perspective, here’s how<a id="_idIndexMarker037" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> this cover letter might be analyzed:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Opening</strong>: <em class="italic">Dear [company’s name] Team</em> is a good opening. It’s professional, friendly, and appropriately addresses the recipient.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">First paragraph</strong>: The writer provides a clear reason for writing the letter: they’re interested in the C# developer position at the company. Including the source of the job posting indicates a proactive approach.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Second paragraph</strong>: The writer mentions their experience and technical skills that are relevant to the role. It shows that they have read the job description and understand what is required for the position.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Third paragraph</strong>: They provide a detailed account of their past work experience and their responsibilities in their previous role. This gives the HR manager a glimpse of what they could potentially bring to the role in terms of skill set and experience.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Fourth paragraph</strong>: They discuss a specific achievement and quantify the result. This highlights their problem-solving skills and ability to deliver results. However, be cautious about including exact percentages if you can’t substantiate these claims in an interview.</li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor021" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Utilizing LinkedIn</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Currently, there are two most important platforms<a id="_idIndexMarker040" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> for development, namely <strong class="bold">LinkedIn</strong> and <strong class="bold">GitHub </strong>(we will cover GitHub in the next section). LinkedIn is your online CV, where you can write about yourself. Therefore, it’s crucial to pay attention to your profile. Let me remind you once again that your profile is the first and only thing a recruiter sees.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor022" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Creating a LinkedIn profile</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Your LinkedIn profile is an important tool<a id="_idIndexMarker041" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> for job hunting, networking, and professional development. Here are some tips on how you can fill out your profile as a developer:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Profile and background images</strong>: Your profile photo should be professional and friendly. The background image can reflect your work or interests in IT. This is important because photos provide the first impression of you.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Profile headline</strong>: This is one of the most important elements of your profile. It should clearly reflect your role and specialization, such as C# Backend Developer, JavaScript Developer, or Senior Python Developer. This helps employers and other professionals in the industry to quickly understand what you do.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Profile description</strong> (<strong class="bold">About</strong>): In this section, you can talk more about your skills, experience, and goals. Be clear and specific, focusing on what you can offer employers. You can include information about your professional interests, technologies used, teamwork features, and personal achievements.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Work experience</strong>: This is the section where you can detail your work in previous positions. For each position, indicate the company, time of work, your role, and important achievements or projects you worked on. Try to use an active voice and verbs to highlight your contribution.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Education</strong>: List your higher education, courses, or certificates related to your profession. This demonstrates your training and education in the field.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Skills</strong>: LinkedIn allows you to indicate skills you possess. Emphasize technical skills such as programming languages, databases, and testing as well as soft skills such as teamwork, organizational abilities, and critical thinking.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Recommendations</strong>: Ask your colleagues or managers to give you recommendations. They can point out your strengths and successes you achieved while working with them.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Volunteering and interests</strong>: If you have volunteering<a id="_idIndexMarker042" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> experience, especially related to IT, be sure to include it in your profile. Also, don’t forget to add your professional interests such as groups, organizations, or industry events you’ve joined.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Selective projects, publications, and patents</strong>: If you have relevant content, include it in your profile. These can be links to your GitHub projects, scientific works, medium articles, or other relevant works. This will allow you to showcase your real achievements and skills.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Languages</strong>: If you speak multiple languages, be sure to include them in your profile. This can be useful, especially if you’re interested in working for international companies.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">By following these recommendations, you’ll be able to create<a id="_idIndexMarker043" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> a detailed and attractive LinkedIn profile that reflects your professional experience, skills, and achievements. All these elements will help you attract the attention of employers and other professionals in the industry.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In the next section, I will show you an example of how you can structure your LinkedIn profile.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor023" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Structuring a LinkedIn profile</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Your resume is great, but think of LinkedIn<a id="_idIndexMarker044" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> as your resume that anyone can immediately write to you on! That’s why it’s also important to have a good LinkedIn profile and include a link to it everywhere. Treat it as the full version of your resume.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Creating an effective LinkedIn profile requires careful consideration of each section. Here’s an outlined structure that can serve as a good example:</p>

			<ol class="calibre15">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Increase connections</strong>: To add 500 connections or more, start by connecting with people you already know such as colleagues, classmates, and business partners.

			</ol>
			<p class="calibre3">Remember, your LinkedIn profile<a id="_idIndexMarker051" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> is like your online resume. By following these steps, you can enhance its appeal and make a strong professional impression. Next, we will move on to understanding how to utilize GitHub.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-25" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor024" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>Utilizing GitHub</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">If you’re a developer, it’s very important<a id="_idIndexMarker052" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> to have a profile on GitHub, but not an empty profile. It’s very good to add your projects and contribute to other projects because your code speaks for you better than any resume.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Your GitHub profile plays an important role in demonstrating your experience and skills as a developer. It’s a place where you can showcase your actual projects and code. Here are some tips on how you can fill out your C# developer profile:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Avatar and username</strong>: Use a professional photo<a id="_idIndexMarker053" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> for your avatar. Your username should be easy to understand and remember.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Biography</strong>: Provide a short biography that describes you as a professional developer. Include important information such as your main specialization (for example, C# Developer).</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Include a link to your LinkedIn profile or website</strong>: This will give others the opportunity to learn more about you and your professional experience.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Readme</strong>: GitHub allows you to create a <strong class="source-inline1">README</strong> file for your profile, which appears on the main page. You can use this file to describe your work, skills, projects you’ve joined, or any other information you consider important.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Repositories</strong>: Keep your repositories organized and updated. Each repository should have a quality <strong class="source-inline1">README</strong> file that describes the project, its functionality, how to install and use it, as well as how others can contribute.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Make your work visible</strong>: Add your projects in which you use C# to your repositories. Don’t be afraid to add projects that are still in development.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Join organizations</strong>: If you are a member of any GitHub organizations, they will be displayed on your profile. This can show your activity and collaboration in the programming field.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Contributions</strong>: Your activity on GitHub is reflected in a contributions graph. Try to be active: commit to your repositories, create branches, pull requests, and respond to issues.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Connect with other developers</strong>: Follow other developers you’re interested in and interact with them. You may learn something new or even find opportunities for collaboration.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Gists</strong>: You can use Gists to store and share small snippets of code. This can be useful for demonstrating specific<a id="_idIndexMarker054" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> skills or developing certain solutions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Remember that your GitHub profile is not just a place to store code – it’s your portfolio. It should showcase your skills, experience, coding style, and ability to work on projects.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The GitHub profile should be designed in such a way that it reflects your skills and experience in development. Here’s an example <a id="_idIndexMarker055" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/>of what a GitHub profile might look like for a C# developer:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Username</strong>: CSharpDeveloper123</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Bio</strong>: Experienced C# developer specializing in .NET Framework and ASP.NET. Passionate about problem-solving and continuous learning.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">The pinned section</strong>: This section allows you to showcase your best or most relevant repositories. As a C# developer, you might pin repositories that contain projects or contributions you’ve made related to C# or a .NET Framework.<p class="calibre3">For example:</p><ul class="calibre16"><li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">ASP.NET web application</strong>: A high-performance web application developed with ASP.NET and SQL for managing project workflows. This application improved productivity by 30% at XYZ Company.</li><li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">C# algorithms and data structures</strong>: A collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in C#. This repository serves as a reference and a demonstration of my problem-solving skills.</li><li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Open-source contribution</strong>: Contributed to ABC Open Source Project by improving the performance of the C# component. This improvement resulted in a 15% increase in the efficiency of the software.</li></ul></li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Activity overview</strong>: Make sure to keep your activity consistent. Regular contributions and interactions show that you are an active member of the GitHub community.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Contribution graph</strong>: This section automatically updates with your contributions to your projects and any other repositories on GitHub. A well-filled contribution graph indicates active engagement with coding and version control.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Followers, following, and stars</strong>: Engaging with other users by following them, starring their repositories, or collaborating on projects can demonstrate your involvement in the GitHub community.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Organizations</strong>: If you’re a part of any organization such as a company or open source project, they can be listed<a id="_idIndexMarker056" class="calibre6 pcalibre1 pcalibre"/> here.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Remember, your GitHub profile is an extension of your resume and LinkedIn profile. It’s an opportunity to showcase your coding skills, projects, and contributions in a way that can’t be conveyed through a traditional resume.</p>
