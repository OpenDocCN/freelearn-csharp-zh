                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction to Unity for AR Development</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">This chapter will introduce you to Unity, a real-time 3D development platform that has become one of the main tools for multi-platform <strong>Augmented Reality</strong> (<strong>AR</strong>) development. Its versatility, extensive documentation, and active forums allow for a fast learning curve, and the already created scenes, examples, and varied resources of its Asset Store will help you create amazing AR experiences in a fast and simple way.</p>
<p>The main goal of this chapter is that you get comfortable around Unity before using it in AR projects. You will learn how to install and use Unity, how the user interface is distributed, and the names and purpose of the main components. Then, you will create a simple C# script to understand the power of scripting to be able to customize 3D scenes. By the end of this chapter, you will have basic knowledge under your belt so that you can explore Unity further by integrating and working with the AR <strong>Software Development Kits</strong> (<strong>SDKs</strong>) we are going to introduce in the following chapters.</p>
<p>Unity is one of the most powerful tools in AR development; it's multiplatform and most of the AR SDKs have specific packages that are compatible with Unity. In this book, <a href="a35bc701-516c-47dc-abb1-f6494cacf5af.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>AR for Marketing with EasyAR</em>, <a href="3ef942da-7d11-444e-b3e9-ddbf24bb2d09.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>AR for Retail with Vuforia</em>, and <a href="4ee2c3b3-2856-4b78-a17c-5575cafafc3b.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>AR for Automation with Vuforia and Epson Glasses</em>, will be developed with Unity and although their example projects are implemented in Android devices, they can also be built (except for the Epson glasses, which only run with Android OS) for iOS devices with nearly zero code changes. Furthermore, <a href="2d2b4e6f-1ee8-46ab-9041-24e36d57f949.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>AR for Manufacturing with ARCore</em>, and <a href="4c04e2f4-ef78-4061-bf73-41777381d9ad.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>AR for Tourism with ARKit</em>, can also be implemented within Unity.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Thus, the importance of this introductory chapter, where you will learn how to create a Unity 3D project and build it for a specific platform, serving as the basis for more complex projects.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>

<p>Although we will develop our Unity projects for Android devices, you can also build them for iOS. In this case, the requirements would be a macOS and Xcode 9.4 or higher.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Introducing Unity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When we think of tools that we can use to develop video games that have had a great impact in recent years, one name stands out above all others: Unity. Unity is a graphics engine that helps us in developing video games, interactive projects, visualizations, and 2D and 3D animations in real-time for different platforms. Unity offers a complete visual editor with scripting so that we can create applications with a professional finish.</p>
<p>For this purpose, Unity is composed of a package of tools that have been designed to facilitate the tasks of designing and programming the different aspects of a video game, including graphics, physics, animations, and artificial intelligence. Unity is a unique development system that focuses on assets and not on the code like other similar 3D modeling applications do. The content of the game is built from the editor and the game is programmed using the C# scripting language. </p>
<p>Unity also includes a land editor, which is where you can create a terrain (such as a blank sheet) using visual tools, paint, or textures, and also add other elements that have been imported from 3D applications, such as Blender, 3ds Max, and Maya. </p>
<p>Unity has had rapid growth in the market as has been adopted by companies and professionals due to certain characteristics. These characteristics make Unity stand out from other game engines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity is a multi-platform tool that allows us to publish 2D and 3D content for multiple platforms, such as Windows, OS X, GNU/Linux, Flash, Xbox One, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Android, and iOS, including web-based games over <strong>Web Graphics Library</strong> (<strong>WebGL</strong>) technology (a standard specification for rendering 3D graphics in any web browser).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unity possesses a fully functional free license for learning purposes and for independent developers, as well as different scalable pricing plans according to the business volume of the developer companies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unity is one of the most popular engines for AR and <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> (<strong>VR</strong>) development, supporting the industry from an early stage. Around two-thirds of all AR and VR apps on the market have been built using Unity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unity is an extensible environment, which can be increased by our own or third-party plugins, and grows in a scalable way with new elements and functionalities that it wasn't originally created to handle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unity offers a portal that we can use to buy and sell all kinds of extensions and resources, both free and paid, called the Asset Store. This portal is not only useful for developers but also offers the business market the ability to create specific companies, whose business models are to create tools and content so that they can sell their own resources in this online store.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unity incorporates additional services, most of which are free, that allow us to generate profits in different business models of the video game world. Some of these services are, for example, Unity Ads, which allows you to add advertising; Unity Analytics, which provides information about the interaction of users; and Unity Networking, which provides infrastructure for the development of online games.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">Now that we understand what Unity is and its many features, we can start preparing our system so that we can install the necessary software.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Preparing your system for Unity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this book, we are going to use Unity to develop Android mobile applications. To create Android apps, we need to have the <strong>Java Development Kit</strong> (<strong>JDK</strong>) and Android <strong>Software Development Kit</strong> (<strong>SDK</strong>) installed.</p>
<p>As we mentioned in the <em>Technical requirements</em> section, we can easily run the same projects for iOS, provided that we run Unity on a macOS computer with Xcode. </p>
<p>Since Unity directly provides the Android SDK installation, we will install the JDK first and then proceed to install Unity on our computer.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing Java Development Kit (JDK)</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To install the JDK, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Oracle's download page at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html</a>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1963 image-border" src="img/2c0b5b86-d70d-4629-93ae-76dac2503b66.png" style="width:91.50em;height:66.42em;"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Ensure that you accept the Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for Java SE.</li>
<li>Select the latest Java SE Development Kit (in our case, this is the Java SE Development Kit 8u201).</li>
<li>Once downloaded, run the installation file and let it install JDK and JRE into their default folders.</li>
</ol>
<p>Starting with Unity 2019.2, the Unity installation allows you to install OpenJDK inside the Android Build Support options (see the <em>Installing Unity</em> section).</p>
<p>Now that you have installed the JDK, let's install Unity.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing Unity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We are going to install Unity using the Unity Hub, a tool that allows us to install and manage different versions of Unity on our computer. You can download the Unity Hub from <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download</a>. </p>
<p>Follow these steps to install Unity:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Download and install the Unity Hub.</li>
<li>Run the Unity Hub. The first time you do this, it will notify you that the license is missing, as shown in the following screenshot. Click on MANAGE LICENSE:</li>

<p>Signing into Unity</p>
<ol start="5">
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Now, select one of the license options and click DONE. (You can use Unity for free with the Personal license if you meet the requirements. If you don't, you have to purchase Unity Plus or Pro on their web page (<a href="https://store.unity.com">https://store.unity.com</a>):</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1730 image-border" src="img/4d4fc4ce-c83b-48f0-afec-ac75b66b88fc.png" style="width:82.58em;height:45.50em;"/></div>
<p>Selecting a license for the product</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Now, go back, click on the Installs tab, and then on ADD to add a new Unity installation:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1731 image-border" src="img/05740b8d-08c1-4d17-9eeb-f139fb051600.png" style="width:72.50em;height:49.75em;"/></p>
<p>Adding a new Unity version</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>In the pop-up window that appears, select the Unity Version you want to install and the modules to add. In our case, we're using the 2019.1.2f1 version and we will install Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 to code and Android Build Support and Android SDK &amp; NDK Tools to develop in Android, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1732 image-border" src="img/804e5691-6344-424b-b310-0f0929ca8004.png" style="width:79.08em;height:57.25em;"/></p>
<p>Choosing the Unity version and modules</p>
<p>Unity Hub always shows the latest compilation of each version. If you want to install a specific version, such as the one we are using here, you can find it and install it through the Hub from the Unity Archive: <a href="https://unity3d.com/es/get-unity/download/archive">https://unity3d.com/es/get-unity/download/archive</a>.</p>
<p>Starting with Unity 2019.2, a new option appears under Android Build Support so that you can directly install OpenJDK.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>If you plan to develop with Vuforia, which is what we will do in <a href="3ef942da-7d11-444e-b3e9-ddbf24bb2d09.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>AR for Retail with Vuforia</em>, and <a href="4ee2c3b3-2856-4b78-a17c-5575cafafc3b.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>AR for Automation with Vuforia and Epson Glasses</em>, check the Vuforia Augmented Reality Support option shown in the following screenshot. Then, click NEXT and finish the installation:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1733 image-border" src="img/016351da-2e4f-4e6d-8c47-02ad079a30f0.png" style="width:78.58em;height:57.42em;"/></p>
<p>Selecting Vuforia Augmented Reality Support</p>
<p>Most recent versions of Unity might not always support Vuforia. If you don't see Vuforia on the list, don't panic! It is because the latest version of Unity doesn't support it yet and an older version should be installed that supports Vuforia</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>When you've finished the installation, you will be sent back to the Installs window, where you will see the new version and the installed modules, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1734 image-border" src="img/1795e381-3742-4536-9c47-c9be6a3779df.png" style="width:66.17em;height:42.83em;"/></p>
<p>Installs window with the new Unity version</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>If during the installation process you forgot to add a module or you want to add it at a later date, you only have to click on the three dots button in the top right corner and select Add Modules, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1735 image-border" src="img/17152331-a8b5-4f1a-bccd-8387531d06e2.png" style="width:67.92em;height:40.00em;"/></p>
<p>Adding a new module after finishing the installation</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Now, click on the Projects tab. Here, we will create a new project by pressing on the NEW button, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1736 image-border" src="img/4ac2cd94-5b5f-4b96-8087-df4b029b3a06.png" style="width:77.08em;height:53.33em;"/></p>
<p>Creating a new project</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>We will create a 3D project (already selected). In the Settings panel, give the project a Name and set a Location, as shown in the following screenshot. Then, click on CREATE:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737 image-border" src="img/a19d7f32-8410-4ada-99f8-ff6ba7684f1d.png" style="width:60.92em;height:39.42em;"/></p>
<p>Setting up the new Unity project</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Unity will now open the new project and you can start working with it. If you close the Unity window, you can reopen the project by selecting it from Unity Hub's Projects window, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1738 image-border" src="img/896665ec-471a-4323-ba47-ff2a87680448.png" style="width:34.75em;height:12.42em;"/></p>
<p>The new project appears in the Projects window</p>
<p>And that's it. Now, you have installed Unity on your computer and your first project is open so that you can start working with it. In the next section, we will provide a tour of the Unity interface in order to see the possibilities Unity offers and how to use each tool.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Understanding the Unity interface</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The first time you open the Unity editor, you will see a layout with different bars and windows, similar to what can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1739 image-border" src="img/861f49c8-a515-45ea-969e-b45f38304c1a.png" style="width:160.00em;height:84.25em;"/></div>
<p>The initial Unity layout</p>
<p>At first glance, the Unity configuration slightly reminds us of 3D modeling tools, with the 3D scene in the middle, although it has more panels on the sides than modeling tools does. Although it can look a bit daunting to understand everything if you are not familiarized with 3D tools, the Unity interface is quite straightforward and has remained very much the same throughout the Unity versions. The main components that can be seen in the preceding screenshot are as follows (from top left to bottom right):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Toolbar</strong>: Here, we have the main buttons so that we can manipulate objects in the Scene view to test the scene.</li>
<li><strong>The Hierarchy window</strong>: The Hierarchy window shows the elements in the Scene view ordered hierarchically.</li>
<li><strong>The Scene view, Game view, and Asset Store window</strong>: These three tabs have different purposes. The Scene view shows all the elements in the 3D scene. The Game view shows, from the camera perspective, how the scene will look when built. The Asset Store window can be used to download packages and assets from the Unity Store so that we can include them in our project.</li>
<li><strong>The Inspector window</strong>: When an element is selected in the Hierarchy window or the Scene view, its features and components will appear in this window.</li>
<li><strong>The Project window and Console window</strong>: The former shows all the directories and files of the project that we can (or not) use in the scene, while the latter shows the log messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we're going to explore each component in detail and learn how to change this layout to our needs and tastes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Toolbar</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This Toolbar is fixed on the screen and allows us to access Unity's main features. It's divided into three sections: the tools to manipulate objects on the scene, the Game view controls, and a group of buttons to access Unity services and manage the layers and UI layout:</p>
<p>On the left-hand side, we can see the main tools that we can use to manipulate the Scene view and the objects on it. These are as follows:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Hand tool</li>
<li>Move tool</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rotate tool</li>
<li>Scale tool</li>
<li>Rect tool</li>
<li>Combined tool</li>
<li>Center/Pivot button</li>
<li>Local/Global button:</li>
</ul>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1740 image-border" src="img/003cf082-0bae-4a75-ab1d-d516b35cb702.png" style="width:30.50em;height:2.58em;"/></div>
<p>Buttons on the left of the toolbar</p>
<p>Let's take a look at these tools, one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hand tool</strong>: This is the navigation tool for the scene. It has three uses:
<ul>
<li><strong>Move</strong>: Left-click + Drag to move through the scene without altering any of its objects. A hand icon appears in the Toolbar and Scene view. <img src="img/04bbc9fc-8c03-4e57-a647-6926062082bc.png" style="width:1.92em;height:1.67em;"/></li>
<li><strong>Orbit</strong>: <em>Alt</em> + Left-click + Drag to orbit in the scene. An eye icon appears in the Toolbar and Scene view. <img src="img/09480e16-40c5-446c-9267-8992227b2343.png" style="width:1.92em;height:1.33em;"/></li>
<li><strong>Zoom</strong>: <em>Alt</em> + Right-click + Drag to zoom in and out of the scene. A magnifying glass icon appears in the Toolbar and Scene view. <img src="img/263a77fc-52ef-4dff-9899-6fdc257e944b.png" style="width:1.83em;height:1.58em;"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use move at any time by pressing the wheel of the mouse and dragging. You can also access zoom in and out, using the mouse scroll wheel.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Move tool</strong>: When this button is selected, you can move the objects on the scene into the three axes by dragging the corresponding arrow. You can also drag the small squares that appear on the intersection of the arrows to move the object into a plane (two axes) instead of a single axis:</li>
</ul>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1965 image-border" src="img/f7ad758b-282f-447d-92a6-37e2b06f3ae6.png" style="width:44.00em;height:18.58em;"/></div>
<p>Moving a 3D element</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rotate tool</strong>: When this button is selected, you can rotate the objects on the scene in the three axes by dragging the corresponding circle:</li>
</ul>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2025 image-border" src="img/d967dfeb-1ddf-470d-8db8-9ab9f4917f3d.png" style="width:46.00em;height:20.58em;"/></div>
<p>Rotating a 3D element</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale tool</strong>: When this button is selected, you can scale the objects on the scene in the three axes by dragging the corresponding arrow (ending on a small cube). You can also drag the central cube to scale the object uniformly on the three axes:</li>
</ul>

<p>Scaling a 3D element</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rect tool</strong>: The tools we have seen so far are thought to manipulate 3D models. The rect tool, however, is specifically used for the <strong>User Interface</strong> (<strong>UI</strong>) elements on the scene and it works in two dimensions. In the following screenshots, we are manipulating a button:
<ul>
<li>You can <em>move</em> a UI element by dragging it:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>All the guides appearing together to manipulate the object</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Center</strong>/<strong>Pivot button</strong>: When Center is selected, the translation, rotation, and scale operations will be performed from the object's center point. In the following screenshot, the camera and directional light have been selected and the guide appears in the center point of the resulting group. In this case, the camera and light <em>will rotate around that central point</em>:</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1969 image-border" src="img/eaab95bf-7fe9-45ce-a2e6-b402c3e551b6.png" style="width:39.50em;height:17.58em;"/></p>

<p>Global option selected</p>
<p>On the center of the Toolbar, we have the play, pause, and step buttons, which we can use to control the Game view:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-435 image-border" src="img/3e017b64-7603-4ff4-8ea8-c112f3fe726c.png" style="width:8.83em;height:2.67em;"/></div>
<p>Buttons on the center</p>
<p class="mce-root">On the right-hand side, we have some buttons that we can use to access Unity collaborate services, Unity cloud services (the cloud icon), our Unity Account, the Layers visibility menu, and the Layout menu. We will be using the Layout menu later in this section to create a custom layout for our projects:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-436 image-border" src="img/898876aa-bde3-4081-a956-4a34caa7b5f8.png" style="width:34.92em;height:2.42em;"/></div>
<p>Buttons on the right-hand side</p>
<p>Now that we have seen the functionality of the Toolbar, let's look at the Scene view.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Scene view</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Scene view is the window where you will interact with the current scene and the 3D world you are creating on it. Here, you will have all the content that forms the scene and you will be able to manipulate them visually using the commands on the Toolbar. With this view, we can navigate through the whole scene and see it from all its angles so that we can place the 3D objects and make sure they are in the correct position. In this view, we can also manipulate the UI elements. The main element we want to talk about in this window is the Gizmo, which is located on the top right-hand side of the window.</p>
<p><strong>T</strong><strong>he Gizmo</strong>: You can use the Gizmo to quickly change the view (Top, Bottom, Right, Left, Front, Back) and switch between Perspective and Isometric (orthographic) modes. When changing the view, the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> arrows in the Gizmo will be pointing in the direction of each axis:<br/></p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437 image-border" src="img/0f4cb8dc-8d77-486c-8262-ec1c7894f848.png" style="width:15.08em;height:5.17em;"/></div>
<p>Gizmo with different arrows on the Front, Top, and Right views</p>
<p>The little icon on the left-hand side of the view name shows whether it's a Perspective or Isometric (orthographic) view, as shown in the following screenshot. You can switch between them by clicking on the little icon:<br/></p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-438 image-border" src="img/9fbe05e7-32e2-4cd3-8a97-0b3f445af330.png" style="width:10.92em;height:6.00em;"/></div>
<p>Perspective and Isometric (Orthographic) views allow us to adjust the objects in the scene</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the Hierarchy window and how it works.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Hierarchy window</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This window is a hierarchical view of the elements in the Scene view, which are represented by their names. On the top, we will always have the scene, and all the objects we add to the scene will hang from it. In the following screenshot, we have different elements, with some of them (Cube, Canvas) containing more elements.</p>
<p>The hierarchical view allows us to easily find the elements and the relationships between them (parenting) that affect the way they behave. For example, if we move the Cube element, its child object, ChildOfCube, will move along with it. However, if we only want to move the ChildOfCube element, we would select it in the Hierarchy window and move it, without affecting its parent Cube. In terms of the <em>local/global</em> positioning we explained in the previous section, the children's local position, rotation, and scale will be relative to those of the father:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1973 image-border" src="img/627652ab-0521-45f1-a404-a432533525cb.png" style="width:112.25em;height:43.58em;"/></div>
<p>The Cube object being selected in the Hierarchy window and Scene view</p>
<div><p>We will also use this window to quickly add new elements by right-clicking on it and selecting the one we want to add to the scene.</p>
<p>On the other hand, objects in the scene can be selected by clicking on them in the Scene view or in the Hierarchy window. The latter is very useful when an object has multiple children since we can ensure that we are selecting the correct element. In the Scene view, they could be overlapping.</p>
</div>
<p>A quick tip: double-clicking on the name of an object in the Hierarchy window makes the scene zoom into that object.</p>
<p>The Scene view and Hierarchy window are the two windows we can use to manipulate the elements in a scene, that is, the elements that we will build into our device. Now, we are going to learn how the Inspector window works when one of the elements in the scene is selected.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Inspector window</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This window displays the properties and components of the currently selected object. From here, you will be able to edit, delete, and add new components to the object. Since the different objects in the scene will have different properties, the Inspector window will change accordingly to show the corresponding information in each moment. This window can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-439 image-border" src="img/7ce79143-5eca-4f7f-ae2f-0e7ffd5a95d3.png" style="width:42.92em;height:34.50em;"/></div>
<p>Two different Inspector windows for the Main Camera and a Cube</p>
<p>As shown in the preceding screenshot, every element in the scene will have a Transform component so that it can move, rotate, and scale that element in the scene. However, apart from this, the Main Camera and Cube elements of the image don't have more components in common. In the case of the camera, it has, as expected, a Camera component, while the Cube has a mesh, a renderer (to visualize the object), and a collider that marks the physical boundaries of such an object.</p>
<p>The components in the Inspector window can be maximized and minimized so that we can organize the view. This way, if we have many components in a GameObject, we only see the ones that we require at each moment. For that, we can use the small arrow next to each component, as shown in the following screenshot, where the same Main Camera has had its components collapsed:</p>
<div><img src="img/bee35c56-559e-40e8-92fb-e8d3f2a7c2d2.png" style="width:26.83em;height:8.00em;"/></div>
<p>The Main Camera with its components collapsed</p>
<p>Now, let's look at how the Project window works.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Project window</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This window shows all the assets that are available for your project. When you import a new asset into your project, it will appear on this window and, from here, you will be able to drag it into your scenes. It's a hierarchical view with files organized in folders:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1975 image-border" src="img/5187e2f4-64ce-4ba5-b9eb-1a45def43d17.png" style="width:32.58em;height:12.67em;"/></div>
<p>Project window displaying the main folders in the Assets folder</p>
<div><strong>Important!</strong> When building an application, not every asset that appears in the Project window will be built into it. Except for some special folders, which can be found here: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpecialFolders.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpecialFolders.html</a>. Assets are only included in the final bundle if they are connected to the scene (directly appearing on it, called from scripts, and so on).</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Now, we will take a look at the Game view, which, as we mentioned at the beginning of this section, is located in a tab next to the Scene view.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Game view</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This window shows how the scene has been rendered by the camera(s) in your world. You can use the play, pause, and step buttons from the Toolbar to play your scene and see how it will look when published:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1976 image-border" src="img/df18ffee-8f46-4628-97d1-b1a10968b72a.png" style="width:94.50em;height:43.17em;"/></div>
<p>The Button and Cube objects from the Main Camera object's perspective</p>
<div><strong>Important!</strong> Any change you make in play mode is temporary and <em>will disappear</em> once you quit this mode by clicking on the play button again. This is useful when you want to try different approaches (for example, object rotation or color) before selecting the one that suits you, but make sure you don't lose important work because you forgot to switch play mode off!</div>
<p>The tab next to this window is the Asset Store window. Let's take a look.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Asset Store window</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This window connects to the Unity Asset Store, which is where developers and designers upload their assets. You can download and import any asset from the Asset Store for your project from this window:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1978 image-border" src="img/e3362a62-1296-4456-a567-4d743168d462.png" style="width:36.83em;height:20.67em;"/></div>
<p>Asset Store window from within Unity</p>
<p>The Asset Store offers free and paid content, such as 2D and 3D models and scenes, audio files, templates, complete projects, and much more, all of which you can download and import directly into your projects. All of these assets make the process of creating a project easier and faster.</p>
<p>Last but not least, let's learn how the Console window works and what it is useful for.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Console window</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Here, you can find the log of your project. This window displays warnings, errors, and information logs about your project, as shown in the following screenshot. If you struggle while troubleshooting error codes, the Unity forums (<a href="https://forum.unity.com/">https://forum.unity.com/</a>) is a valuable tool so that you can search for similar cases and ask for help:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1979 image-border" src="img/26802d2a-1fef-41bb-883f-b848e9e39816.png" style="width:115.92em;height:24.33em;"/></div>
<p>The Console window displaying different types of information, warning messages, and errors</p>
<p>The main elements of this window and their functions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Clear button removes all messages except compilation errors. You will have to correct these errors before making any other changes to the current scene or playing it.</li>
<li>You can use Collapse to join the same messages into an only message line.</li>
<li>Use Clear on Play to delete all the messages the moment you hit the play button on the Toolbar.</li>
<li>Error Pause allows you to pause the execution of the scene when an error occurs.</li>
<li>Use the three buttons on the right-hand side to show/hide the different types of messages (information, warning, and error).</li>
</ul>
<p>By now, you should have pretty good knowledge of how the Unity interface works. Before going any further, however, we are going to learn how to change the layout configuration. It's simple and useful to customize the various windows according to our needs and tastes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Changing the layout</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Now that we've looked at the main windows and know how they function, the first thing we are going to do is change the disposition of these windows on the screen so that they fit our project's needs. For this book, we are going to use a modified version of the 2 by 3 layout, which will allow us to see the AR scene and game at the same time. However, once you are comfortable using Unity, feel free to select the layout that suits you the most.</p>
<p>For the modified version, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, select the 2 by 3 layout on the top right drop-down menu of the Toolbar, just above the Inspector window:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1980 image-border" src="img/4e2df74b-4596-4827-bc5e-92b3b3627aa7.png" style="width:32.25em;height:53.92em;"/></div>
<p>Selecting 2 by 3 on the Layout drop-down menu</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Then, drag the Project window so that it's below the Hierarchy window:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/a5a3fa37-2de5-426b-b679-d28b9bd3bcfe.png" style="width:76.00em;height:44.33em;"/></div>
<p>Dragging the Project window so that it's below the Hierarchy window</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Select the list view on the Project window by dragging the bottom scrollbar all the way to the left:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/d8059468-7320-4650-95d0-aaf9d96b71c2.png" style="width:20.75em;height:13.83em;"/></div>
<p>Moving the horizontal scrollbar to the left</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Create a new aspect ratio of the Game view called <kbd>1280 x 720</kbd> and insert the following values: Width: <kbd>1280</kbd>, Height: <kbd>720</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-443 image-border" src="img/0c5cf391-80ea-4266-813f-b40ddf7492ba.png" style="width:88.83em;height:30.08em;"/></div>
<p>Creating a new Aspect Ratio</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Open the Console window, press <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>C</em> or<em> </em>Window|General|Console and drag it so that it's a tab beside the Game view:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-444 image-border" src="img/f688d09d-bff7-47e4-b8cd-ee459a985d90.png" style="width:35.67em;height:5.17em;"/></div>
<p>Dragging the Console window next to the Game view</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Finally, to ensure this layout is available every time you open Unity, go to Layouts, select Save Layout..., and give it a name:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/c3654394-5e84-4152-a814-13cb3d7a7221.png" style="width:23.92em;height:10.25em;"/> </div>
<p>Saving the created layout</p>
<p>Now, we have our layout ready so that it can be used in our AR projects. By now, you should be acquainted with the different windows and tools Unity offers and how they work. In the next section, we will take a look at the main elements we can find in a Unity project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Unity's main elements</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>An application built in Unity will be made up of a project. This project will contain all the necessary elements that we'll need in order to develop the application, such as models, scripts, plans, menus, and much more. When you start up Unity, you can open a project by pointing to its root folder. </p>
<p>Each project contains one or more documents, called <strong>scenes</strong>. The projects that are created in Unity are structured into scenes, where a scene can be any part of the project. When we talk about applications, a scene can be from the start menu to any level or area of it. A single scene will contain many elements, such as a user interface, 3D objects, scripts, and so on.</p>
<p>Some of the main elements you can find in a Unity project are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assets</li>
<li>GameObjects</li>
<li>Components</li>
<li>Scripts</li>
<li>Prefabs</li>
</ul>
<p>First, we will look at Assets.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Assets</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Unity refers to the files that will be used to create your project as an <strong>asset</strong>. They are the building blocks inside a Unity project and they can be in the form of image files, 3D models, sound files, code files, and so on. Assets from Unity, such as materials, textures, animations or scripts can be created in a <em>project</em> by either clicking on Assets|Create on the top menu bar or by right-clicking inside a folder on the Project window and selecting Create.</p>
<p>When we work with external assets, such as an image that's been downloaded from the internet or a 3D model we've designed, we can add them to the project by dragging them from an external folder (for example, from a folder on Windows Explorer) into one of the folders of the Project window or by right-clicking inside a folder of the Project window and selecting Import New Asset....</p>
<p>Use one of these methods to add <em>two</em> images from your computer gallery to the project's <kbd>Assets</kbd> folder (we will be using one now and the other later), as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>Adding an image to the project</p>
<p>Another way to import assets is to import a whole package containing several assets through Import-Package. This option can be found in the Assets menu of the menu bar or by right-clicking on the Project view.</p>
<p>To delete an asset from your project, right-click on it and press Delete. It's important to notice that, once you delete an asset from the project, you can't recover it again.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at what GameObjects are.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">GameObjects</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When an asset is used in a scene, it becomes a GameObject. GameObjects can be added to the scene by either clicking on GameObject on the top menu bar or by right-clicking in the Scene view or Hierarchy window. </p>
<p>Use one of these methods to add a 3D Object|Cube to the scene and move it so that it's in front of the Main Camera and is visible in the Game view:</p>

<p>Creating a Cube in the Hierarchy window</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about components.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Components</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Components come in different forms and they are in charge of adding functionality to GameObjects. They can be used to create behavior (for example, scripts), define the appearance of GameObject (for example, renderers), and influence other aspects of the function of an object in the project. </p>
<p>All GameObjects contain at least one component. We start with the Transform component. This component is in charge of telling the Unity engine the position, rotation, and scale of an object. Other common component elements include Renderer and Collider. We will be looking at their uses in the upcoming chapters in this book.</p>
<p>Components are added to a GameObject by selecting the object and then clicking on the Component menu of the menu bar or by hitting the Add Component button on the Inspector window.</p>
<p>Components can also be dragged from the Project window into the GameObject (for example, you can drag a script from the Project window onto a cube on the Scene view and the script will automatically appear in the Inspector window).</p>
<p>Drag one of the images you added to the Project window previously into the cube of the Scene view to convert it into a texture:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1985 image-border" src="img/951ea1fb-f939-45c9-b9f0-d32882129ca6.png" style="width:54.08em;height:45.75em;"/></div>
<p>The cube in the scene with the image as a texture</p>
<p>Now that we know about the visible elements of a project, let's talk about the invisible ones: the scripts.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Prefabs</h1>
                
            
            
                
<div><p>Prefabs are GameObjects with customized properties and components (for example, a light with a script added to it to make it blink) that you can store in your Project window so that you can reuse them in different scenes/moments. They can be created or copied at any time (including runtime) and, whenever you alter a property of the original prefab, unless otherwise defined, all its instances will be updated automatically.</p>
</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Scripts</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Scripts, which are actually a type of component, are an essential part of Unity since they define the behavior of the different elements in the project. You can manipulate (add/edit/delete) a script like any other component.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Right-click on the Project window and press Create|C# Script to create a new script and give it a name (for example, <kbd>CubeHandler.cs</kbd>):</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1984 image-border" src="img/2f324d1b-bc14-4717-bbab-9dfc83992cb4.png" style="width:34.33em;height:53.75em;"/></div>
<p>Creating a new script</p>
<p>In the Inspector window, you'll see that the newly created script has some default code in it. We'll talk about this code in the next section. Now that we have knowledge about the different elements of unity, let's learn to script in the following section.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Scripting – first example in C#</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To see all the potential of scripts in Unity, we are going to take a look at the script we created in the previous section, <kbd>CubeHandler.cs</kbd>. As its name suggests, we are going to add some code to it to manipulate the cube in the scene.</p>
<p>Double-click on the name of the script in the Project window to open it in Visual Studio.</p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">If you already had Visual Studio installed on your computer before you installed Unity, it's possible that Unity won't detect it automatically when double-clicking on the script. If so, you'll have to go to Edit|Preferences and go to External Tools. From there, select the path to the <kbd>.exe</kbd> file of Visual Studio:</p>
<div><img src="img/3be1bccb-d3e3-45ea-9049-e150c29f6fb8.png" style="width:60.00em;height:37.58em;"/></div>
<p>Preferences window with Visual Studio assigned as the External Script Editor</p>
<p>Upon opening the script, you will see the following auto-generated code:</p>
<pre>using System.Collections;<br/>using System.Collections.Generic;<br/>using UnityEngine;<br/><br/>public class CubeHandler : MonoBehaviour<br/>{<br/> // Start is called before the first frame update<br/> void Start()<br/> {<br/> <br/> }<br/><br/> // Update is called once per frame<br/> void Update()<br/> {<br/> <br/> }<br/>}</pre>
<p class="mce-root">The first three lines are the calls to three references. The first two are commonly used collections, while the third one is the reference that we need so that we can work with the Unity engine.</p>
<p>Then, you have the class declaration. The name of the class must be the same as the <kbd>.cs</kbd> script. By default, the classes that are generated through Unity will inherit from <kbd>MonoBehaviour</kbd>, which allows us to use the following two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <kbd>Start</kbd> method, which is called automatically as soon as the Unity scene is generated and before the first frame update. Therefore, this method is useful when it comes to initializing variables.</li>
<li>The <kbd>Update</kbd> method is called once per frame, meaning that the code inside this method will be executed repeatedly. </li>
</ul>
<p>Let's try to add some code to control the cube on the scene:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we are going to declare a variable called <kbd>speed</kbd>, just after the declaration of the class, and before the <kbd>Start</kbd> method:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">private float speed;</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Then, we are going to initialize the value of <kbd>speed</kbd> in the <kbd>Start</kbd> method:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">void Start()<br/>{<br/>    speed = 0.5f;<br/>}</pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Finally, we are going to use this variable in the <kbd>Update</kbd> method to tell the cube to rotate at a certain speed:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">void Update()<br/>{<br/>     transform.Rotate(Vector3.up * speed);<br/>}</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This last line accesses the <kbd>transform</kbd> component of the current GameObject element, which is in charge of its position, rotation, and scale. We are telling the <kbd>transform</kbd> component that we want to rotate the object in the vertical axis (<kbd>Vector3.up</kbd>) with the speed we set previously. </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>By itself, the script won't do anything because it doesn't know which object's transform we are referring to. To tell the script which objects from the scene we want to manipulate, go back to the Unity editor and drag the script onto the cube. Make sure that it appears as one of its components in the Inspector window. This way, we are telling the script that it's the Cube we want to rotate. The full code should look as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">using System.Collections;<br/>using System.Collections.Generic;<br/>using UnityEngine;<br/><br/>public class CubeHandler : MonoBehaviour<br/>{<br/>    private float speed;<br/>    public Texture2D texture;<br/><br/>    // Start is called before the first frame update<br/>    void Start()<br/>    {<br/>        speed = 0.5f;<br/>    }<br/><br/>    // Update is called once per frame<br/>    void Update()<br/>    {<br/>        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up * speed);<br/>    }<br/>}</pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Now, if you press the play button on the Toolbar, the Game view will show the cube rotating:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1987 image-border" src="img/b2a5ce0d-b383-4aa4-ae77-66004f4d0ea1.png" style="width:96.08em;height:81.17em;"/></div>
<p>When playing the scene, the cube will start rotating</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Press play again to stop the simulation. Try changing the value of the <kbd>speed</kbd> to see how it affects the rotation speed of the cube.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <kbd>transform</kbd> component is a little special because it has its own name. To access any other component, we need to use the <kbd>GetComponent&lt;ComponentName&gt;()</kbd> function. As an example, we can use this if we want to change the texture of the cube (the image we dragged into it previously). The component that's in charge of materials and textures is the <kbd>Renderer</kbd>. Let's include this code in our script:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, add the following line of code below the speed definition, which declares a variable of the <kbd>Texture2D</kbd> type:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">public Texture2D texture;</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Now, add the following two lines to the <kbd>Update</kbd> method, which is below the transformed line:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.A))<br/> GetComponent&lt;Renderer&gt;().material.mainTexture = texture; </pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Here, we are saying that, if the system detects that the <em>A</em> key has been pressed, the texture of the object's <kbd>Renderer</kbd> component will change to the new one. As you can see, in this case, we haven't initialized the texture in the <kbd>Start</kbd> method. Instead, we have made it <kbd>public</kbd> and we are going to assign it from within Unity.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Go back to the Unity editor. You will see that a new line has been added to the script component in the Inspector window. To assign the other image to it, you can either drag it from the Project window or click on the circle on the right and select it from the project:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1988 image-border" src="img/454f3260-a5d7-4e4c-bbcc-9619e2d1dc4d.png" style="width:38.42em;height:46.17em;"/></div>
<p>The last component of the cube is the script with the new line for selecting a Texture</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now, press play again. When the cube is rotating, press the <em>A</em> key. You will see how the texture of the cube changes:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1990 image-border" src="img/dbb0a14f-e843-4c88-98be-63dad572bd49.png" style="width:95.50em;height:78.42em;"/></div>
<p>Pressing the A key on the keyboard to see the texture of the cube change</p>
<p class="mce-root">Now, you know about all of the logic behind a Unity project and have the basis to create more complex scripts. In the upcoming chapters, we will be using scripts for purposes such as showing elements in AR or interacting with the user through the user interface.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we learned how to install Unity and the necessary modules to make it work so that we can build mobile applications. We also introduced how the Unity interface is designed, its main windows, and how to customize their composition for our needs. We took a look at the main windows, their tools, and how to use them. Then, we learned about the main elements we can find in a Unity project and how to create/import them. Finally, we created our first script with a few lines of code to understand how easily we can control and alter objects on a scene.</p>
<p>In the next chapter and the ones that follow, we will work with all of the elements we learned about in this chapter in order to generate fully functional AR projects.</p>
