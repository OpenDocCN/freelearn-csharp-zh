			<p class="author-quote">“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.”</p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Martin Golding</p>
			<p>In the world of software, there are so many things that can go wrong and often do go wrong. We’re a relatively young industry that is in an ever-changing state. Things haven’t settled and innovation happens at lightning speed. It’s not like carpentry, which has had a few thousand years of experience of what works and what doesn’t. In software, we’re still inventing the tools and reinventing them as we go. The business benefit and the possibility to increase productivity for our end users sets the expectations high and in an increasingly competitive market, time to market is of the essence.</p>
			<p>At the level we write our software today, we have a huge potential to leverage the metadata surrounding our own code to ensure the quality and maintainability of the software we write. This is where the metaprogramming journey starts.</p>
			<p>Metaprogramming can be really fun to work with, but it represents true opportunities for developers and businesses to set themselves apart. Things that metaprogramming can do for you include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Improve the maintainability of your code</li>
				<li>Automate tedious tasks</li>
				<li>Let developers focus more on your business and not the plumbing</li>
				<li>Help you stay more compliant</li>
				<li>Reduce risk related to security</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are technical reasons to dive into metaprogramming, as with any other technique, but I think there is true value to be discovered in leveraging it to help you and your team become more productive and, at the end of the day, deliver more business-critical features that are easier to change and maintain over the years.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>The book is for any C# developer who is curious about metaprogramming and what it could do for you. More specifically, the following personas are the target audience:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Developers who are familiar with C# and .NET as a runtime looking to expand their horizons and learn in more depth about the .NET runtime and compiler capabilities</li>
				<li>Software architects familiar with C# and .NET and looking for inspiration on how to improve their architecture</li>
				<li>CTOs or development managers with either a developer background or who understand software development and want inspiration to potentially grease the wheels of the developer organization</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B19418_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">How Can Metaprogramming Benefit You?</em>, dives into what metaprogramming is and how it can improve developers’ day-to-day work. It gives some concrete basic examples to explain its capabilities.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Metaprogramming Concepts</em>, provides explanations of the differences between implicit and explicit metadata through concrete examples. In addition, it gives an insight into how the .NET runtime works.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Demystifying through Existing Real-World Examples</em>, shows how Microsoft, as an example, leverages metaprogramming and how you probably already use it.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor059"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Reasoning about Types Using Reflection</em>, provides an overview of how powerful the .NET runtime reflection is and how its implicit metadata can be leveraged.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor083"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Leveraging Attributes</em>, introduces leveraging C# attributes as an explicit metaprogramming technique and how it can be used, giving real-world applicable examples.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor098"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Dynamic Proxy Generation</em>, introduces code that generates code, at runtime. A powerful concept that can really boost your developers’ productivity if used wisely.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor118"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Reasoning about Expressions</em>, provides an introduction to C# and .NET expression trees, how they represent a different aspect of metadata, and how they can be reasoned about and unpacked in your code.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Building and Executing Expressions</em>, provides an introduction to how you can build your own expressions at runtime and how these can be executed – an alternative technique to generating code.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor146"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Taking Advantage of the Dynamic Language Runtime</em>, covers what the Dynamic Language Runtime is and how it can be used to dynamically generate code – yet another alternative for your code is to create code.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor162"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Convention over Configuration</em>, unravels the superpower of conventions – code that repeats the patterns you probably already have, enabling your developers to become more productive and your code base to become more consistent.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor177"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Applying the Open-Closed Principle</em>, provides a dive into how you can create code bases that are open to extension but closed for modification – a powerful principle for maintainable software, using metaprogramming as an angle into it.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor196"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Go Beyond Inheritance</em>, provides another level on top of regular conventions, giving developers an opportunity to not just be limited by what the programming language offers, aiming for readability and maintainability.</p>

			<p><a href="B19418_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor250"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Roslyn Compiler Extensions</em>, details the basics of what the .NET compiler SDK offers and how to get started with it, serving as the basis for the following chapters.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Generating Code</em>, provides an introduction to how you can generate code using code at the compiler level before you enter runtime – yet another great way to improve your developers’ productivity and provide consistency in your code base.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor299"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 17</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Static Code Analysis</em>, provides an introduction to how you can build your own rules that perform analysis on any code being added to your project, helping you create consistent, uniform, and more maintainable code.</p>
			<p><a href="B19418_18.xhtml#_idTextAnchor323"><em class="ita ic">Chapter 18</em></a>, <em class="ita ic">Caveats and Final Words</em>, looks into what the book has covered, what benefits there are, and what caveats there are.
