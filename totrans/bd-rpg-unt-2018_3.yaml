    The `Update()` function is called every frame, and is used regularly to update
    the moving of non-physics objects, simple timers, and input processing. The update
    interval time varies for the `Update()` function. `FixedUpdate()` is called every
    physics step. The interval is consistent and used for adjusting physics on Rigidbody.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the `FixedUpdate()` function, we get the inputs for our Horizontal and Vertical
    axes, we calculate the *speed* value, and set the parameters defined in the Animator
    Controller using the `animator.SetFloat()` function. These parameters are then
    used by the animator controller to decide which state the character is at.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, to go from an idle state to the walking state, the *speed* parameter
    needs to be greater than 0.1, and from walking to running, the *speed* parameter
    will need to be greater than 0.6, and the *run* parameter needs to be true. The
    opposite is true when you want to go back from the running state to the walking
    state and from the walking state to the idle state. The Horizontal and Vertical
    parameters control the movement for turning left or turning right. All these three
    parameters combined control what state and what animation the character is rendering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next step is for us to enable the *Jump*, Die and *Attack* states. The Jump
    state can be entered while the character is idle or running and the Jump Boolean
    variable is set to true. The jump condition is set in the `Update()` function
    when the space bar is pressed by the player. This sets the variable to true and
    passes the variable to the animator controller.
  prefs: []

    the following keys on the keyboard: *C* and *P*. Each one will set its Boolean

    these states from the Any state. We will leave it as is for now.'
