    consolidated among developers for having a friendly user experience, good support
    with regular updates, and powerful tools for writing clean and scalable code.
    VS has support for many technologies and platforms. For many developers, VS is

    version was created to work with Visual Basic 6.0\. Then, in 2002, a new version
    was released, which included compatibility with **.NET** and **C#** (a new programming

    or midsize applications, and other versions at a cost for professional developers,
    large companies, or for those who want to use advanced tools.
