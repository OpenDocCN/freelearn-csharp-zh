The whole point of having a game designer in a team is to ensure that someone is taking care of putting everything about the game in black and white—someone able to define and communicate ideas, mechanics, and any other information the team might need to know in order to develop the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Many novice game designers (and game developers in general) look online or ask friends in the industry for a game design document template that they can use as a starting point for writing their own documentation. The general misconception is that <span class="italic">if it worked for someone else, it will do for me</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">As opposed to a game concept document, where there are established rules and information that must be included in a certain way (due to the <span class="italic">selling purpose</span> nature of the document), a GDD doesn't follow a determined structure or format, and the information it contains can greatly vary depending on the game, on the work methodology and on the team size and dynamics.</p><p class="calibre_2">If you search online for a GDD template, what you are most likely to find is a classic standard template. Probably it was made in Word, probably 10 to 20 years ago. The template usually contains an outline that game designers are supposed to fill with their content, a document, that once filled, will most certainly reach at least 100 pages, if not more. A monolithic bible with all the possible information you can imagine. One that no one is going to read, not even yourself. It contains chapters such as character descriptions, input controls, dialogues, and an art assets list.</p><p class="calibre_2">Game development has changed quite a lot since that kind of document template was released. What if your game doesn't have any dialogues? Or there are no characters at all? What if the input controls can only be described in association with a specific mechanic (for example, swiping for matching candies in <span class="italic">Candy Crush Saga</span>)? What if you're working on a huge game and filling all that information would require months which you don't have? Or maybe you're part of a team of designers and each needs to start working on a different aspect of the game at the same time? How can you work on the <span class="italic">art assets list</span> if you don't even know what the level designer is going to include in his or her levels?</p><p class="calibre_2">All these queries caused a sort of crisis of GDDs in modern game development when the very usefulness of producing such documentation was questioned by many developers.</p><p class="calibre_2">Luckily for us, we can say that the crisis has been now resolved. The answer is that no one needs that kind of game design document anymore. But of course, a GDD is essential to any project that aims to be successfully released. The secret lies in the fact that no template is good for your game. Every GDD is unique and the format and tools and techniques are simply the ones that work for you, your team, and the project. Reading those old templates, or even GDD examples released by developers, is still a useful exercise, one that I sincerely recommend. But when the time comes to write your GDD, use what you have learned from those templates and make sure you are building a document that serves your purposes, instead of one that covers all the bullets point made by someone else for a completely different project.</p><p class="calibre_2">As you will have guessed by now, in this chapter we won't focus on what to write in a game design document. Instead, I'm going to provide a series of tools and techniques you can use to write your own document, in a way that works for you.</p><p class="calibre_2">The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">The purpose of a GDD</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">The characteristics of a good GDD</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">The tools available for creating GDD with pros and cons for each of them</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">A list of useful writing techniques</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Elegance in game design</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Maintaining a GDD</li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_195"/>


<div id="filepos298112" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">What is the purpose of a GDD?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Documentation serves two purposes:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Providing the team with a detailed description of what needs to be done (communication)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Acts like a sort of encyclopedia of the game, where the team can keep track of what has been done and how, and what has changed (memory)</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">This means that the job of the game designer is not only to spec out the game on paper before any software is written, but also to ensure that everything that is written must be up to date. Whenever something changes down the line, or it is not implemented exactly as per documentation, it is important that the doc is updated. A great practice is to add comments about why (and how) the final implementation is different from the initial design. This kind of thing happens all the time in game development. In fact, no game designer has ever handed his document to the rest of team without being asked to modify or remove something that could be implemented in a better way or cannot be implemented at all. Like we said, game design is an iterative process, and writing documentation is no different.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_197"/>

<div id="filepos301094" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">It is modular</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Generally speaking, the goal of the document is to communicate the game design to all the parties involved in game development. But it's very unlikely that the whole design is going to be covered by a single document. Some parts of the game might need to be designed as soon as possible, while others might wait for a later stage or even need to be designed after some of the features have been implemented.</p><p class="calibre_2">A development team can reach over 200 people in AAA productions and many people will have a very specific role. Imagine if a programmer in charge of developing the multiplayer network was forced to read a 1,000-page document to understand what they needs. They will get information about levels, characters, storyline, or the balancing of the combat system… all stuff they doesn't need to understand to actually jump on what they needs to know.</p><p class="calibre_2">Ideally, there would be a chapter just for him called <span class="italic">Multiplayer</span>. Even better, there would be an entirely separate document called <span class="italic">Multiplayer</span>. If this, let's say, 50-page document contains all the information the programmer needs, with fewer possible dependencies on other features or documents, we can call it a GDD in itself or a module.</p><p class="calibre_2">A game document should always be modular.</p><p class="calibre_2">What does modular mean? Let's get more technical and look at how modularity is defined for software development by Wikipedia:</p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">"Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality."</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Just like modular software, a modular GDD should be composed of different modules as independent and interchangeable as possible. Remember that video games are software and as such they can (and should) make good use of software development techniques at every level, not only for coding. Unlike software, though, it's very unlikely that a video game is going to be made of parts fully independent of each other. Removing one part of the game, or changing its design, will have an impact on the others, and without one part, the entire game might fall apart and not work as intended any more. However, that is exactly why you need to keep the GDD organized in modules. If something needed to change, you'd need the confidence of knowing which part to rework and exactly how and where it is referenced elsewhere in your documentation.</p><p class="calibre_2">Here's a very simple example: you have designed a combat system in an action game. Following the practice of modularity, you have created a separate document called <span class="italic">Combat System</span>, just for that feature, where all the details are meticulously designed. In other modules of the GDD, every time you have to reference a particular mechanic in the combat system, you simply point at the specific document on that topic. Let's say at some point during production, something in the combat system must change drastically. If your references to the combat system document are very few and always in a form like s<span class="italic">ee combat system document for details</span>, all you'd have to do is make the required changes in that module only, and all the references will remain relevant.</p><p class="calibre_2">As we discussed, GDD is by definition a live document, so it will need constant updates and changes, and sometimes entire parts may be cut out or added. Modularity ensures that taking out or changing a module doesn't mean going back and updating the entire documentation. Most importantly, it guarantees that a change in one feature doesn't impact the rest of the game, or if it does it gives control over where the dependencies are. Modularity ensures another important concept inherited from software development: <span class="italic">reusability</span>. A modular GDD is reusable because every single module can be used for different projects (if conveniently adapted). Writing a modular GDD means for you, the game designer, creating a library of designs for a variety of game features and mechanics that is easy to consult, examine, and improve throughout your entire career.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Don't worry too much about creating a spectacular-looking GDD every time. The goal is to communicate in the best and most efficient way, not to show how pretty your documentation is. Reusing previous work (without violating any property rights) means not losing time reinventing the wheel and focusing more attention on what's new or different.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_201"/>


<div id="filepos306234" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">It starts with goals and requirements</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">What is the goal of what you're about to write? What do you need to achieve and what kind of requirements are there? Some of the requirements and goals of the entire game have been already specified in the game concept, but with the GDD we are stepping deeper into the game. Therefore, we need to define goals and requirements for each different module.</p><p class="calibre_2">Let's have a look at a practical example.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Hearthstone</span> is a famous <span class="bold">Collectible Card Game</span> (<span class="bold">CCG</span>). When it was initially released in March 2014 the game was strictly multiplayer, with only PvP matches available (and a shallow single-player mode to test out card decks). After a few months, the Adventure mode was released, offering a single-player experience to Hearthstone players.</p><p class="calibre_2">What goals and requirement could have been set for it?</p><p class="calibre_2">If you know the game, try to make a list before reading further, and then compare your ideas with our list.</p><p class="calibre_2">The set goals might look like these:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Offer a single-player experience to Hearthstone players</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Introduce new cards and game boards</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Keep non-competitive players engaged with the game</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Expand the setting with storytelling</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">The requirements could be:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Keep the game accessible (avoid introducing too much new content/too many new mechanics)</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Versatile system to periodically introduce new adventures</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Keep the old cards in balance with the new</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Adhere to the Warcraft settings guidelines</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Of course, these are not the official goals and requirements that Blizzard set for the development of the first <span class="italic">Hearthstone</span> adventure, <span class="italic">Curse of Naxxramas</span>, but that's how I would spec them out.</p><p class="calibre_2">We already mentioned how important requirements and constraints are to creativity.

Having a fixed structure to follow is always a great idea to start with!</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_203"/>


<div id="filepos309420" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Is the result of a discussion</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Once goal and requirements are defined, and some ideas have popped into your mind, it's time to have an early confrontation with other designers or the rest of the team that will be in charge of developing the feature.</p><p class="calibre_2">It's never early enough to share ideas! The earlier you start brainstorming and sharing, the earlier you'll be able to catch pitfalls in your design or evolve your ideas to a more effective level.</p><p class="calibre_2">Don't think that this part belongs to you. What you are thinking might be not feasible for technical reasons you're not aware of. Get the rest of the team involved!</p><p class="calibre_2">Game programmers are the most important interlocutors at this point. They are the ones who will implement your design. You want to get them involved in the creative process and you want to make sure they know what they are going to work on before giving them the final document.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Brainstorming is an invaluable technique you need to master. There are no too crazy ideas during brainstorming; you have to stay open to criticism from others but avoid doing the same yourself and to anything that comes to mind. Rationalizing them and deciding what to use or not will come after the session. Wikipedia (</span></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming"><span class="calibre4"><tt class="calibre5"><span class="italic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming</span></tt></span></a><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">) offers great insights on brainstorming that are worth reading.</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="calibre_2">It's only after you have interrogated your ideas and designs with others that you'll finally be able to decide what to write. Remember that everything you'll be writing will be transformed into software and will require a lot of work by many different people. You don't want to get it wrong. Small mistakes and imprecision can trigger an <span class="italic">avalanche</span> effect that can translate into a massive waste of work for the team down the line. Again, this doesn't mean that everything must be written like in an instruction manual, but whatever you decide to write down needs to reduce confusion and ambiguities, not create more! If something cannot be precisely defined at this stage, don't be afraid to write that into the document!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_205"/>


<div id="filepos312080" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Is clear, brief, and concise</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A game designer can produce a lot of documentation, going into the finest details and exploring all the possible scenarios, but a document is useless if no one reads it. And a very long, too-specific document that requires hours of study and reading is most likely counterproductive.</p><p class="calibre_2">Clarity means that the reader doesn't have to put in too much effort to read and understand what you're saying. It means going straight to the point and writing only what's necessary. It also means that it is comprehensive and covers all the necessary details. Game documentation is neither an essay nor an instruction manual.</p><p class="calibre_2">A bullet point, such as a to-do list, is most likely too concise (although, it might work for very simple games), but on the other hand a lengthy text detailing too many irrelevant details or too-technical details won't do any good. If describing a feature takes more than a dozen pages, you probably need to split the feature into sub-features and describe them in different documents.</p><p class="calibre_2">Maybe you're working on the design of a guild system for an MMO, which might sound like a single feature, but it will turn out to be massive, as it usually includes social interactions, guild quests, guild versus guild systems, and maybe guilds halls. You should never tackle all that in a single document.</p><p class="calibre_2">Using weak statements, or words such as <span class="italic">could</span>, <span class="italic">might</span>, or <span class="italic">should</span>, contributes to creating a sense of confusion in the reader, so avoid using those!</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_207"/>


<div id="filepos313942" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Is multimedial</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A GDD is not just text. <span class="italic">A picture is worth a thousand words</span>, including sketches, concept art, reference pictures, or even examples from other video games (which could easily be in video format). These are great ways to convey information about how a specific system should work. In particular, using existing video games as a reference is perfectly fine.</p><p class="calibre_2">It is unambiguous and can save both the designer and the reader a lot of time. There's no need to describe something that already exists in a lengthy manner. It's called <span class="italic">not reinventing the wheel</span>. If someone already did what you're trying to do, and you can reuse what's already been done…just do it!</p><p class="calibre_2">As we already said, you don't have to be innovative in every aspect. On the contrary, using familiar mechanics where needed is as important as creating new breakthrough features. In the case of new mechanics, the GDD can contain a link to a playable prototype or footage of prototyped gameplay. Remember that as a designer you should always clearly describe what you’re showing in any media you are presenting. Showing a video of a particular game's combat system and just stating "Our game combat system works in the same way as the one shown in the video" is clearly a very bad way of writing documentation.</p><p class="calibre_2">On the other hand, if you're working on a turn-based RPG that uses an <span class="italic">initiative bar</span> to show the player in which order the characters attack, you can definitely use a video or an image from an existing game:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00003.jpg" class="calibre_22"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">In </span><span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">Grand Kingdom</span></span><span class="calibre4">, as in many turn-based JRPGs, an initiative bar shows the combat order.

<div id="filepos316195" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">It leaves space for creativity and debate</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A game development team is usually composed of some very talented professionals. Creating documentation that doesn't leave any space for these people to express themselves through their work most certainly means that the team's potential will remain unexpressed.</p><p class="calibre_2">This means that if you're writing about game characters, for example, you should limit your work to what is needed from a designer. Details such as how the character is dressed, how she moves, which sounds/soundtrack accompany her, might not need a formal specification and can be left to the artist's interpretation (unless those details serve some purpose in terms of gameplay and need to be <span class="italic">directed</span> by the game design). Likewise, even if you are a highly technical game designer, and though you may be able to write code yourself, you don’t want to tell a game programmer how to implement the code for a specific feature.</p><p class="calibre_2">The idea is to communicate the <span class="italic">intention</span> rather than the <span class="italic">implementation</span>. Don't tell other people on your team how to do their job! Everyone in the team should be able and free to tackle the development challenges in the way he or she thinks is the best. It is highly probable that the same GDD handed to two different professionals will end up with the same result achieved in very different ways.</p><p class="calibre_2">It's a matter of mutual trust; everyone trusts that your documentation is the design of a compelling feature for the player, so you have to trust that the team is going to do its best to realize it. For the same reason, don't expect to write a GDD and then just hand it over to the team and move on to your next thing.</p><p class="calibre_2">Someone could raise questions or issues with something you've written, and these concerns have to be addressed and will eventually require an iteration on the document, fixing what doesn’t work or accounting for new, cleverer solutions.</p><p class="calibre_2">Even more probable, these problems might not arise until the actual development stage, meaning that they need prompt problem solving <span class="italic">on the go</span>. This is very much part of how game design works.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Sometimes, it might happen that the actual implementation diverged from what was written in the GDD. Never think of the GDD as some sort of dogmatic instruction manual on how to develop the game. If the actual implementation accomplishes the game vision or even does something better than the original design, it's the GDD that needs to be changed, not what’s been implemented!</span></span></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_211"/>

The spatial constraint of the slide format is a great way to keep the text brief and to the point. Modularity, again, is intrinsic to the tool. You can swap slide positions, copy them in other documents, color-code your slides by arguments, and mark a slide as one with <span class="italic">dependencies</span>, meaning it would need to be reviewed and updated if the document that references it gets changed.</p><p class="calibre_2">A presentation can also be used to make UI prototypes; using hyperlinks and integrated drawing tools, it is possible to easily create a menu or a screens flow.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Pros:</span></p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Versatility</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Being already in a presentation format, the GDD is easy to present or talk through</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">The slide format helps in keeping it short and essential</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Easy to print</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Modular format</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Good for UI prototyping and screens flows</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">Can be personalized with interesting formats</li></ul><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Cons:</span></p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Collaborative work might be difficult</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Not efficient for showing tables or big diagrams (spatial constraint)</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Cloud-based presentations can get slow if the file size is too big (too many slides and images)</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Can be personalized with interesting formats (yes, this is also a con; if you overdo this, or don't know how to make good-looking presentations, you can end up with really ugly things!)</li></ul><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Apple Keynote</span>, <span class="italic">Microsoft PowerPoint</span>, and <span class="italic">Google Presentations</span> are all great tools for writing presentations.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_221"/>

A mind map might not end up in the final GDD, but nonetheless is a great way to organize ideas and draft an outline of what will be written in more detail later. Game design is about solving problems and mind maps have proven a very effective tool across many disciplines. Every game designer should try to use them whenever he feels that simple writing or brainstorming is not helping to visualize on paper his ideas and thoughts.</p><p class="calibre_2">Sometimes, including a mind map in the final GDD proves to be a great way to communicate the rationale behind decisions. This is particularly useful when working on collaborative documents or to inspire creativity in the reader:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00057.jpg" class="calibre_23"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">A mind map can be used to describe a high-level idea for a generic fantasy RPG game</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Writing a mind map is simple:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Start with a central idea or a concept and write it down (possibly in the center of your page); that is your <span class="italic">seed</span>.</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Write an idea or concept connected to your seed and draw a bold line that goes out from the seed and toward this new idea.

<div id="filepos331881" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Spreadsheets</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">A spreadsheet is probably the most important tool in game design. While words and images can be used to describe a game, a spreadsheet can represent an entire game in numbers and simulate its rules before a single line of code is written. Some games, at a certain level of abstraction, are basically spreadsheets.</p><p class="calibre_2">Imagine a game such as <span class="italic">Age of Empires</span> or another <span class="bold">real-time strategy</span> (<span class="bold">RTS</span>) game. Each unit, building, and resources is nothing but a set of numbers and those numbers determine everything that happens in the game. With some skill and a lot of patience, it is possible to program and play a simple RTS or RPG only using Excel. There is more: video games can contain an incredible amount of data and very complex economies. A spreadsheet is the only way to organize, visualize, and manage that data.</p><p class="calibre_2">We’ll talk about spreadsheets in depth later, when we talk about balancing; for now just keep in mind that this is an essential tool that should be used any time a set of values or objects has to be described. Balancing, though, is a separate phase from documentation and it’s usually done quite early in project development. Spreadsheets, nonetheless, have to be used from the very start.</p><p class="calibre_2">To give you a practical example, let's think about an RPG game such as <span class="italic">Witcher 3</span>. There are hundreds of items available in the game, each belonging to a particular category and with specific characteristics. These items need to be part of the initial design, and a spreadsheet is the best tool to list and organize them. The initial list can include only a few columns, for example, the category and a name, but later in development the same spreadsheet can be improved by adding numeric values: the damage for the weapons or the items needed for crafting.</p><p class="calibre_2">It is not only the functionalities made available from a spreadsheet that make it a great tool for a game designer. A spreadsheet can also be easily imported directly into game engines, allowing the game designer to interact with the game variables directly from it.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Pros:</span></p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Powerful tool to simulate and describe games</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Prototype and balance simulations</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Searchable and organizable</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Perfect for lists of objects</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Can be imported right into the game</li></ul><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Cons:</span></p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Increase in complexity decreases readability</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Complex systems are difficult to maintain</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Doesn’t support images very well</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Cloud-based spreadsheets can get slow</li></ul><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Microsoft Excel</span> and <span class="italic">Google Sheets</span> are the standard spreadsheets every game designer should know.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_225"/>


<div id="filepos335387" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Project management (PM) tools</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">These tools are designed to plan, organize, and manage projects of different natures, game design included. For bigger games, GDDs should be separate from production documents and tools to keep track of progress and schedules, which will most likely be created and maintained by different people (producers or project managers).</p><p class="calibre_2">As a result, using PM tools could result in the game designer using only a minimal part of the entire software functionality—a complete overkill. For smaller projects or agile teams, though, game design features can be described as tickets, issues, or tasks in a PM tool, which will serve at the same time as a GDD and as a tracking tool.</p><p class="calibre_2">Trello is a great example of PM software that can be used as a GDD for a small game.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Pros:</span></p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Tracking development progress of each design</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Integrated environment for bugs and issue tracking</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Allows you to assign designs to specific persons in the team</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Time tracking</li></ul><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Cons:</span></p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Not as easy to use as a text file or presentation</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Underuse of the entire software package</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Weak multimedia integration</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Difficult to export in different formats or to print</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">The most interesting PM tool for GDD is <span class="italic">Trello</span>, but other software includes <span class="italic">Jira</span>, <span class="italic">Hansoft</span>, and <span class="italic">Evernote.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_227"/>

The growing and ever-changing amount of information needed in design documents found a perfect fit in online documentation that is designed to write, store, and organize complex information from many people over the internet.</p><p class="calibre_2">Wikis have also become the go-to tools for player communities to store information about their favorite games. These fan-based game encyclopedias are useful tools for developers too, as it can be very difficult for a developer to discern between the development team and the player’s knowledge of a game.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Pros:</span></p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Accessibility via browser</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Built-in categorization and indexing</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Easy to search</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Easy to track changes</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Hyperlinks to web resources allow browser navigation</li><li value="6" class="calibre_9">Embedded multimedia files</li><li value="7" class="calibre_9">Can link to wiki pages directly from internal bug reports and other correspondence, making verification of a bug very easy</li><li value="8" class="calibre_9">Version history and revision control typically built in</li><li value="9" class="calibre_9">Highly customizable</li></ul><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Cons:</span></p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Pages can get orphaned and unreachable</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Not as easy to use as a text file or presentation</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">A wiki is not sequential, so it could be difficult to read from start to finish</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Hard to comment or annotate</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Hard to print</li></ul><p class="calibre_2">Some great software for creating Wikis are <span class="italic">Confluence</span>, <span class="italic">TWiki</span>, and <span class="italic">Wikia.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_229"/>


<div id="filepos339908" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Illustration tools</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Most designers use illustration tools to draw diagrams, but some designers work on <span class="bold">User Interface</span> (<span class="bold">UI</span>) and <span class="bold">User Experience</span> (<span class="bold">UX</span>) design as well (especially for mobile and browser games). Sometimes, even more complex illustration tools can be used to draw infographics or to give a particular format to a GDD.</p><p class="calibre_2">Illustration tools are also used to explain some mechanics that require a visual explanation. Designing actions that a character can perform in an action game is a good example; it’s always a good idea to pair a textual description with an image.</p><p class="calibre_2">Creating wireframes and click dummies is another important part of writing GDDs. A wireframe is essentially a sketch of the UI layout, made only using boxes and basic lines/shapes, without worrying about the final look. A click dummy is a prototype of the interactions the player can have on a specific screen or section of the game.</p><p class="calibre_2">Wasting time writing how buttons work and where they lead might be a bad idea when it is possible to simply show it with a working prototype:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00034.jpg" class="calibre_24"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Using wireframes to design the UI and complement the game design is a great way to convey both the mechanics and how the player is supposed to interact with them</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Another important use of illustration tools is drawing maps and designing levels. Many times in your career (all the time, if you'll be working as a level designer) you will have to sketch out maps and levels before jumping on the actual level building (using a game engine or a level editor tool). Personally, I find this one of the most interesting parts of game design. I've been doing map design since I was a kid, playing games such as <span class="italic">Dungeon &amp; Dragons</span> and <span class="italic">Hero Quest</span>.</p><p class="calibre_2">Creating dungeons to explore and puzzles to solve for my friends was my first approach to game design and game documentation, and I was only 12! If you haven’t played those games (pen and paper RPGs, or dungeon crawler board games) I highly recommend doing so. They will provide you some great insights into game design and player behaviors. Also, they are insanely fun, and it’s never too late to start:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00060.jpg" class="calibre_25"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the ultimate source for maps and interesting dungeon/level design. This one is from the Starter Set of the 5th Edition</span></p><p class="calibre_2">If this sounds interesting, there is a lot more about level design and maps later in this book!</p><p class="calibre_2">Some commonly used software for drawing diagrams are <span class="italic">Microsoft Visio</span> and <span class="italic">Dia.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Popular tools for creating (UI) wireframes and click dummies are <span class="italic">Adobe Experience Design</span>, <span class="italic">PowerPoint</span>, and <span class="italic">Balsamiq.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">All-round illustration tools that allow creating actual drawings are <span class="italic">Adobe Photoshop,</span>

<div id="filepos343602" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Writing techniques</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">These are techniques borrowed from creative writing, presentation design, technical documentation writing, and best practices that game designers have used and refined over thousands of game projects.</p><p class="calibre_2">Here follows a list of useful techniques to write effective GDDs.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_233"/>


<div id="filepos344116" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Use of style</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The style in which you write matters; as with any other document, you need to make sure your GDD is readable and attractive to look at:</p><div class="calibre_7"> </div><ul class="calibre_8"><li value="1" class="calibre_9"><ul class="calibre_115"><li value="1" class="calibre_9">Use plenty of white space and divide argument paragraphs</li><li value="2" class="calibre_9">Use a serif font for body text, bold or capital letters for headers</li><li value="3" class="calibre_9">Avoid any fancy or decorative fonts</li><li value="4" class="calibre_9">Use short sentences</li><li value="5" class="calibre_9">Use a hierarchical structure</li></ul></li></ul><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_235"/>


<div id="filepos344997" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Layering details</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">When you write about something, you should always use a top-down approach to layering complexity. The first layer should already give a good general idea of what you’re talking about, and successive layers should go deeper into details.</p><p class="calibre_2">Think about how journalists write articles for newspapers. When reading an article, you can generally always get the gist of the story by reading the headline, then the first sentence will back it up and give some explanation. The rest of the article will provide all the details needed.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_237"/>


<div id="filepos345769" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Prioritize</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">If you are describing a complex system that will be developed in different phases, or one that will need some iterations, always describe the system design in phases: the essential part of the features can be described first and marked in a specific color (for a prototype or MVP in initial development) with other parts of the feature described later and marked as successive iterations or <span class="italic">nice to have.</span></p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_239"/>


<div id="filepos346376" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Use of keywords</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Using keywords makes your document more readable and catches the reader's attention. Use <span class="bold">bold</span> or <span class="italic">italics</span> to emphasize keyword and important statements. A GDD is going to be read multiple times, and while the first one will hopefully be a thorough read, any successive consultation will need to focus on fewer details. The problem of using too many keywords, obviously, is that keywords will lose their importance, so think before you mark anything as more important. Remember, your document should already be lean and essential.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_241"/>


<div id="filepos347119" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Table of Contents</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Use a Table of Contents (always!) GDD as reference tools! Even for a shorter document, a Table of Contents with hyperlinks to the different sections is vital to access the required information quickly.</p><p class="calibre_2">If a document goes through a lot of revisions, you might also want to consider integrating a version history.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_243"/>


<div id="filepos347677" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Bullet points</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Bullet points are effective and brief. They can act as a to-do list for the reader and cut off much useless and verbose writing. If you write them in a hierarchy, they also communicate priorities. Be sure not to create a wall of bullets points. If you end up with a list of more than ten elements, you're probably not focusing on the essentials, or not deconstructing your feature into small enough pieces that can be handled in separate sections or documents.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_245"/>


<div id="filepos348336" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Images with captions</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">The use of images is almost mandatory for writing a clear GDD, but what really works is associating the images with meaningful captions. Maybe the concept you are showing is described in detail in a paragraph, but always reinforce what you are showing with an image. Even better, whenever possible try to describe the image with the caption only, or associate with an image a short bullet point list, with no other text whatsoever.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_247"/>


<div id="filepos348973" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Diagrams</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Many concepts of game design simply cannot be described with words. Use flowcharts to show screen flows or UX; use state machines to describe scenarios or player behaviors; use charts to represent data. Don't use too-complex diagrams that no one is going to understand, but most of all don't use diagrams to tell programmers how to do their jobs (even better, never tell anyone how to do their job!).</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_249"/>


<div id="filepos349567" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Variables</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Avoid specifying numbers, numeric ranges, or any fixed values that are likely to change many times during development. Use <span class="italic">variables</span> instead, names that will represent those values, whatever they are going to be. This is also an effective way of writing pieces of documentation where some details are not yet defined, and automatically answers typical questions such as "How many of these are we going to have?" or "How long is this going to last?" Putting a variable in your design lets everyone know that a certain value must be kept flexible and open to change.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_251"/>


<div id="filepos350333" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Redundancy</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Cut unnecessary words and redundancy. Cut anything that feels like <span class="italic">discursive writing</span> or has been mentioned or explained already.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_253"/>


<div id="filepos350665" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Hyperlinks</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Use hyperlinks. You are not writing a printed book. Take advantage of hypertext but make sure its style is recognizable.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_255"/>


<div id="filepos350981" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Write incrementally by drafting</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Draft to understand the problem and write to solve it. Start writing your GDD as soon as possible and with no particular attention to detail. Make bullet points and outlines to identify the problem and use mind maps. Sometimes, even something that is clear in your mind can show its pitfalls and obscure points only when it is written in black on white. Solutions will come easily if the problem solving is part of the writing, especially when you are stuck trying to solve one problem only in your mind.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_257"/>


<div id="filepos351702" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Elegance in game design</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">One of the most important principles of good game design is elegance. We are going to talk about elegance in game design throughout the whole book, and it is a concept that hopefully you're going to assimilate in every chapter. In your game designer career, you are going to hear it all the time: <span class="italic">we need an elegant solution for this</span>, <span class="italic">look at how elegant this tutorial is,</span>
<span class="italic">such elegance in this feature design.</span> What are they talking about?</p><p class="calibre_2">If you look at the meaning of the word elegance, two keywords are widely used to explain what it is: efficiency and simplicity.</p><p class="calibre_2">Games are extremely complex systems, so elegance in design is not a luxury, as the word might suggest, but a strict requirement. Elegant design means features and game mechanics that are simple to learn and hard to master. It means that despite the intrinsic complexity of the system, pretty much everyone should be able to interact with it. Elegance allows accessibility.</p><p class="calibre_2">The classic example of elegance in game design is chess, a simple yet incredibly deep game that has been played for centuries and is still compelling and exciting nowadays. There are more modern examples of elegant game design though. Supercell's Clash Royale is certainly one of those. A CCG with not many cards and a simple real-time PVP arena is one of the most-played competitive games in video game history. It is incredibly simple, yet it offers so much depth and such a clever metagame design.</p><p class="calibre_2">It is important to notice that elegance doesn't mean quality. Some AAA games are famous for completely failing at being elegant. These games tend to be extremely complex to accommodate a demanding hardcore audience, but the greater the complexity, the lower the chances of achieving elegant solutions.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_259"/>


<div id="filepos353851" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Keep it short and simple (KISS)</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">This principle is also known as "Keep it simple, stupid!"</p><p class="calibre_2">A very popular design principle, it was introduced in 1960 by the US Navy. The principle simply states that a system works best if it's simple by design. As trivial as it may sound, Kelly Johnson, the lead engineer who coined it, made a very valid example to remind us how important it can be. It goes more or less like this:</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">Consider a jet aircraft that should be repaired by an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only a handful of basic tools.</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Video games are complex systems, full of moving parts and made with advanced technologies. Compared to Johnson's maxim, we are talking about futuristic spaceships that only scientists in their labs might be able to repair.</p><p class="calibre_2">To use the KISS principle as a game designer means making sure that this complexity is managed and not overused. To remove the superfluous, have a simpler system for the benefit of both the development team and the players.</p><p class="calibre_2">As we already mentioned, iterating is a fundamental part of the development of a successful game. In order to effectively iterate and improve, at any stage of development, your game needs to be exactly like Johnson's aircraft.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_261"/>


<div id="filepos355496" style="height:0pt"/><p class="calibre_1"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The less-is-more principle</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2">Another fundamental principle of game design is called <span class="italic">less-is-more</span>. It is a call for minimalistic design, in line with everything we have said so far.</p><p class="calibre_2">But how do you apply this principle in practice?</p><p class="calibre_2">The answer is pretty straightforward: while designing or prototyping a game, instead of adding features or mechanics on top of what you have, try to take something out.</p><p class="calibre_2">This is especially true when something doesn't quite work as expected. Usually, everyone is tempted to add something to the system to make it finally work. Most of the time this is a bad idea, as adding functionalities to something problematic at its core will never solve that original issue, and just hide it at best. In this case, it is a much better idea to take the time to dig into what's already there and find out what it is that causes the problem in the first place, then just try to remove it!</p><p class="calibre_2">If you think about games such as <span class="italic">Super Hexagon</span> and <span class="italic">Thomas Was Alone</span>, you immediately get how minimalistic design can make, for example, your game art much simpler without affecting the gameplay or reducing its enjoyability:</p><p class="calibre_11"><img src="images/00149.jpg" class="calibre_26"/></p><p class="calibre_70"><span class="calibre4">Super Hexagon is a classic example of minimalistic design. The player controls a small triangle, and the game world consists of a central hexagon that attracts geometrical shapes</span></p><p class="calibre_2">Minimalistic design is not only about art. <span class="italic">Shadow of the Colossus</span> is a great example of an incredible-looking game with minimalistic design. The less-is-more principle here is applied to enemy encounters. The game doesn't feature any minor enemy battles; there are only 16 enemies in the whole game, and they all are bosses. This unique approach to enemies in video games made this game stand out from anything else available at the time (and even now!)</p><p class="calibre_2">We will talk more about this principle and see how it works in the following chapters about the creation of game mechanics.</p><blockquote class="calibre_113"><blockquote class="calibre6"><blockquote class="calibre_114"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">The screenshots used in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only.
