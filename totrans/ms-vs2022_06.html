     Advanced Web Development Tools
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     In this chapter, we will embark upon an advanced exploration of web development tools within the robust environment of Visual Studio 2022.
    
    
     Our exploration will begin with an examination of a web form designer powered by Web Live Preview, which offers us a way to visualize and iterate on our designs while working on legacy ASP.NET web form applications.
    
    
     Next, we will turn our attention to the dynamic capabilities of Visual Studio’s API Exploration and Dev Tunnel functionalities, enhancing our API development experience.
    
    
     Further enriching our toolkit, we will investigate the Node.js workload of
    
    
     
      Visual Studio.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In this chapter, we’ll cover the
    
    
     
      following topics:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     
      Real-time web previews powered by Web
     
     
      
       Live Preview
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      API Exploration and Dev Tunnel with
     
     
      
       Visual Studio
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Node.js integration with
     
     
      
       Visual Studio
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     By the end of this chapter, armed with these advanced web development tools and techniques, we will be equipped to elevate our productivity for our web projects to
    
    
     
      new heights.

     Real-time web previews powered by Web Live Preview
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     Microsoft announced that ASP.NET, when used
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker409">
    </a>
    
     with old frameworks, including web form
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker410">
    </a>
    
     applications, will continue to support old .NET Framework versions.
    
    
     Following that, Visual Studio 2022 has introduced a designer for Web Forms projects that are powered by Web Live Preview.
    
    
     In this section, we will explore how to utilize the new Web Forms designer along with additional features offered by Web Live Preview.
    
    
     This feature is specifically tailored for teams handling
    
    
     
      legacy projects.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     As this feature is currently dedicated only to Web Forms in .NET Framework, if you are using MVC and .NET Core, there is no forms designer available.
    
    
     To stay up to date with the latest web standards and browser support, Web Live Preview in Visual Studio uses WebView2, which is powered by
    
    
     
      Microsoft Edge.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     To illustrate our examples, we will create a project using
    
    <em class="italic">
     
      ASP.NET (.
     
    </em>
    
     <em class="italic">
      
       NET Framework)
      
     </em>
    
    
     
      .
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     If we open the
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      default.aspx
     
    </strong>
    
     file or any other
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      .aspx
     
    </strong>
    
     file, we’ll notice two buttons at the
    
    
     
      bottom left:
     
    
   </p>
   <div><div><img alt="Figure 6.1 – The Design and Split buttons" src="img/B22218_06_1.jpg"/>

   <p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">
    
     Figure 6.1 – The Design and Split buttons
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     These buttons allow us
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker411">
    </a>
    
     to display the designer, powered
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker412">
    </a>
    
     by Web Live Preview, in two different ways: full-size or split next to the code.
    
    
     We will click on the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Split
     
    </strong>
    
     button to observe the impact the designer has on our
    
    
     
      code base:
     
    
   </p>
   <div><div><img alt="Figure 6.2 – The Split view" src="img/B22218_06_2.jpg"/>

     Figure 6.2 – The Split view
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     By clicking on the component, we can edit
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker413">
    </a>
    
     the label.
    
    
     Additionally, like in the designer
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker414">
    </a>
    
     for WinForm, we can drag and drop items in the toolbox to place them in
    
    
     
      the designer.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     The following options are offered by
    
    
     
      this toolbox:

     our experience working with the legacy web framework.

     Using API Explorer and Dev Tunnel with Visual Studio
    
   </h1>
   <p>
    
     When we talk about web
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker419">
    </a>
    
     development, APIs come to mind for handling communication
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker420">
    </a>
    
     regarding each component.
    
    
     In this section, we will explore new Visual Studio features to enhance our experience during API development.
    
    
     First, we will learn how to use HTTP files to explore our endpoint, after which we will configure Dev Tunnel so that we can share our in-development APIs with clients, managers,
    
    
     
      and colleagues.

     Generating .http files with Endpoints Explorer
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     Using
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      .http
     
    </strong>
    
     files to test
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker421">
    </a>
    
     and document API endpoints
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker422">
    </a>
    
     is incredibly convenient and efficient.
    
    
     This approach allows us to streamline API testing
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker423">
    </a>
    
     and development directly within our
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      integrated development environment
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      IDE
     
    </strong>
    
     ) – for example, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code,
    
    
     
      or IntelliJ.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     With
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      .http
     
    </strong>
    
     files, we can write HTTP requests directly within our IDE and execute them without switching to a separate tool or browser.
    
    
     This integration keeps our development workflow within the IDE, enabling quick iterations and debugging, which ultimately
    
    
     
      boosts productivity.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     These
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      .http
     
    </strong>
    
     files adhere to the standards of RFC 9110 HTTP Semantics (the last version of the document, which establishes a solid foundation for understanding
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker424">
    </a>
    
     and implementing the protocol:
    
    <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html">
     
      https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html
     
    </a>
    
     ), ensuring that our requests are correctly formatted and understood by the HTTP clients that are integrated into our IDEs.
    
    
     This standardization also makes the files portable and easily shareable among team members, and they can be seamlessly integrated into our CI/CD pipelines for
    
    
     
      efficient development.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Furthermore, integrating
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      .http
     
    </strong>
    
     files into our existing development processes, including version control and code reviews, simplifies the management of API testing code, making it more maintainable and readable.
    
    
     The support for various HTTP methods, headers, and authentication mechanisms provides us with flexibility and power in terms of
    
    
     
      API testing.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Regarding Visual Studio, the support for
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      .http
     
    </strong>
    
     files has significantly simplified the API testing process.
    
    
     We can create and execute HTTP requests directly within Visual Studio, eliminating the need to recreate requests for testing purposes, which makes the whole process more efficient
    
    
     
      and user-friendly.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     First, we can list all the endpoints of our application with the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Endpoint Explorer

    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      .http

     file or a parent folder.
    
    
     We must set the different environments in the JSON file
    
    
     
      like so:
     
    
   </p>
   <pre class="source-code">

  "dev": {
    "HostAddress": "https://localhost:5128"
  },
  "remote": {
    "HostAddress": "https://contoso.com"
  }
}</pre>
   <p>
    
     Now, we can select the environment where we want to send the request from the top-right corner of
    
    
     
      the file:
     
    
   </p>
   <div><div><img alt="Figure 6.8 – Selecting an environment" src="img/B22218_06_8.jpg"/>

     Now, we can build a file

     that we can share with teams

   <p>
    
     In Visual Studio 2022, Dev Tunnel
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker433">
    </a>
    
     allows developers to create temporary connections between machines that can’t connect directly.
    
    
     This feature is great for debugging and testing web APIs and ASP.NET Core applications, especially when these applications need to be accessed from various devices, such as mobile emulators or physical devices.
    
    
     It’s a valuable tool for us when we’re working on applications that require testing across different machines
    
    
     
      or devices.

   <p>
    
     Here are some use cases
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker434">

     where Dev Tunnel could
    
    
     
      be useful:

   <ul>
    <li>

    <li>
     
      Communication with external services (for example,
     
     
      
       Twilio webhooks)

     Exploring JavaScript project templates
    
   </h2>
   <p>
    
     In Visual Studio 2022, a new
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker439">
    </a>
    
     project type called
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      JavaScript Project System
     
    </strong>
    
     (
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      JSPS
     
    </strong>
    
     ) has been introduced that utilizes
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker440">
    </a>
    
     the
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      .esproj
     
    </strong>
    
     file format.
    
    
     This system allows us to create independent Angular, React, and Vue projects directly within Visual Studio.
    
    
     These frontend projects leverage the CLI tools of the respective frameworks that are installed on our machine, allowing us to choose the template version
    
    
     
      we prefer.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     First, we need to verify whether the Node.js workload has been installed properly in our Visual Studio instance.
    
    
     To do this, open the Visual Studio Installer and check the installed workloads (see
    
    
     <em class="italic">
      
       Figure 6
      
     </em>

     Figure 6.11 – Node.js development workload
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Having ensured that we have the necessary workload
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker441">
    </a>
    
     installed, we can explore the template offered by Visual Studio 2022 for JavaScript development.
    
    
     For that, we will create a new project and select
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      JavaScript
     
    </strong>
    
     in the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      Language combo
     
    </strong>
    
     box.
    
    
     Once you’ve done that, you will be presented with the
    
    
     
      following screen:
     
    
   </p>
   <div><div><img alt="Figure 6.12 – JavaScript template" src="img/B22218_06_12.jpg"/>

   <p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">
    
     Figure 6.12 – JavaScript template
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Here, we can see that Visual Studio
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker442">
    </a>
    
     offers several JavaScript base templates that we can split into
    
    
     
      three categories:
     
    
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     
      ASP.NET Core combines with the modern
     
     
      
       JavaScript framework
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Standalone JavaScript
     
     
      
       project (client-side)
      
     
    </li>
    <li>
     
      Backend
     
     
      
       Node.js project
      
     
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    
     For our example, we will pick the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      ReactApp
     
    </strong>
    
     template as standalone
    
    
     
      JavaScript project
     
    
    
     
      .
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     When creating the project, we’ll see that Visual Studio launches a console prompting for the
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      npm cli
     
    </strong>
    
     command so that it can create
    
    
     
      the application:
     
    
   </p>
   <div><div><img alt="Figure 6.13 – npm CLI" src="img/B22218_06_13.jpg"/>

   <p>
    
     Once we’ve set up the project, we can develop our application while adhering to React or other modern JavaScript frameworks.
    
    
     One of the initial steps involves installing the necessary npm packages.
    
    
     While we can certainly do this directly using the npm CLI, let’s explore how Visual Studio
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker443">

     Managing npm packages
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker444">

      package manager.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Beginning with Visual Studio 2022, we have access to the npm package manager for CLI-based projects.
    
    
     This means that we can now download npm modules like how we can download NuGet packages for ASP.NET Core projects.
    
    
     We can then utilize the

     As you can see, debugging server-side JavaScript applications is straightforward.
    
    
     Now, let’s explore debugging
    
    
     
      client-side scripts.
     
    
   </p>
   <h3>
    
     Debugging client-side scripts
    
   </h3>
   <p>
    
     In Visual Studio, we have debugging
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker448">
    </a>
    
     support specifically for Chrome and Microsoft Edge (Chromium) when it comes to client-side debugging.
    
    
     Sometimes, our debugger will automatically stop at breakpoints in JavaScript, TypeScript, and embedded scripts within
    
    
     
      HTML files.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     To debug JavaScript within ASP.NET using Chrome, Edge (Chromium), and Internet Explorer, we need to navigate to the debugging option by selecting
    
    <strong class="bold">

     Figure 6.16 – Debugging options
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Enabling this option ensures that Visual Studio
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker449">
    </a>
    
     supports debugging client-side code effectively within
    
    
     
      ASP.NET projects.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     In our previous example, we created a standalone React application that required our source code to be transpiled by tools such as TypeScript or Babel.
    
    
     Utilizing source maps during debugging ensures an optimal experience by bridging the gap between minified or transpiled code and its original, human-readable form.
    
    
     This facilitates debugging by allowing developers to set breakpoints and inspect variables in their original state within the browser’s developer tools or Visual Studio’s
    
    
     
      debugging environment.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Visual Studio automatically generates source maps for TypeScript projects.
    
    
     However, for JavaScript projects, we need to configure build tools such as webpack to produce source maps.
    
    
     For TypeScript projects, include a
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      tsconfig.json
     
    </strong>
    
     file with the
    
    <strong class="bold">
     
      sourceMap
     
    </strong>
    
     compiler option set to true.
    
    
     For JavaScript projects using webpack, configure it with
    
    
     <strong class="source-inline">
      
       devtool: "source-map"
      
     </strong>
    
    
     
      .
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Next, ensure that Visual Studio is properly configured to use source maps.
    
    
     This may involve adjusting paths within generated source map files to accurately reference source files.
    
    
     For webpack users, remove the
    
    <strong class="source-inline">
     
      webpack:///
     
    </strong>
    
     prefix from source
    
    
     
      map paths.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     Once source maps have been set up, debugging a React project in Visual Studio becomes straightforward.
    
    
     Simply attach the debugger to the running application – this allows you to set breakpoints and step through the code as if it were running in its original, un-minified form.
    
    
     This streamlined approach helps with quickly identifying and
    
    
     
      fixing issues.
     
    
   </p>
   <p>
    
     For more complex debugging
    
    <a id="_idIndexMarker450">
    </a>
    
     scenarios, additional adjustments to the project configuration or the use of supplementary tools may be necessary.
    
    
     Ensure that webpack is configured properly to generate source maps.
    
    
     Additionally, enable JavaScript source maps in your browser’s Developer Tools settings to fully utilize source maps
    
    
     
      during debugging.
