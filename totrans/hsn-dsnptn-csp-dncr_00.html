<p>The purpose of this book is to <span>give readers </span>a broad understanding of patterns in modern software development while diving into more detail with specific examples. The number of patterns used when developing solutions is vast, and often, developers use patterns without knowing they are doing so. This book covers patterns from low-level code, to high-level concepts used in solutions that run in the cloud.</p>
<p>Though many of the patterns presented do not require a specific language, C# and .NET Core will be used to illustrate examples for many of them. C# and .NET Core were chosen due to their popularity and design, which supports building solutions from simple console applications to large-enterprise distributed systems.</p>
<p>Covering a large number of patterns, the book serves as a great introduction to many of them, while allowing a deeper, hands-on approach to a selected collection. The specific patterns covered have been selected as they illustrate a specific point or aspect of patterns. References to additional resources are provided to allow the reader to dive deeper into patterns of particular interest.</p>
<p><span>From simple websites to large-enterprise distributed systems, the right pattern can make the difference between a successful, long-lived solution and a solution viewed as a failure due to its poor performance and high cost. This book covers many patterns that can be applied to build solutions that handle the inevitable change required to stay competitive in business, as well as achieve the robustness and reliability expected of modern applications.</span></p>

<p>The target audience is modern application developers working in a collaborative environment. Intentionally, this represents a great number of backgrounds and industries as the patterns can be applied to a wide range of solutions. As this book dives into the code to explain the patterns covered, readers should have a background in software developmentâ€”this book should not be viewed as a <em>how to program</em> book but more of a <em>how to program <strong>better</strong></em> book. Because of this, the target audience will range from junior developers to senior developers, to software architects and designers. For some readers, the content will be new; for others, it will be a refresher.</p>

<p><span>This book does assume some familiarity with OOP and C#. Though this book covers advanced topics, it is not designed to be a comprehensive development guide. Instead, the goal of the book is to advance the skill levels of developers and designers by providing a wide array of patterns, practices, and principles. Using a </span>toolbox<em> </em><span>analogy, the book provides a large number of tools for the modern application developer by progressing from low-level code design to higher-level architecture, as well as important patterns and principles commonly used today.</span></p>
<p>This book brought the following main points that are additions to readers knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>To know more about SOLID Principles, best practices with the help of coding examples using C#7.x and .NET Core 2.2.</li>
<li>In-depth understanding of classic design pattern (Gang of four patterns).</li>
<li>Functional programming principle and its working examples using C# language.</li>
<li>Real world examples of Architectural patterns (MVC, MVVM).</li>
<li>Understanding of native cloud, microservices and more.</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "The three <kbd>CounterA()</kbd>, <kbd>CounterB()</kbd>, and <kbd>CounterC()</kbd> methods represent an individual ticket collection counter."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>3-counters are serving...<br/>Next person from row<br/>Person A is collecting ticket from Counter A<br/>Person B is collecting ticket from Counter B<br/>Person C is collecting ticket from Counter C</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>public bool UpdateQuantity(string name, int quantity)<br/>{<br/>    <strong>lock (_lock)</strong><br/>    {<br/>        _books[name].Quantity += quantity;<br/>    }<br/><br/>    return true;<br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>dotnet new sln</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "From <span class="packt_screen">Create New Product</span>, you can add a new product, and <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> will give you the facility to update an existing product.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
