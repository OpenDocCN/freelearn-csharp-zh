<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-124">Design Patterns and .NET 8 Implementation</h1>
<p class="normal">Design patterns can be defined as ready-to-use architectural solutions for common problems you encounter during software development. They are essential for understanding the .NET architecture and useful for solving ordinary problems that we face when designing any piece of software. In this chapter, we will look at the implementation of some design patterns. It is worth mentioning that this book does not explain all the known patterns we can use. The focus here is to explain the importance of studying and applying them.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Understanding design patterns and their purpose</li>
<li class="bulletList">Understanding the design patterns available in .NET</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will have learned about some of the use cases that you can implement with design patterns.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-125">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To complete this chapter, you will need the free Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition or better.</p>
<p class="normal">You can find the sample code for this chapter at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Software-Architecture-with-C-Sharp-12-and-.NET-8-4E">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Software-Architecture-with-C-Sharp-12-and-.NET-8-4E</a>/tree/main/ch06.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-126">Understanding design patterns and their purpose</h1>
<p class="normal">Deciding on the <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>design of a system is challenging, and the responsibility associated with this task is enormous. As software architects, we must always keep in mind that features such as great reusability, good performance, and good maintainability are important for delivering a good solution. This is where design patterns help and accelerate the design process.</p>
<p class="normal">As we mentioned previously, design patterns are solutions that have already been discussed and defined so that they can solve common software architectural problems. This approach grew in popularity after the release of the book <em class="italic">Design Patterns – Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em>, where <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>the <strong class="keyWord">Gang of Four</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">GoF</strong>) divided these patterns into three types: creational, structural, and behavioral.</p>
<p class="normal">A little bit later, Uncle Bob introduced the SOLID principles to the developer community, giving us the opportunity to efficaciously organize the functions and data structures of each system. The SOLID design principles indicate how the components of software should be designed and connected. It is worth mentioning that, compared to the design patterns presented by GoF, the SOLID principles do not deliver code recipes. Instead, they give you the basic principles to follow when you design your solutions, keeping the software’s structure strong and reliable. They can be defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Single Responsibility</strong>: A <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>module or function should be responsible for a single purpose.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Open-Closed</strong>: A<a id="_idIndexMarker358"/> software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modification.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Liskov Substitution</strong>: The<a id="_idIndexMarker359"/> behavior of a program needs to remain unchanged when you substitute one of its components for another component that has been defined by a supertype of the primer object.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Interface Segregation</strong>: Depending<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> on the way you create interfaces, you will promote dependencies that do not necessarily occur when you build their concrete objects, causing harm to the system architecture.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Dependency Inversion</strong>: The<a id="_idIndexMarker361"/> most flexible systems are the ones where object dependencies only refer to abstractions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">As technologies and software problems change, more patterns are conceived. The advance of cloud computing has brought a bunch of them, and some can be found at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns</a>. The content is organized into three different challenge areas: Data Management, Design and Implementation, and Messaging. Many of them are described in the chapters of this book, as we can see in the list below:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Asynchronous Request-Reply</strong>: This pattern is presented while discussing Azure Durable Functions in <em class="italic">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italic">Working with Serverless - Azure Functions</em>; the orchestrator function for <strong class="keyWord">async HTTP APIs</strong> solves this pattern.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Bulkhead Isolation</strong>: This pattern is presented while discussing microservices design principles in <em class="italic">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Applying a Microservice Architecture to Your Enterprise Application</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Cache-Aside</strong>: Caching was presented in <em class="italic">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Importance of Software Architecture</em>. Its usage with Azure Redis is also presented in <em class="italic">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Choosing Your Data Storage in the Cloud</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Circuit-Breaker</strong>: The strategy necessary to implement this is presented in <em class="italic">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Applying a Microservice Architecture to Your Enterprise Application</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Command Query Responsibility Segregation</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">CQRS</strong>): CQRS is described in <em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Different Domains in Software Solutions</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Publisher/Subscriber</strong>: This pattern will be explained in the subsections below and discussed in <em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Different Domains in Software Solutions</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Retry</strong>: The <em class="italic">resilient task execution</em> subsection of <em class="italic">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Applying a Microservice Architecture to Your Enterprise Application</em>, shows how to use Polly, a general framework for applying retries.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Queue-Based Load Leveling</strong>: The scenario presented in <em class="italic">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italic">Working with Serverless – Azure Functions</em>, uses a queue that acts as a buffer between a task and a service.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The reason why new patterns emerge is related to the challenges we face when new solutions are developed. Today, availability, data management, messaging, monitoring, performance, scalability, resiliency, and security are aspects we must deal with when delivering cloud solutions.</p>
<p class="normal">The reason why you should always consider using design patterns in development is quite simple—as a software architect, you cannot spend time reinventing the wheel. However, there is another great reason for using and understanding them—you will find many of these patterns already implemented in .NET.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next few subsections, we will cover some of the most well-known patterns. The idea of this chapter is just to let you know that they exist and need to be studied so that you can accelerate and simplify your projects. Moreover, each pattern will be presented with a C# code snippet so that you can implement it in your projects while always remembering that we are talking about samples, not code ready for production.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-127">Builder pattern</h2>
<p class="normal">There <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>are cases where you will have a complex object with different behaviors due to its configuration. Instead of setting this object up while using it, you may want to decouple its configuration from its usage, using a customized configuration that is already built. This way, you have different representations of the instances you are building. This is where you should use the Builder pattern.</p>
<p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>following class diagram shows the pattern that has been implemented for a scenario from this book’s use case, presented in <em class="italic">Chapter 21</em>,<em class="italic"> Case Study</em>. The idea behind this design choice is to simplify the way rooms from WWTravelClub are described.</p>
<p class="normal">The Fluent API implemented in the <code class="inlineCode">Room</code> class enables us to have the construction of each kind of room defined in each builder (<code class="inlineCode">SimpleRoomBuilder</code> and <code class="inlineCode">FamilyRoomBuilder</code>) more simply.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19280_06_01.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.1: Builder pattern</p>
<pre>implemented in a way where the configurations of the instances are not set in the main program. Instead, you just build the objects using the <code class="inlineCode">Build()</code> method. This example simulates the creation of different room styles (a single room and a family room) in WWTravelClub:</pre>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using DesignPatternsSample.BuilderSample;
using System;
namespace DesignPatternsSample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
          #region Builder Sample
          Console.WriteLine("Builder Sample");
          var simpleRoom = new SimpleRoomBuilder().Build();
          simpleRoom.Describe();
         
          var familyRoom = new FamilyRoomBuilder().Build();
          familyRoom.Describe();
          #endregion
          Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>result of this implementation is quite simple but clarifies the<a id="_idIndexMarker367"/> reason why you need to implement a pattern:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Text  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19280_06_02.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.2: Builder pattern sample result</p>
<p class="normal">As soon as you have the implementation, evolving this code becomes simpler. For example, if you need to build a different style of room, you can just create a new builder for that type of room, and you will be able to use it.</p>
<p class="normal">The reason why this implementation becomes quite simple is related to the usage of chaining methods, as we can see in the <code class="inlineCode">Room</code> class:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code"> public class Room
    {
        private readonly string _name;
        private bool wiFiFreeOfCharge;
        private int numberOfBeds;
        private bool balconyAvailable;
        public Room(string name)
        {
            _name = name;
        }
        public Room WithBalcony()
        {
            balconyAvailable = true;
            return this;
        }
        public Room WithBed(int numberOfBeds)
        {
            this.numberOfBeds = numberOfBeds;
            return this;
        }
        public Room WithWiFi()
        {
            wiFiFreeOfCharge = true;
            return this;
        }
    ...
    }
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Fortunately, if you <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>need to add the configuration settings for the <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>product, all the concrete classes you used previously will be defined in the Builder interface and stored there so that you can update them with ease.</p>
<p class="normal">We will see a great implementation of the Builder pattern in .NET in the <em class="italic">Understanding the design patterns available in .NET </em>section. There, you will be able to understand how Generic Host was implemented using <code class="inlineCode">HostBuilder</code>.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-128">Factory pattern</h2>
<p class="normal">The Factory pattern is useful in situations where you have multiple objects from the same abstraction, and you only know which one needs to be created at runtime. This means you will have to create the instance according to a certain configuration or according to where the software lives now.</p>
<p class="normal">For instance, let us check out the WWTravelClub sample. Here, there is a user story that describes that this application will have customers from all over the world paying for their trips. However, in the real world, there are different payment services available for each country. The process of paying is similar for each country, but this system will have more than one payment service available. A good way to simplify this payment implementation is by using the Factory pattern.</p>
<p class="normal">The following<a id="_idIndexMarker370"/> diagram shows the basic idea of its architectural implementation:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19280_06_03.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.3: Factory pattern</p>
<p class="normal">Notice<a id="_idIndexMarker371"/> that since you have an interface that describes what the payment service for the application is, you can use the Factory pattern to change the concrete class according to the services that are available:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">static void Main()
{
    #region Factory Sample
// In this sample, we will use the Factory Method Pattern
      // to create a Payment Service to charge a Brazilian
      // customer
    ProcessCharging(
    PaymentServiceFactory.ServicesAvailable.Brazilian,
    "gabriel@sample.com",
     178.90m,
     EnumChargingOptions.CreditCard);
    // In this sample, we will use the Factory Method Pattern
    // to create a Payment Service to charge an Italian
// customer
     ProcessCharging(
     PaymentServiceFactory.ServicesAvailable.Italian,
    "francesco@sample.com",
     188.70m,
     EnumChargingOptions.DebitCard);
    #endregion
    Console.ReadKey();
}
private static void ProcessCharging
    (PaymentServiceFactory.ServicesAvailable serviceToCharge,
 string emailToCharge, decimal moneyToCharge,
    EnumChargingOptions optionToCharge)
{
    PaymentServiceFactory factory = new PaymentServiceFactory();
    IPaymentService service = factory.Create(serviceToCharge);
    service.EmailToCharge = emailToCharge;
    service.MoneyToCharge = moneyToCharge;
    service.OptionToCharge = optionToCharge;
    service.ProcessCharging();
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Once again, the<a id="_idIndexMarker372"/> service’s usage has been simplified due<a id="_idIndexMarker373"/> to the implemented pattern. If you had to use this code in a real-world application, you would change the instance’s behavior by defining the service you needed in the Factory pattern.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-129">Singleton pattern</h2>
<p class="normal">When<a id="_idIndexMarker374"/> you implement Singleton in your application, you <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>will have a single instance of the object implemented in the entire solution. This is one of the most used patterns in every application. The reason is simple—there are many use cases where you need some classes to have just one instance. Singletons solve this by providing a better solution than a global variable does.</p>
<p class="normal">In the Singleton pattern, the class is responsible for creating and delivering a single object that <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>will be used by the application. In other words, the<a id="_idIndexMarker377"/> Singleton class creates a single instance:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A picture containing graphical user interface  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19280_06_04.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.4: Singleton pattern</p>
<p class="normal">To do so, the object that is created is <code class="inlineCode">static</code> and delivered in a static property or method. The <code class="inlineCode">??=</code> operator assigns the value of its right operand to its left one if its value is null.</p>
<p class="normal">The following code implements the Singleton pattern, which has a <code class="inlineCode">Message</code> property and a <code class="inlineCode">Print()</code> method:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">public sealed class SingletonDemo
{
    #region This is the Singleton definition
private static SingletonDemo _instance;
    public static SingletonDemo Current =&gt; _instance ??= new
        SingletonDemo();
    #endregion
public string Message { get; set; }
    public void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Message);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">Its usage is simple–you just need to call the static property every time you need to use the Singleton object:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">SingletonDemo.Current.Message = "This text will be printed by " +
  "the singleton. Be careful with concurrency.";
SingletonDemo.Current.Print();
</code></pre>
<div><p class="normal">Be careful because the sample can have concurrency issues according to the usage defined! Please refer to <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Non-Functional Requirements</em>, to read a bit more about concurrency and multithreading.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">One <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>of the situations where you can use this pattern is when<a id="_idIndexMarker379"/> you need to deliver the app configuration in a way that can be easily accessed from anywhere in the solution. For instance, let us say you have some configuration parameters that are stored in a table, which your app needs to query at several decision points. Although we have standard solutions like <code class="inlineCode">appsettings.json</code> or <code class="inlineCode">web.config</code>, where caching is out of the box, you may want to use this custom solution. In this case, instead of querying the configuration table directly, you can create a Singleton class to help you:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19280_06_05.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.5: Singleton pattern usage</p>
<p class="normal">Moreover, you<a id="_idIndexMarker380"/> will need to implement a cache in this Singleton, thus<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> improving the performance of the system since you will be able to decide whether the system will check each configuration in the database every time it needs it or if the cache will be used. The following screenshot shows the implementation of the cache, where the configuration is loaded every 5 seconds. The parameter that is read in this case is just a random number:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A picture containing calendar  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19280_06_06.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.6: Cache implementation inside the Singleton pattern</p>
<p class="normal">This is great <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>for the application’s performance. Besides, using<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> parameters in several places in your code is simpler since you do not have to create configuration instances everywhere in the code.</p>
<p class="normal">It is worth mentioning that due to the dependency injection implementation in .NET, Singleton pattern usage has become less common since you can set dependency injection to handle your Singleton objects. We will cover dependency injection in .NET in later sections of this chapter.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-130">Proxy pattern</h2>
<p class="normal">The Proxy pattern is <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>used when you need to provide an object that controls access to another object. One of the biggest reasons why you should do this is related to the cost of creating the object that is being controlled. For instance, if the<a id="_idIndexMarker385"/> controlled object takes too long to be created or consumes too much memory, a proxy can be used to guarantee that the largest part of the object will only be created when it is required.</p>
<p class="normal">The following class diagram is of a <strong class="keyWord">Proxy</strong> pattern implementation for loading pictures from <strong class="keyWord">Room </strong>(see <em class="italic">Figure 6.1</em>), but only when requested:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Diagram  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19280_06_07.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.7: Proxy pattern implementation</p>
<p class="normal">The client of this proxy will request its creation. Here, the proxy will only gather basic information (<code class="inlineCode">Id</code>, <code class="inlineCode">FileName</code>, and <code class="inlineCode">Tags</code>) from the real object and will not query <code class="inlineCode">PictureData</code>.</p>
<p class="normal">Only when <code class="inlineCode">PictureData</code> is requested<a id="_idIndexMarker386"/> in the first call will the proxy load it, as we can confirm with the message Now the picture is loaded!. After that, in the second picture data request, the<a id="_idIndexMarker387"/> proxy will not load the <code class="inlineCode">PictureData</code> again, which causes a better performance, as we can see in <em class="italic">Figure 6.8</em>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">static void Main()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Proxy Sample");
    ExecuteProxySample(new ProxyRoomPicture());
}
private static void ExecuteProxySample(IRoomPicture roomPicture)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Picture Id: {roomPicture.Id}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Picture FileName: {roomPicture.FileName}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Tags: {string.Join(";", roomPicture.Tags)}");
    Console.WriteLine($"1st call: Picture Data");
    Console.WriteLine($"Image: {roomPicture.PictureData}");
    Console.WriteLine($"2nd call: Picture Data");
    Console.WriteLine($"Image: {roomPicture.PictureData}");
}
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">If <code class="inlineCode">PictureData</code> is requested again, since the image data is already in place, the proxy will guarantee that image reloading will not be repeated. The following screenshot shows the result of running the preceding code:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Text  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19280_06_08.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.8: Proxy pattern result</p>
<p class="normal">This technique can be referred to by another name: <strong class="keyWord">lazy loading</strong>. In fact, the Proxy pattern is a <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>way of implementing lazy loading. Another approach for implementing lazy loading is the <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>usage of the <code class="inlineCode">Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> type. For instance, in Entity Framework Core, as discussed in <em class="italic">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">Interacting with Data in C# – Entity Framework Core</em>, you can turn on lazy loading using proxies. You can find out more about this at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data#lazy-loading">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data#lazy-loading</a>.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-131">Command pattern</h2>
<p class="normal">There are <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>many cases where you need to execute a <strong class="keyWord">command</strong> that will affect the behavior of an object. The Command pattern can help <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>you with this by encapsulating this kind of request in an object. The pattern also describes how to handle undo/redo support for a request.</p>
<div><p class="normal">There is another design pattern called Memento that also has the purpose of implementing undo actions. However, the Command pattern focuses on encapsulating requests as objects, whereas Memento focuses on capturing and externalizing an object’s internal state for the purpose of restoring it later.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">For instance, let us imagine that, on the WWTravelClub website, users can evaluate packages by specifying whether they liked, disliked, or even loved their experience.</p>
<p class="normal">The following class diagram is an example of what can be implemented to create this rating system with the Command pattern:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19280_06_09.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.9: Command pattern</p>
<p class="normal">Notice the way this pattern works – if you need a different command, such as <code class="inlineCode">Hate</code>, you will only implement a new class based on the <code class="inlineCode">ICommand</code> interface. You do not need to change the<a id="_idIndexMarker392"/> code from other action classes. The change in the <code class="inlineCode">Package</code> class will not impact the commands already implemented. Besides <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>that, if you want to implement the <code class="inlineCode">Redo</code> method, it can be added in a similar way to the <code class="inlineCode">Undo</code> method. The full code sample for this is available in this book’s GitHub repository.</p>
<p class="normal">It might also help to mention that ASP.NET Core MVC uses the Command pattern for its <code class="inlineCode">IActionResult</code> hierarchy. The business operation described in <em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Different Domains in Software Solutions</em>, will make use of this pattern to execute business rules.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-132">Publisher/Subscriber pattern</h2>
<p class="normal">Providing information from an object to a group <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>of other <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>objects is common in all applications. The Publisher/Subscriber pattern is almost mandatory when there is a large volume of components (subscribers) that will receive a message containing the information that was sent by the object (publisher).</p>
<p class="normal">The concept here is quite simple to understand and is shown in the following diagram:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="img/B19280_06_10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.10: Publisher/Subscriber sample case</p>
<p class="normal">When you have an indefinite number of different possible subscribers, it is essential to decouple the component that broadcasts information from the components that consume it. The Publisher/Subscriber pattern does this for us.</p>
<p class="normal">Implementing<a id="_idIndexMarker396"/> this pattern is complex since distributing environments is not a trivial task. Therefore, it is recommended that you consider pre-existing technologies for implementing the message broker<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> that connects the input channel to the output channels instead of building it from scratch. Azure Service Bus is a reliable infrastructure component where you can find this pattern provided, so all you need to do is connect to it.</p>
<p class="normal">RabbitMQ, which we mention in <em class="italic">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Applying a Microservice Architecture to Your Enterprise Application</em>, and in <em class="italic">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">Implementing Microservices with .NET</em>, is another service that can be used to implement a message broker, but it is a lower-level infrastructure and requires several manual implementations, such as retries in errors.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-133">Dependency Injection pattern</h2>
<p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>Dependency Injection pattern is considered a<a id="_idIndexMarker399"/> good way to implement the Dependency Inversion principle, guiding you to implement this SOLID principle.</p>
<p class="normal">The concept is quite simple. Instead of creating instances of the objects that the component depends on, you just need to define their dependencies, declare their interfaces, and enable the reception of the objects by <strong class="keyWord">injection</strong>.</p>
<p class="normal">There are three ways to perform dependency injection:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Use the constructor of the class to receive the objects</li>
<li class="bulletList">Tag some class properties to receive the objects</li>
<li class="bulletList">Define an interface with a method to inject all the necessary components</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The following diagram shows the implementation of the Dependency Injection pattern using the constructor of the class to receive the objects. In this case, it receives <code class="inlineCode">UserAddress</code> and <code class="inlineCode">DestinationAddress</code> classes, which can be completely different, but both of them implement the <code class="inlineCode">IAddress</code> interface, which enables the <strong class="keyWord">DistanceCalculator</strong> to work:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphical user interface  Description automatically generated" src="img/B19280_06_11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.11: Dependency Injection pattern</p>
<p class="normal">Apart <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>from these three ways mentioned above, Dependency Injection can be used <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>with an <strong class="keyWord">Inversion of Control</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">IoC</strong>) container. This<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> container enables the automatic injection of dependencies whenever they are asked for. There are several IoC container frameworks available on the market, but with .NET 8, for most cases, there is no need to use third-party software since it contains a set of libraries to solve this in the <code class="inlineCode">Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection</code> namespace.</p>
<p class="normal">This IoC container is responsible for creating and disposing of the objects that are requested. The implementation of Dependency Injection is based on constructor types. There are three options for the injected component’s lifetime:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Transient</strong>: The objects are created each time they are requested.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Scoped</strong>: The objects are created for each scope defined in the application. In a web app, a <strong class="keyWord">scope</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker403"/> identified with a web request unless you create a custom scope. A good example where custom scope can be used is in multi-tenant applications. In this case, you may want to manage dependencies per tenant.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Singleton</strong>: Each object has the same application lifetime, so a single object is reused to serve all the requests for a given type. If your object contains state, you should not use this one unless it is thread-safe. Remember to refer to <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>,<em class="italic"> Non-Functional Requirements</em>, to learn more about multithreading.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The way you use these options depends on the business rules of the project you are developing. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>also a matter of how you register the services of the application. You need to be careful in deciding on the correct one <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>since the behavior of the application will change according to the type of object you are injecting.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-134">Understanding the design patterns available in .NET</h1>
<p class="normal">As we <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>discovered in the previous sections, C# allows us to implement any of the patterns. .NET provides many implementations in its SDK that follow all the patterns we have discussed, such as Entity Framework Core proxy lazy loading. Another good example that has been available since .NET Core 2.1 is .NET Generic Host, which does not directly implement a specific pattern but combines many of them, providing a flexible and extensible host environment for .NET applications.</p>
<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Chapter 17</em>, <em class="italic">Presenting ASP.NET Core MVC</em>, we will detail the hosting that’s available for web apps in .NET 8. This web host helps us since the startup of the app and lifetime management are set up alongside it. The idea of .NET Generic Host is to enable this way of working for applications that do not need HTTP implementation. With this Generic Host, any .NET program can have a startup class where we can configure the dependency injection engine. This can be useful for creating multi-service apps, using Composite patterns as a basis for that.</p>
<div><p class="normal">You can find out more about .NET Generic Host at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host</a>, which contains some sample code and is the current recommendation from Microsoft.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">The code provided in the GitHub repository is simple, but it focuses on the creation of a console app that can run a service for monitoring. The great thing about this is the way the console app is set up to run, where the builder configures the services that will be provided by the application and the way logging will be managed.</p>
<p class="normal">This is shown in the following code:</p>
<pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">public static void Main()
{
    CreateHostBuilder().Build().Run();
    Console.WriteLine("Host has terminated. Press any key to finish the App.");
    Console.ReadKey();
}
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder() =&gt;
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =&gt;
    {
          services.AddHostedService&lt;HostedService&gt;();
          services.AddHostedService&lt;MonitoringService&gt;();
    })
    .ConfigureLogging((hostContext, configLogging) =&gt;
    {
          configLogging.AddConsole();
    });
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>preceding code gives us an idea of how .NET uses design patterns. Using the Builder pattern, .NET Generic Host allows you to set the classes that will be injected as services. In addition to this, the Builder pattern helps you configure some other features, such as the way logs will be shown/stored. This configuration allows the services to inject <code class="inlineCode">ILogger&lt;outTCategoryName&gt;</code> objects into any instance.</p>
<p class="normal">Other examples of Generic Host usage are worker services, described in <em class="italic">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">Implementing Microservices with .NET</em>, and Blazor’s Generic Host, described in <em class="italic">Chapter 19, Client Frameworks: Blazor</em>.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-135">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we understood why design patterns help with the maintainability and reusability of the parts of the system you are building. We also looked at some typical use cases and code examples that you can consider in your projects, always remembering that they need to evolve to achieve professional delivery. Finally, we presented .NET Generic Host, which is a good example of how .NET uses design patterns to enable code reusability and enforce best practices.</p>
<p class="normal">All this content will help you while architecting new software or even maintaining something existing since design patterns are already-known solutions for some real-life problems in software development.</p>
<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Diﬀerent Domains in Software Solutions</em>, we will cover the domain-driven design approach. We will also learn how to use the SOLID design principles so that we can map different domains to our software solutions.</p>
