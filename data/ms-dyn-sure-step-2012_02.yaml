    for the selection and delivery of business solutions. We discussed the benefits
    of having a methodology for both the service provider and the customer. Not only
    does a methodology provide a consistent and repeatable approach via workflows
    and processes, but it also provides a connection to the various disciplines, and
    the orchestration of multiple roles that are involved in solution delivery execution.

    the notion of full life cycle methodologies. A customer life cycle methodology
    encompasses the solution discovery phase, solution delivery phases, and continues
    through the operation and any future upgrades of the solution. Beginning with
    the discovery phase, a full life cycle methodology provides a structured process
    for solution evaluation as well as proper dissemination of the knowledge that
    is captured during the diagnostic phase through to the solution delivery phases,
    thereby ensuring that the final solution design aligns with the original solution
    vision.

    Period! As we discussed in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Background and Concepts"),
    *Background and Concepts*, ERP and CRM solutions are mission critical because
    of the core functions that they support, including quote-to-order entry, order
    fulfillment, receipts and payments, HR and payroll, inventory management, demand
    forecasting and sales pipeline, and customer relationship management. Based on
    the number of organizational functions that interface with these solutions and
    the extent to which they depend on these systems, it is easy to see the impact
    of the system on that organization. A good sales team will articulate this value
    during the sales cycle, and position the solution in terms of metrics that the
    customer can relate to.

    when there is a value associated with the solution. Executive support is absolutely
    critical for a project of such magnitude, both in the solution selection stage

    the solution delivery team is bound to go through peaks and valleys. When there
    are clearly defined value projections, these will be the drivers and motivation
    factors for the team to keep forging ahead through its struggles.

- en: The most important aspect of driving value for the customer is ensuring that
    the right solution is being positioned to meet the organizational requirements.
    A good sales team always keeps its customer's needs at the forefront. Always strive
    to do what's best for the customers and their organization, even if it means walking
    away from an opportunity if you determine that it is not the right fit for your
    solution. This is where ethics come in, but when sales teams follow this thought
    process, they will have appreciative and loyal customers. And over the long run,
    they will end up on the winning side, and be able to feel good about their accomplishments.

    influence of quotas and bonuses on sales behavior. However, by aligning the right
    solution for the customer, the sales personnel can get their individual goals
    accomplished while also helping organizations achieve their potential. This should
    give them a sense of gratification that extends well beyond the period-end bonuses.
    Long-term values can be achieved through a due-diligence process that engages

    Quite simply, the word "solution" means an answer to a problem. But the English

    resolution, and result. All of these definitions fit quite nicely into the constructs
    of business-solution selling, and therein lies the crux of the issue—"solution"
    can mean different things to different people. Because a solution can be applied

    "solutions" and that they are "solutions-focused" as this apparently takes away
    the negative connotation associated with the term "products". A product is viewed
    as an offering that the selling company is forcing on the marketplace, while a
    solution is viewed as something that the marketplace is actively seeking, with
    the solution being the answer that the sellers can offer to the buyers. So, is
    the product the antithesis of a solution? Far from it! In many cases, and especially
    in the context of business solutions, the product is the primary driver of the
    solution. But it is the usage or delivery of that product that can truly define
    the success or failure of the solution for the customer. And the up-front positioning

    that "solution–centric organizations define themselves by the problems they solve
    for customers versus by the products or services they make, sell or deliver".

- en: So, how then does a company become truly solution-centric? As SPI puts it, for
    a true solution-centric approach, organizations need to embrace a sustained business
    model to market, sell, and deliver customer transformation. They need to identify
    the problems they solve rather than the products they offer, align all of the
    aspects of their marketing with the solution framework, and systemically adopt
    and reinforce the solution selling and solution-centric disciplines across the
    entire organization. Companies doing this will find themselves being able to consistently
    position the value of their solutions to their customers to clearly differentiate
    the value vis-à-vis their competition, and create a business model for sustainable
    growth.

    action. While the former is a better process for the service providers' sales
    personnel, the latter is a better mechanism for the customers in their product-selection
    process. So, a good solution selling process aids the solution provider while
    innately assisting the customer and ensuring a thorough due diligence process,
    which in turn sets the stage for a good solution delivery process. Granted that
    there will always be the likelihood of the process being skewed towards the product
    that the solution provider is representing, however, if the process is conducted
    properly, the customer should be able to clearly determine the extent of the fit
    between their requirements and the solution, as well as what their future solution
    will look like.

    or service that they are acquiring is the best solution to their problem, and
    they are getting it at the best possible price. As the magnitude of the purchase
    increases, so does the buyer's inclination to research on the marketplace to seek
    out the right solution at the right price for their needs. Essentially, the length
    of the due diligence process for the buyer increases exponentially with the importance
    of their requirement. However, there is one more factor that can affect the buyer's
    due diligence process, and that is trust—trust that the solution will meet their
    needs, trust in the sellers that they are providing the best price, trust that
    the sellers will deliver the promised solution, and trust that the sellers have
    the wherewithal to support the solution, should any problems arise after the delivery.

    is trustworthy, and the organization supporting the solution will be around for
    the long haul. But let's assume that all things are equal or close enough that
    the differentiation is not obvious—for example, the competition also has a mature
    solution as well as trustworthy and personable sales personnel. The key point
    in Bosworth's notion is that when the sellers can make the buyers feel that the
    solution is theirs and matches their vision, the buyers feel that they are in
    control of the process, and they are empowered.

- en: Bosworth's teaching ties the buyer's needs to the solution-visioning process.
    As the customers move through their buying cycle, their concerns change over time.
    It is then important that the seller stays aligned with the customers, and advance
    the vision in lockstep with the buyer. When the buyer is able to clearly visualize
    and articulate the future outcomes of the seller's solution, the sale becomes
    less complicated, resulting in shorter sales cycles and higher close ratios.

    they are trying to solve. To develop a win-win relationship with your customer,
    you must understand what it means for them to win, or in other words, what a successful
    solution means to them. Follow the "principles of empathetic communication" by
    outlining the objectives in terms of the customer''s needs and wants. This allows

    could request a proof of concept after the solution vision has been developed.
    Also, the seller can avoid having to discuss any specific pricing questions that

    it is better for the seller to avoid detailed pricing discussions, and instead
    stay at a rough order of magnitude level. When the customer sees the solution

- en: So, how do you prevent the urge to start with show and tell? The answer lies
    in solution selling, where you methodically diagnose the customer's requirements,
    and in concert with the buyer, you build the solution blueprint, which will, of
    course, be biased towards your solution. Also, in using this approach, you will
    develop a solution selling benefit statement that is a composite statement of
    the features, advantages, and benefits of the solution. This is not to say that
    the customer will jump into a requirements assessment stage without even knowing
    the solution that the seller is offering. This is to differentiate between an
    early "vision" demo and a custom "proof" demo. The early vision demos are typically
    pre-scripted demos to articulate the solution capabilities, and help in articulating
    the solution features to build the solution vision for the buyer. When the buyer
    and seller reach the point where they share a joint vision, that's the stage for
    the proof demo. Proof demos can trigger time and resource constraints for the
    seller's organization, and hence should only be resorted to when there is a joint
    buyer-seller vision, which can be shown in the form of a solution selling benefit
    statement.

  zh: 那么，如何防止一开始就急于展示和讲述的冲动呢？答案在于解决方案销售，在这里你系统地诊断客户的需求，并与买家一起构建解决方案蓝图，当然，这个蓝图将偏向于你的解决方案。此外，采用这种方法，你将开发出一个解决方案销售的利益声明，这是一个关于解决方案特性、优势和利益的复合声明。这并不是说客户会在甚至不知道卖家提供的解决方案的情况下，跳到需求评估阶段。这是要区分早期“愿景”演示和定制“证明”演示。早期的愿景演示通常是预先编排的演示，用于阐述解决方案的能力，并帮助阐述解决方案特性，为买家构建解决方案愿景。当买家和卖家达到共享共同愿景的阶段时，那就是证明演示的时候了。证明演示可能会触发卖家组织的时资源和约束，因此只有在存在联合买家-卖家愿景的情况下，才应该采取这种做法，这可以通过解决方案销售的利益声明来展示。

    addresses the vision that was developed through active participation by both the
    buyer and seller. As Bosworth puts it, the statement will indicate the prospect:
    *who will be doing what, when in time via a product or service*. So, in effect,
    the seller has corroborated with the buyer that there is a Level 3 need, meaning
    that the buyer has participated in the development of the solution vision. If
    the buyer is still at Level 2 or an earlier level, and the need or pain is still
    undeveloped or latent, the best that the seller can do is to develop an advantage
    statement. The **advantage statement** can list only the benefits from the eyes
    of the seller as they still don''t know the detailed pain points of the buyer.

    as the seller is starting anew with the buyer, it is important to understand that
    these techniques also apply to situations where the buyer already has an initial
    vision in mind. This is a key point especially in the business solutions arena,
    where it is becoming commonplace for a solution provider to get engaged at the
    **Request for Proposal** (**RFP**) or **Request for Information** (**RFI**) stage.
    At this stage, the customer may have already engaged with an independent third-party
    consulting group to come up with their initial requirements. It is also possible
    that they could have engaged with a competitor for this. Obviously, the latter
    situation is not ideal as the requirements are already fashioned with a bias towards
    the competitor's solution, and the seller needs to do some investigation to ascertain
    that it is indeed still fair competition at that point. Keep in mind that if the
    buyer is merely going through the exercise to show their management that they
    completed the requisite steps for their due diligence by analyzing a preset number
    of solutions, it may be better for the seller to not waste too much of their time.
    But if it is still open competition, the seller can still use the same techniques

    stage is to move customer leads identified for the business solutions via sales
    calls, mailers, Internet marketing, conferences, or other means into the opportunity
    management cycle as a prospect to arouse interest in the solutions. Sales teams
    create account plans and research typical customer pain points in the industry.
    They also gather customer success stories as an evidence of past success in the
    space.

    latent needs. The sales team helps the customer by ascertaining the business drivers,
    and starts working towards developing a shared vision. This is also the stage
    where the sales teams will ensure that there is a business sponsor for the initiative,
    as well as look to negotiate access to the power sponsor.

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, we introduced and discussed the concepts of solution selling.
    Solution selling helps the seller stay aligned with their buyers by building a
    trusting relationship and a common vision of the solution that meets the customer's
    needs. We also presented the different techniques that we can afford to enable
    solution selling, including value measurement, vision processing, and the phases
    of the buying cycle. Finally, we covered MSSP, the solution selling process that
    Microsoft designed to help its partners and internal sales teams.

- en: There continues to be new theories espousing the evolution of solution selling.
    They are certainly worth investigating and forming your own opinions on how to
    adapt your selling techniques. Regardless of your approach, we are selling business
    solutions, and these are mission-critical systems to run the company's business.
    The sellers' responsibility then is to understand what the customers' needs are
    through a discovery process, and match the solution to their needs. The time span
    for the said discovery process can of course vary depending on where the customer
    is in their evaluation and buy cycle. But it doesn't absolve us from the need
    to follow a process for solution envisioning. The CEO/CFO/COO/CIO levels are the
    ultimate decision-makers—so you don't just go in and tell them how to run their
    business. But they do expect you to provide them with the best practices from
    your experience with other similar businesses, and solutions that fit their business.

  zh: 持续有新的理论宣扬解决方案销售的发展。它们当然值得调查，并形成你自己的观点，了解如何调整你的销售技巧。无论你的方法如何，我们都在销售商业解决方案，这些是运行公司业务的至关重要的系统。因此，销售者的责任是通过发现过程了解客户的需求，并将解决方案与他们的需求相匹配。这个发现过程的时间跨度当然会根据客户在评估和购买周期中的位置而变化。但这并不能免除我们遵循解决方案愿景过程的需求。CEO/CFO/COO/CIO级别是最终的决策者——所以你不仅仅走进去告诉他们如何经营他们的业务。但他们确实期望你能提供你在其他类似业务中的经验最佳实践，以及适合他们业务的解决方案。
