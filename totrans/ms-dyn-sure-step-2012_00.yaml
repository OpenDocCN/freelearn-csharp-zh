    solutions support a wide range of business processes for an organization. These
    processes include core financials and accounting, product engineering, sales force
    automation, sales order management, supply chain planning, order fulfillment and
    logistics, as well as after-sales service and support. Many of these are mission
    critical for the companies, and hence the rigor that these organizations go through
    to ensure that they find the right solution for their needs.

    called Microsoft Dynamics Sure Step to help the customers accomplish their objectives.
    First and foremost among those goals was to provide processes to enable consistent
    and repeatable solution deployments. Inherent within that, however, was the need
    to ensure that the customer and sales team engaged in a meaningful manner to select
    the right solution, and ensured that the project was scoped such that the customer's
    objectives would be met.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Background and Concepts"), *Background and
    Concepts*, introduces the importance of a methodology in the selection and implementation
    of ERP and CRM solutions. A faulty selection process can derail any solution deployment,
    and it is important for the readers to understand what they can do to prevent
    this. Many implementations also go awry because of poor scope and risk and change
    management, and we begin to talk about this key aspect. We also set the context
    with a brief history of the Microsoft Dynamics solutions, from acquisition through
    their evolution into the current world-leading portfolio.'

    *Solution Selling and Driving Due Diligence*, focuses on the theories and approaches
    to selling business solutions. We also discuss the buyer''s progression in their
    cycle of solution acquisition. From the solution provider''s perspective, solution
    selling requires them to build a relationship with their customer and establish
    trust. We also talk about establishing key performance indicators and the value
    measurement for the solution while helping to drive customer vision and scope,
    and close the sale. From the customer''s perspective, we talk about becoming a
    solution-centric organization, do proper due diligence in selecting the right
    solution to meet their needs, and ensure that the scope for the delivery engagement
    is set up to accomplish the organization''s objectives.'

    We talk about the waterfall and agile approaches afforded by Sure Step. In the

    In doing so, we illustrate the real-life challenges that implementers and customers
    face when implementing ERP and CRM software solutions and ways to address these
    challenges. With the agile approach, we discuss how this flexible and iterative
    approach is organized and how it supports the solution delivery.'
