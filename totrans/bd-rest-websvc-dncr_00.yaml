- en: This book will take the readers through the design of RESTful web services and
    leverages the ASP.NET Core Framework to implement these services. Starting from
    the basics of the philosophy behind REST, the readers will go through the steps
    of designing and implementing an enterprise-grade RESTful web service. Taking
    a practical approach, each chapter provides code samples that they can apply to
    your own circumstances. It brings forth the power of the latest .NET Core release,
    working with MVC. It then goes beyond the use of the framework to explore approaches
    to tackle resilience, security, and scalability concerns. The readers will learn
    techniques to deal with security in Web APIs and discover how to implement unit
    and integration test strategies. Finally, the book ends by walking you through
    building a .NET client for your RESTful web service, along with some scaling techniques.
