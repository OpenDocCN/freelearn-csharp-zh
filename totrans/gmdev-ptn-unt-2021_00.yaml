- en: The preceding quote is from one of my favorite films and sums up my approach
    to learning. Following over a decade working in the gaming industry, I have found
    that the only proper way to gain mastery over a complex system is by breaking
    it down into its most basic components. In other words, I try to understand the
    core ingredients before mastering the final form. Throughout this book, you will
    see that I'm taking a simplistic, but contextual, approach in presenting each
    pattern.

- en: The goal is not to dumb down the subject matter but learn by isolating the core
    concepts behind each design pattern so that we can observe them and learn their
    intricacies. I've learned this approach in the gaming industry while working as
    a designer and programmer. We will often build components and systems for our
    game in isolated levels that we call *gyms*. We would spend weeks iterating, testing,
    and adjusting each ingredient of our game individually until we understood how
    to make them work as a whole. I wrote this book in a way that's consistent with
    how I approach game development so you, as a reader, can immerse yourself in the
    subject matter while adopting some good habits along the way that will help you
    in your career.

- en: However, it is also important to state that the content of this book is not
    the ultimate reference regarding patterns in Unity. It's just an introduction
    to the subject matter, not the final destination of the learning process. I'm
    not presenting myself as the foremost expert and do not wish my words to become
    gospel among developers. I'm just a developer trying to find an elegant way of
    using standard software design patterns in Unity and want to share what I discovered. Therefore,
    as the reader, I encourage you to critique, research, customize, and improve upon
    everything presented throughout this book.

- en: 'While writing this book, I decided on a specific mental model of my target
    audience, for the main reason that it''s almost impossible to write a book about
    game development and satisfy every potential type of reader, primarily because
    game development is a diverse industry and there are so many types of platforms
    and genres, each with their specific characteristics, that I cannot take into
    account in a single book. So I decided on focusing the content on a particular
    kind of audience, which I can describe as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*The target audience is game programmers who are currently working on a mobile
    or indie game project in the Unity engine and who are in the process of refactoring
    their code to make it more maintainable and scalable. The reader should have a
    basic understanding of Unity and the C# language.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Senior programmers working on large-scale AAA or MMO games might find particular
    examples in this book limited compared to the architectural challenges they usually
    face daily. However, on the other hand, the content of this book might offer another
    perspective on the use of design patterns in Unity. So feel free to skip any chapter
    if you already know the theory and want to see how I implemented a specific pattern.
