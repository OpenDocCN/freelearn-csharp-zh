    are essential aspects of the solution-delivery process to ensure that the solution
    being developed is in line with the expectations of the customer. *Dr. W. Edwards
    Deming* was one of the pioneers of the quality revolution, first in Japan, then
    in the United States, and then the rest of the world. Dr. Deming's teachings and
    philosophies originated in manufacturing, but have been extended to several disciplines
    over time, and his works have been produced and reproduced via a number of books
    and articles. Dr. Deming emphasized how quality and efficiency can improve simultaneously,
    by creating "a consistency of purpose designed to drive the organization towards
    product and service improvement and continually and permanently improving the
    system."

- en: Within the Sure Step implementation project types, the execution of quality
    management is often emphasized and entrusted to senior roles like the project
    manager, solution architect, and tester. These roles assume leadership of the
    solution-delivery process, and as such it is seen as a natural extension of their
    roles to oversee the quality aspects of solution delivery. Accordingly, key activities
    in the **Program Management** and **Quality and Testing** cross phases are specifically
    called out to monitor the quality of the implementation, with the project manager,
    solution architect, and so on, as the *owners* of the execution of the deliverables.
    In the Program Management cross phase, key quality-focused activities include
    the documentation of **Conditions of Satisfaction** (**CoS**) and the execution
    of **Tollgate Reviews**. The Quality and Testing cross phase includes activities
    early in the delivery cycle to ensure that Quality Standards are established.
    Additionally, Monitoring and Testing activities are essential elements of this
    cross phase, with activities called out in each phase.

- en: Conditions of Satisfaction are the measures of project success and the goals
    for the engagement that allow the teams to clearly determine success or failure
    of the project. The guidance in Sure Step calls for the elements of CoS to be
    identified at the outset of the engagement, and are noted within the **Project
    Charter** or in a similar project documentation. The project manager is responsible
    for working with the customer to ensure that this activity is executed, and also
    to ensure that the document is signed off by the customer, thereby denoting their
    acceptance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another key component of quality control during the implementation is Tollgate
    Reviews. For the Waterfall project types, the executions of Tollgate Reviews are
    called out at the end of each phase. For the Agile project type, Tollgate Reviews
    take the form of the Sprint Post Mortem, which is executed at the end of each
    sprint cycle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tollgate Reviews in the Waterfall project types assess the current health of
    the project by reviewing the key milestones achieved and key deliverables completed
    during the corresponding phase. Any project issues and risks are also identified,
    documented, and a course for mitigating them is established. This may include
    a project scope and change requests to be initiated, and an approval is requested
    from the customer. Any adjustments to the overall timeline of the project are
    also performed during this activity. Tollgate Reviews are also used to assess
    how the project is faring in terms of addressing the Conditions of Satisfaction
    identified by the customer.

    are needed before the next sprint cycle is initiated.

    after the Unit Test, the Function Test is conducted by the application consultant
    to verify that the marketing department's functional need is being met by the
    customization. This may involve, for example, verifying that the field is placed
    on the corresponding form at the right location, and the appropriate values are
    available to the marketing personnel.

- en: The need for such rigor in testing is evident from the examples noted here.
    However, if the reader concludes that the number of tests seems to be too much
    overhead for smaller engagements, they may consider combining tests where feasible.
    However, for large-scale engagements, which may have several hundred simple and
    complex requirements, this rigor is necessary; so the reader is strongly advised
    against taking any shortcuts that may pose unnecessary risks. Skipping the individual
    tests may lead to issues being detected downstream in the process. As any experienced
    consultant would tell you, it is better to test a smaller subset of the solution
    so as to isolate any potential issues. The alternative, which is more time consuming
    and laborious, is to test all the setups together to try to determine if the problem
    lies in a single subset of code, or is due to the intersection with another element
    of code. In that sense, you could draw a parallel to a manufacturing process.
    In multi-part manufacturing, it is critical to detect quality issues during the
    manufacture of the components. Waiting until assembly to discover parts that don't
    fit will likely shut down the assembly line and lead to expensive delays. Just
    as in the manufacturing process, testing the individual code components is important
    during the solution development, before the solution is tested as a whole.

    entering a customer order, fulfilling the order, and accepting payment for the
    order, including alerting the appropriate Customer Service personnel when the
    payments are overdue. In the Procure-to-Pay Process Test, the SMEs verify that
    they can place a Purchase Order with their suppliers as per their design, they
    can receive and account for the delivery of the supplies, and they are able to
    pay the suppliers for their goods within the appropriate payment conventions of
    the organization.

    The second objective of the DAT is validating that all of the data needed for
    transactions, inquiry, and reporting is available. DAT should be performed by
    the customer's data owners and key users who are closest to the data elements

    implementation team, or in other words, situational fluency. The team must have
    the ability to translate the system functionality into a solution that meets the
    specific needs of the customer. When a customer selects a service provider for
    their solution implementation, they often add extra weight to industry knowledge.
    So what if it comes down to a service provider that is very knowledgeable in the
    specific industry or industry vertical, but is not quite as familiar with the
    Microsoft Dynamics solution? This is one area where the Technical Review services
    can greatly benefit both the service provider and customer. The marriage of seasoned
    industry veterans with technical Microsoft Dynamics experts can provide a powerful
    team to solve deep, topical requirements for the customer.
  prefs: []

    especially the Proactive Review services, can benefit is with new ERP/CRM service
    providers getting started with Microsoft Dynamics. Inexperienced service providers
    can include experienced resources on their team by using these offerings, and
    as the team members *shadow* the experienced resources, they can ramp up on their
    understanding of the Microsoft Dynamics solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where the service providers already possess deep technical expertise but are
    short on project management expertise, especially on large-scale engagements,
    the Project Governance and Delivery Review service can be of great benefit. The
    Microsoft Dynamics resource pool includes several individuals with knowledge of
    the solutions prior to their acquisition by Microsoft. While these technical resources
    are very knowledgeable about the product itself, they sometimes lack the experience
    to manage the scope, communications, and risks inherent in complex, multisite
    solution deployments. Leveraging the PGDR offering, these resources can work with
    experienced project managers to develop that skill set for future engagements.
    They can, in turn, lead their organizations to scale up their offerings to address
    larger clientele.

- en: The Post Go-Live services, including the Health Check and Performance Tuning
    services, are highly recommended for the customer. Given the substantial investment
    made in acquiring and deploying the Microsoft Dynamics solution, it behooves the
    customer to periodically get expert resources to monitor the health of the application.
    Depending on usage behavior, the application can feel like it bogs down over time,
    and the system response may appear slower to the users. The Post Go-Live services
    can then be used to review the application and the subsequent recommendations
    can help clean up the system to perform more efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From a service provider's perspective, the Post Go-Live services can be exercised
    to continue maintaining their relationship with their customer. A common paradigm
    noted in the industry is that it is harder to get a new customer than to keep
    an existing one. It is also next to impossible to gain a customer back once they
    are lost to the competition. As such, the service provider should leverage the
    Health Check offerings to further their relationship with their customers. In
    doing so, they may also unearth new related or unrelated opportunities on which
    they may assist the customer.
