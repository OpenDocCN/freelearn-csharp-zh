<p>Since Unity 4.6 in 2014, Unity has shipped with dedicated 2D features, and Unity 2018 continues to build on these. In this chapter, we present a range of recipes to introduce the basics of 2D animation in Unity 2018, and help you understand the relationships between the different animation elements.</p>

<p>In Unity 2D, animations can be created in several different ways—one way is to create many images, each slightly different, which frame-by-frame give the appearance of movement. A second way to create animations is by defining keyframe positions for individual parts of an object (for example, the arms, legs, feet, head, and eyes), and getting Unity to calculate all the in-between positions when the game is running:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/14375113-9416-4625-868a-71ac9dab7360.png"/></p>
<p>Both sources of animations become <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clips</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Animation</span> panel. Each <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span> then becomes a <span class="packt_screen">State</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Animator Controller State Machine</span>. We can also duplicate <span class="packt_screen">States</span> based on <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clips</span>, or create new <span class="packt_screen">States</span>, and add scripted <span class="packt_screen">Behaviors</span>.</p>
<p>We also can define sophisticated <span class="packt_screen">Conditions</span>, under which GameObject will <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> from one animation <span class="packt_screen">State</span> to another.</p>

<p>Unity has introduced a set of <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span> features that makes creating <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span>-based <strong>Scenes</strong> quick and easy. A <span class="packt_screen">Tile Grid</span> GameObject acts as the parent to <span class="packt_screen">Tilemaps</span>. <span class="packt_screen">Tilemaps</span> are the GameObjects onto which <span class="packt_screen">Tiles</span> are painted, from the <span class="packt_screen">Tile Palette</span> panel. <span class="packt_screen">Sprites</span> can be made into <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span> assets, and a collection of <span class="packt_screen">Tiles</span> can be added to form a <span class="packt_screen">Tile Palette</span> from which to paint a Scene.</p>
<p>It also offers powerful, scripted <span class="packt_screen">Rule Tiles</span> that enhance the <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span> brush tools, automatically adding top, left, right, and bottom edge <span class="packt_screen">Tiles</span> as more <span class="packt_screen">Grid</span> elements are painted with Tiles. <span class="packt_screen">Rule Tiles</span> can even randomly choose from a selection of <span class="packt_screen">Tiles</span> under defined conditions.

<p>Perhaps the most exciting 2D feature introduced by Unity is the <span class="packt_screen">2D GameKit</span>. This brings together several powerful Unity features for constructing 2D games, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Tilemaps</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Rule Tiles</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Character Controller 2D</span> (and Input <span class="packt_screen">Mapper</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Player Character</span> components)</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Cinemachine</span> intelligent camera control</li>
<li>The Unity event system</li>
<li>Many prefabricated common 2D game components, including doors, teleporters, dialog panels, switches, inventory, melee, collectables and inventory, damageables, and enemies and much more</li>
</ul>
<p>The final recipe in this chapter introduces the <span class="packt_screen">2D GameKit</span>, and the other recipes in this chapter, and some others, introduce some of the components individually, so that you'll know enough to start taking your first steps with the <span class="packt_screen">2D GameKit</span> and learning how to build Scenes that tightly combine core 2D game features.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we introduce recipes demonstrating the animation system for 2D game elements. The PotatoMan2D character is from the Unity 2D Platformer, which you can download yourself from the Unity asset store. That project is a good place to see lots more examples of 2D game and animation techniques:</p>

<p>Perhaps the simplest 2D animation is a simple flip, from facing left to facing right, or facing up to facing down, and so on. In this recipe, we'll add a cute bug sprite to the scene, and write a short script to flip its horizontal direction when the <em>L<span class="KeyPACKT">eft</span></em> and <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Right</span></em> arrow keys are pressed:</p>

<p>To flip an object horizontally with arrow key presses, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">If you are working in a project that was originally created in 3D, you can change the default project behavior (for example, new <span class="packt_screen">Sprite Textures</span> and <strong>Scene</strong> mode) to 2D via menu: <span class="packt_screen">Edit | Project Settings | Editor</span>, then choose 2D for the <span class="packt_screen">Default Behavior Mode</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span>.</div>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9e5f36aa-c081-4587-8f58-2eadd2776b15.png"/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Import the provided image: <span class="packt_screen">EnemyBug.png</span>.</li>
<li>Drag an instance of the red <span class="packt_screen">Enemy Bug</span> image from the <span class="packt_screen">Project | Sprites</span> folder into the <strong>Scene</strong>. Position this GameObject at (<span class="packt_screen">0, 0, 0</span>) and scale to (<span class="packt_screen">2, 2, 2</span>).</li>
<li>Create a C# script-class named <span class="packt_screen">BugFlip</span>, and add an instance-object as a component to the <span class="packt_screen">Enemy Bug</span>:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">     using UnityEngine;<br/>     using System.Collections;<br/><br/>     public class BugFlip : MonoBehaviour {<br/>       private bool facingRight = true;<br/><br/>       void Update() {<br/>         if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.LeftArrow) &amp;&amp; facingRight)<br/>           Flip ();<br/>         if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.RightArrow) &amp;&amp; !facingRight)<br/>           Flip();<br/>       }<br/><br/>       void Flip (){<br/>         // Switch the way the player is labelled as facing.<br/>         facingRight = !facingRight;<br/><br/>         // Multiply the player's x local scale by -1.<br/>         Vector3 theScale = transform.localScale;<br/>         theScale.x *= -1;<br/>         transform.localScale = theScale;<br/>       }<br/>     } </pre>

            <article>
                
<p>The C# class defines a <strong>Boolean</strong> variable, <kbd>facingRight</kbd>, that stores a <span class="packt_screen">true/false</span> value corresponding to whether or not the bug is facing right. Since our bug sprite is initially facing right, we set the initial value of <kbd>facingRight</kbd> to true to match this.</p>
<p>Every frame, the <kbd>Update()</kbd> method, checks to see whether the <em>Left</em> or <em>Righ</em>t arrow keys have been pressed. If the <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Left</span></em> arrow key is pressed and the bug is facing right, then the <kbd>Flip()</kbd> method is called, likewise if the <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Right</span></em> arrow key is pressed and the bug is facing left (that is, facing right is false), again the <kbd>Flip()</kbd> method is called.</p>
<p>The <kbd>Flip()</kbd> method performs two actions; the first simply reverses the true/false value in variable <kbd>facingRight</kbd>. The second action changes the +/- sign of the X-value of the <kbd>localScale</kbd> property of the transform. Reversing the sign of the <kbd>localScale</kbd> results in the 2D flip that we desire. Look inside the PlayerControl script for the PotatoMan character in the next recipe <span>–</span> you'll see the same <kbd>Flip()</kbd> method being used.</p>

<p>In this recipe, we'll use (in a simple way) the Unity animation system to create two states corresponding to two animation clips, and a script that changes localScale according to which animation state is active. We'll use a second script, which will map the arrow keys press <span class="packt_screen">Horizontal</span> input axis values to a <span class="packt_screen">Parameter</span> in the state chart, and which will drive the transition from one state to the other.</p>
<p>While it may seem like a lot of work, compared to the previous recipe, such an approach illustrates how we can map from input events (such as key presses or touch inputs), to <span class="packt_screen">Parameters</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Triggers</span> in a <span class="packt_screen">State Chart</span>.</p>

<p>To flip an object horizontally using <span class="packt_screen">Animator State Chart</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Transitions</span>, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>Import the provided image: <span class="packt_screen">EnemyBug.png</span>.</li>
<li>Drag an instance of the red <span class="packt_screen">Enemy Bug</span> image from the <span class="packt_screen">Project | Sprites</span> folder into the scene. Position this GameObject at (<span class="packt_screen">0, 0, 0</span>) and scale to (<span class="packt_screen">2, 2, 2</span>).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>With the <span class="packt_screen">Enemy Bug</span> GameObject selected in <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, open the <strong>Animation</strong> panel (menu: <span class="packt_screen">Window | Animation | Animation</span>), and click the <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> button to create a new <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span> asset. Save the new <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span> asset as <span class="packt_screen">beetle-right</span>. You will also see that an <span class="packt_screen">Animator</span> component has been added to the <span class="packt_screen">Enemy Bug</span> GameObject:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/12056ee9-9a17-40cc-9a19-abdaa840bcd8.png"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>If you look at the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> panel, you'll see two new asset files have been created: the <span class="packt_screen">beetle-right </span><span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span> and an <span class="packt_screen">Animator Controller</span> named <span class="packt_screen">Enemy Bug</span>:</li>

<ol start="6">
<li>Close the <strong>Anim</strong><strong>ation</strong> panel, and double click the <span class="packt_screen">Enemy Bug Animator Controller</span> to start editing it <span>–</span> it should appear in a new <strong>Animator</strong> panel. You should see four <em>states</em>, <span class="packt_screen">Any State</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Exit</span> are unlinked, and state <span class="packt_screen">Entry</span> has a <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> arrow connecting to <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span><span class="packt_screen">beetle-right</span>. This means that as soon as the <span class="packt_screen">Animator Controller</span> starts to play, it will enter the <span class="packt_screen">beetle-right</span> state. State <span class="packt_screen">beetle-right</span> is tinted orange, to indicate that it is the <span class="packt_screen">Default</span> state.</li>

<ol start="7">
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">be</span><span class="packt_screen">etle-right</span> state and make a copy of it, renaming the copy <span class="packt_screen">beetle-left</span> (use can use the right-mouse menu, or the <span class="KeyPACKT"><em>Ctrl </em>+ <em>C</em>/<em>V</em></span> keyboard shortcuts). It makes sense to position <span class="packt_screen">beetle-left</span> to the <strong>left</strong> of <span class="packt_screen">beetle-right</span>:</li>

In this case, the defaults, <span class="packt_screen">axisHorizontal </span><span class="packt_screen">Greater</span> than <span class="packt_screen">zero</span>, are just what we want (since a positive value is returned by Unity's input system <span class="packt_screen">Horizontal</span> axis when the <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Right</span></em> arrow key is pressed).</li>
<li>We need a method to actually map from the Unity input system's <span class="packt_screen">Horizontal</span> axis value (from the <span class="KeyPACKT"><em>Left/Right</em> </span>array keys) to our <span class="packt_screen">Animator</span> state chart <span class="packt_screen">Parameter</span><span class="packt_screen">axisHorizontal</span>.

<ol start="16">
<li>Now we need to actually change the local scale property of the GameObject when we switch to the left or right facing state. Create a C# script class named <span class="packt_screen">LocalScaleSetter</span>:</li>

<pre style="padding-left: 60px">    using UnityEngine;<br/><br/>     public class LocalScaleSetter : StateMachineBehaviour  {<br/>         public Vector3 scale = Vector3.one;<br/><br/>         override public void OnStateEnter(Animator animator, AnimatorStateInfo stateInfo, int layerIndex) {<br/>             animator.transform.localScale = scale;<br/>         }<br/><br/>     } </pre>

<p>Each frame the <kbd>Update()</kbd> method of the <kbd><span class="packt_screen">InputMapper</span></kbd> <span>C# script-class r</span><span>eads the Unity input system's</span> <span class="packt_screen">Horizontal</span> <span>axis value each frame, and sets the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Animator</span> <span>state chart</span> <span class="packt_screen">Parameter</span><span class="packt_screen">axisHorizontal</span> <span>to this value. If the value is less than (left arrow) or greater than (right arrow) zero, if appropriate, the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Animator</span> <span>state system will switch to the other state.</span></p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">LocalScaleSetter</span> <span>C# script class</span><span> actually changes the</span> <span class="packt_screen">localScale</span> <span>property (initial value</span> <span class="packt_screen">1,1,1</span><span>, or reflect horizontally to make it face left</span> <span class="packt_screen">-1,1,1</span><span>). For each state the public <strong>Vector3</strong> variable can be customized to the appropriate values.</span></p>
<p><span>The</span> <kbd>OnStateEnter(...)</kbd> method <span>is involved each time you enter the state that an instance object of this C# class is attached to. You can read about the various event messages for the StateMachineBehaviour class at</span> <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/StateMachineBehaviour.html"><span class="URLPACKT">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/StateMachineBehaviour.html</span></a>.</p>
<p>When we press the <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Left</span></em>-arrow key, the value of the Unity input system's <span class="packt_screen">Horizontal</span> axis value is negative, and this is mapped to the <span class="packt_screen">Animator</span> state chart, <span class="packt_screen">Parameter axisHorizontal</span>, causing the system to <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> to the <span class="packt_screen">beetle-left</span> state, and <kbd>OnStateEnter(...)</kbd> of the <strong>LocalScaleSetter</strong> script class instance to be executed, setting the local scale to <strong>(-1, 1, 1</strong>), making the <strong>Texture</strong> flip <strong>Horizontally</strong>, so the beetle faces left.</p>

<p>You may have noticed a delay, even though we set <span class="packt_screen">Exit Time</span> to <span class="packt_screen">zero</span>. This is because there is a default blending when <span class="packt_screen">Transitioning</span> from one state to another. However, this can be set to <span class="packt_screen">zero</span>, so that the state machine switches instantaneously from one state to the next.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select each <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> in the <strong>Animator</strong> panel.</li>
<li>Expand the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> properties.</li>
<li>Zero both the <span class="packt_screen">Transition Duration</span> and the <span class="packt_screen">Transition Offset</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/45bbdae8-919b-4f13-aa48-3607bac471b3.png"/></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You have added an <span class="packt_screen">Animation Controller State Machine</span> to the <span class="packt_screen">hero</span> GameObject. The two <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clips</span> you created (<span class="packt_screen">idle</span> and <span class="packt_screen">jump</span>) appear as <span class="packt_screen">States</span> in the <strong>Animator</strong> panel. You created a <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Idle</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Jump</span> when the <span class="packt_screen">JumpTrigger</span> parameter is received by the <span class="packt_screen">State Machine</span>. You created a second <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span>, which transitions back to the <span class="packt_screen">Idle</span> state after waiting 0.5 seconds (the same duration between the 2 key-frames in our <span class="packt_screen">Jump Animation Clip</span>).</p>
<p>The player makes the character<span> jump by pressing the </span><em><span class="KeyPACKT">Space</span></em><span> key. This causes</span> code in the <kbd>PlayerControl</kbd> C#-scripted component of the <span class="packt_screen">hero</span> GameObject to be invoked, that makes the sprite move upwards on screen, and also sends a <kbd>SetTrigger(...)</kbd> message to the Animator controller component, for the Trigger named Jump.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The difference between a <span class="packt_screen">Boolean Parameter</span> and a <span class="packt_screen">Trigger</span> is that a <span class="packt_screen">Trigger</span> is temporality set to <span class="packt_screen">True</span> and once the <kbd>SetTrigger(...)</kbd> event has been consumed by a state transition, it automatically returns to being <span class="packt_screen">False</span>. So <span class="packt_screen">Triggers</span> are useful for actions we wish to do once and then revert to a previous state. A <span class="packt_screen">Boolean Parameter</span> is a variable, which can have its value set to <span class="packt_screen">True</span> or <span class="packt_screen">False</span> at different times during the game, and so different <span class="packt_screen">Transitions</span> can be created to fire depending on the value of the variable at any time. Note that <span class="packt_screen">Boolean </span><span class="packt_screen">Parameters</span> have to have their values explicitly set back to <span class="packt_screen">False</span> with <kbd>SetBool(...)</kbd>.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The following screenshot highlights the line of code that sends the <kbd>SetTrigger(...)</kbd> message:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b78d2caa-e14b-4bcc-9d8d-71b1e841aa25.png" style="width:34.58em;height:11.17em;"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><span class="packt_screen">State Machines</span> for animations of a range of motions (running/walking/jumping/falling/dying) will have more <span class="packt_screen">States</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Transitions</span>. The Unity-provided potato-man <span class="packt_screen">hero</span> character has a more complex <span class="packt_screen">State Machine</span>, and more complex animations (of hands and feet, and eyes and hat, and so on, for each <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span>), which you may find useful to explore.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">To create a continually-moving animated platform, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag an instance of the <span class="packt_screen">platformWoodBlocks</span> sprite from the <span class="packt_screen">Project | Sprites</span> folder into the <strong>Scene</strong>. Position this GameObject at <span class="packt_screen">(-4, -5, 0</span>), so that these wood blocks are neatly to the left, and slightly below, the wall blocks platform.</li>
<li>Add a <span class="packt_screen">Box Collider 2D</span> component to the <span class="packt_screen">platformWoodBlocks</span> GameObject so that the player's character can stand on this platform too. Choose menu: <span class="packt_screen">Add Component | Physics 2D | Box Collider 2D</span>.</li>
<li>Create a new folder named <span class="packt_screen">Animations</span>, in which to store the <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span> and controller we'll create next.</li>
<li>Ensuring the <span class="packt_screen">platformWoodBlocks</span> GameObject is still selected in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, open an <strong>Animation</strong> panel, and ensure it is in <span class="packt_screen">Dope Sheet</span> view (this is the default).</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Animation</strong> panel's <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> button, and save the new clip in your new <span class="packt_screen">Animation</span> folder, naming it <span class="packt_screen">platform-wood-moving-up-down</span>.</li>
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Add Property</span> button, choose <span class="packt_screen">Transform</span>, and the click the plus-sign by <span class="packt_screen">Position</span>. We are now ready to record changes to the (X, Y, Z) position of the <span class="packt_screen">platformWoodBlocks</span> GameObject in this <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e77cbeb9-d991-49aa-994f-3d944fe7a227.png"/></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>You should now see 2 keyframes at 0.0 and at 1.0. These are indicated by diamonds in the <span class="packt_screen">Timeline</span> area in the right-hand section of the <strong>Animation</strong> panel.</li>
<li>We need 3 keyframes, with the new one at <kbd>2:00</kbd> seconds. Click at 2:00 in the <span class="packt_screen">Timeline</span> along the top of the <span class="packt_screen">Animation</span> panel, so that the red line for the current playhead time is at time 2:00. Then click the diamond <span class="packt_screen">+</span> button to create a new keyframe at the current playhead time:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bc5beb79-2670-47c1-9c6e-98e6c67f2320.png"/></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>The first and third keyframes are fine <span>–</span> they record the current height of the wood platform at <span class="packt_screen">Y= -5</span>. We need to make the middle keyframe record the height of the platform at the top of its motion, and Unity <span class="packt_screen">in-betweening</span> will do all the rest of the animation work for us.</li>
<li>Select the middle keyframe (at time 1:00), by clicking on the diamond at time 1:00 (they should both turn blue, and the red playhead vertical line should move to 1:00, to indicate the middle keyframe is being edited).</li>
<li>Click the red <span class="packt_screen">Record</span> cirle button to start recording changes.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong>, change the Y-position of the platform to 0. You should see that all three X, Y, and Z values have a red background in the <strong>Inspector</strong> <span>–</span> this is to inform you that the values of the <span class="packt_screen">Transform</span> component are being recorded in the <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span>.</li>
<li>Click the red <span class="packt_screen">Record</span> circle button again, to finish recording changes.</li>
<li>Save and run your <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span>. The wooden platform should now be animating continuously, moving smoothly up and down the positions we set up.</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign packt_infobox">If you want the potatoman character to be able to jump when on the moving wooden block, you'll need to select the block GameObject and set its layer to <span class="packt_screen">Ground</span>.</div>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You have added an animation to the <span class="packt_screen">platformWoodBlocks</span> GameObject. This animation contains three keyframes. A keyframe represents the values of properties of the object at a point in time. The first keyframe stores a Y-value of -4, the second keyframe a Y-value of 0, and the final keyframe -4 again. Unity calculates all the <span class="packt_screen">in-between</span> values for us, and the result is a smooth animation of the Y-position of the platform.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">If we wanted to duplicate the moving platform, simply duplicating the <span class="packt_screen">platformWoodBlocks</span> GameObject in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> and moving the copy won't work <span>–</span> since when you run the <strong>Scene</strong> each duplicate would be animated back to the location of the original animation frames (that is, all copies would be positioned and moving in the original location).</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The solution is first to create a new, empty GameObject (named <span class="packt_screen">movingBlockParent</span>), and then a <span class="packt_screen">platformWoodBlocks</span> parent to this GameObject. Now we can duplicate the <span class="packt_screen">movingBlockParent</span> GameObject (and its <span class="packt_screen">platformWoodBlocks</span> child) to create more moving blocks in our scene that each move relative to where the parent GameObject is located at <strong>Design-Time</strong>.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">In many cases, we don't want an animation to begin until some condition has been met, or some event has occurred. In these cases, a good way to organize the <span class="packt_screen">Animator Controller</span> is to have two animation states (clips) and a <span class="packt_screen">Trigger</span> on the <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> between the clips. We use code to detect when we want the animation to start playing, and at that time we send the <span class="packt_screen">Trigger</span> message to the <span class="packt_screen">Animation Controller</span>, causing the <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> to start.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">In this recipe, we'll create a water platform block in our 2D platform game; such blocks will begin to slowly fall down the screen as soon as they have been stepped on, and so the player must keep on moving otherwise they'll fall down the screen with the blocks too!

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">To construct an animation that only plays once a <span class="packt_screen">Trigger</span> has been received, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, create an Empty GameObject named <span class="packt_screen">water-block-container</span>, positioned at (2.5, -4, 0). This empty GameObject will allow us to make duplicates of animated Water Blocks that will animate relative to their parent GameObject position.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Drag an instance of the <span class="packt_screen">Water Block</span> sprite from the <span class="packt_screen">Project | Sprites</span> folder into the scene and child it to the <span class="packt_screen">water-block-container</span> GameObject. Ensure the position of your new child Water Block GameObject is (0, 0, 0), so that it appears neatly to right of the wall blocks platform:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/00271829-245c-4049-8d08-667da1aaf94e.png"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add a <span class="packt_screen">Box C</span><span class="packt_screen">ollider 2D</span> component to the child <span class="packt_screen">Water Block</span> GameObject, and set the layer of this GameObject to <span class="packt_screen">Ground</span>, so that the player's character can stand and jump on this water block platform.</li>
<li>Ensuring the child <span class="packt_screen">Water Block</span> GameObject is selected in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, open an <strong>Animation</strong> panel, then create a new clip named <span class="packt_screen">platform-water-up,</span> saving it in your <span class="packt_screen">Animations</span> folder.</li>
<li>Create a second <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span>, named <span class="packt_screen">platform-water-down</span>. Again, click the  <span class="packt_screen">Add Property</span> button, chose <span class="packt_screen">Transform</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Position</span>, and delete the second keyframe at 1:00.</li>
<li>With the first keyframe at 0:00 selected, click the red <span class="packt_screen">Record</span> button once to start recording changes, and set the Y-value of the GameObject's Transform Position to -5. Press the red <span class="packt_screen">Record</span> button again to stop recording changes. You have now completed the creation of the water-block-down <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span>, so you can click the red <span class="packt_screen">Record</span> button to stop recording.</li>
<li>You may have noticed that as well as the up/down <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clips</span> that you created, another file was created in your <span class="packt_screen">Animations</span> folder, an <span class="packt_screen">Animator Controller</span> named <span class="packt_screen">Water Block</span>. Select this file and open the <span class="packt_screen">Animator</span> panel, to see and edit the <span class="packt_screen">State Machine</span> diagram:</li>

<ol start="8">
<li>Currently, although we created 2 <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clips</span> (states), only the <span class="packt_screen">Up</span> state is ever active. This is because when the scene begins (Entry), the object will immediately go in the <span class="packt_screen">platform-water-up</span> state, but since there are no <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> arrows from this state to <span class="packt_screen">platform-water-down</span>, at present the <span class="packt_screen">Water Block</span> GameObject will always be in its <span class="packt_screen">Up</span> state.</li>
<li>Ensure the <span class="packt_screen">platform-water-up</span> state is selected (it will have a blue border around it), and create a <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> (arrow) to the <span class="packt_screen">platform-water-down</span> state by choosing <span class="packt_screen">Make Transition</span> from the mouse-right-click menu.</li>
<li>If you run the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> now, the default <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> settings are that after 0.75 seconds (default <span class="packt_screen">Exit Time</span>), the <span class="packt_screen">Water Block</span> will <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> into their <span class="packt_screen">Down</span> state. We don't want this <span>–</span> we only want them to animate downwards after the player has walked onto them.</li>
<li>Create a <span class="packt_screen">Trigger</span> named <span class="packt_screen">Fall</span>, by choosing the <span class="packt_screen">Parameters</span> tab in the <strong>Animator</strong> panel, clicking the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> button and selecting <span class="packt_screen">Trigger</span>, and then selecting <span class="packt_screen">Fall</span>.</li>
<li>Do the following to create the transition to wait for our <span class="packt_screen">Trigger</span>:
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Animator</strong> panel, select the <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span></li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel, uncheck the <span class="packt_screen">Has Exit Time</span> option</li>
<li>Set <span class="packt_screen">Transition Duration</span> to 3.0 (so the <span class="packt_screen">Water Block</span> slowly <span class="packt_screen">Transitions</span> to its <span class="packt_screen">Down</span> state over a period of 2 seconds)</li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> panel, click the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> button to add a <span class="packt_screen">Condition</span>, which should automatically suggest the only possible <span class="packt_screen">Condition Parameter</span>, which is our <span class="packt_screen">Trigger Fall</span>:</li>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You created a two-state <span class="packt_screen">Animator Controller</span> state machine. Each state was an <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span>. You created a <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Water Block Up</span> state to its <span class="packt_screen">Down</span> state that will take place when the <span class="packt_screen">Animator Controller</span> received a <span class="packt_screen">Fall Trigger</span> message. You created a <span class="packt_screen">Box Collider 2D</span> with a <span class="packt_screen">Trigger</span>, so that the scripted <span class="packt_screen">WaterBlock</span> component could be detected when the player (tagged <span class="packt_screen">Player</span>) enters its collider, and at that point send the <span class="packt_screen">Fall Trigger</span> message to make the <span class="packt_screen">Water Block</span> GameObject start gently <span class="packt_screen">Transitioning</span> into its <span class="packt_screen">Down</span> state further down the screen.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The traditional method of animation involved hand-drawing many images, each slightly different, which displayed quickly frame-by-frame to give the appearance of movement. For computer game animation, the term <span class="packt_screen">Sprite Sheet</span> is given to the image file that contains one or more sequences of sprite frames. Unity provides tools to break up individual sprite images into large <span class="packt_screen">Sprite Sheet</span> files, so that individual frames, or sub-sequences of frames, can be used to create <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clips</span> that can become <span class="packt_screen">States</span> in <span class="packt_screen">Animator Controller State Machines</span>. In this recipe, we'll import and break up an open source monster sprite sheet into three animation clips for <span class="packt_screen">Idle</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Attack</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Death</span>, which looks as shown:</p>

<li>In the scene, create a new Empty GameObject named <span class="packt_screen">monster1</span> (at position 0, 0, 0), and drag your <span class="packt_screen">monster-animator</span> into this GameObject.</li>
<li>With the <span class="packt_screen">monster1</span> GameObject selected in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, open up the <strong>Animation</strong> panel, and create a new <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span> named <span class="packt_screen">monster1-idle</span>.</li>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Unity's <span class="packt_screen">Sprite Editor</span> knows about <span class="packt_screen">Sprite Sheets</span>, and once the correct grid size has been entered, it treats the items in each grid square inside the <span class="packt_screen">Sprite Sheet</span> image as an individual image, or frame, of the animation. You selected sub-sequences of sprite animation frames and added them into several <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clips</span>. You added an <span class="packt_screen">Animation Controller</span> to your GameObject, and so each <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span> appears as a state in the <span class="packt_screen">Animation Controller State Machine</span>.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You can now repeat the process, creating an <span class="packt_screen">Animation Clip</span><span class="packt_screen">monster-attack</span> with frames 8-12, and a third clip <span class="packt_screen">monster-death</span> with frames 15-21. You would then create <span class="packt_screen">Triggers</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Transitions</span> to make the <span class="packt_screen">monster</span> GameObject transition into the appropriate states as the game is played.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">By having a set of platform <span class="packt_screen">Sprites</span> that are all a regular size (<span class="packt_screen">128 x 128</span>), it is straightforward to create a <span class="packt_screen">Tile Palette</span> from those <span class="packt_screen">Sprites</span>, and then to add a <span class="packt_screen">Grid</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Tilemap</span> to the <strong>Scene</strong>, allowing the <span class="packt_screen">Tile Palette</span> brush to paint <span class="packt_screen">Tiles</span> into the <strong>Scene</strong>.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You had to set the <span class="packt_screen">Sprite</span> pixels per unit to 128, so each <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span> maps to a 1 x 1 Unity grid unit.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You added a <span class="packt_screen">Tilemap Collider 2D</span> to the <span class="packt_screen">Tilemap</span> GameObject, so that characters (such as the potatoman) can interact with the platforms. By adding a <span class="packt_screen">Layer Ground</span>, and setting the <span class="packt_screen">Tilemap</span> GameObject to this <span class="packt_screen">Layer</span>, jumping code in the potatoman character-controller script can test the <span class="packt_screen">Layer</span> of the object being stood above, so that the jump action will only be possible when standing on a platform <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span>.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The object <span class="packt_screen">Sprites</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Desert</span> free pack are all different sizes, and certainly not consistent with the <span class="packt_screen">128 x 128</span> Sprite size for the platform Tiles.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">However, if the <span class="packt_screen">Sprites</span> for the objects and walls in your game <em>are</em> the same size as your platform <span class="packt_screen">Sprites</span>, you can create a <span class="packt_screen">Tile Palette</span> for your objects, and paint them into the <strong>Scene</strong> using the <span class="packt_screen">Tile Palette</span> brush.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">If you explore the <span class="packt_screen">2D Extras Pack</span>, or the <span class="packt_screen">2D GameKit</span> (see next recipe), you'll learn about <span class="packt_screen">Rule Tiles</span>. These allow you to define rules about the choice of a <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span> based on its neighbors. For example, you wouldn't put a platform top <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span> immediately on top of another one, so <span class="packt_screen">Rule Tiles</span> would place some kind of ground tile to be the <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span> under the platform top tile. Rules can ensure the leftmost and rightmost tiles in a group select the <span class="packt_screen">Tiles</span> with artwork for the edges, and so on.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">A good introduction to <span class="packt_screen">Rule Times</span> can be found in this Unity live training video session: <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/using-rule-tiles-tilemap">https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/using-rule-tiles-tilemap</a>.</span></p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">To create a game with the <strong>2D GameKit</strong>, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Unity 2D project.</li>
<li>Use the <span class="packt_screen">Package Manager</span> to install the <span class="packt_screen">Cinemachine</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Post Processing</span> packages (if these are installed, you'll get errors when downloading the <span class="packt_screen">2D GameKit</span>).</li>
<li>Import <span class="packt_screen">2D GameKit</span> (free from Unity Technologies) from the <span class="packt_screen">Asset Store</span>.</li>
<li>Close and then re-open the Unity Editor.</li>
<li>Create a new <span class="packt_screen">2D GameKit</span><strong>Scene</strong>, by choosing menu: <span class="packt_screen">Kit Tools | Create New Scene</span>. You'll then be asked to name the <strong>Scene</strong>, and a new <strong>Scene</strong> asset file will be created in your <span class="packt_screen">Project | Assets</span> folder. You'll see there are quite a few special GameObjects in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong> of your new <strong>Scene</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a0a8d52f-4abb-411a-8e38-e5a665a0d5de.png"/></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>As you can see, the new <strong>Scene</strong> starts off containing an animated 2D character (<span class="packt_screen">Ellen</span>), and a small platform.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong>, select the <span class="packt_screen">Tilemap</span> child of the <span class="packt_screen">TilemapGrid</span> GameObject <span>– </span> we are getting ready to paint some <span class="packt_screen">Tiles</span> onto this <span class="packt_screen">Tilemap</span> GameObject.</li>
<li>Display the <span class="packt_screen">Tile Palette</span>, choose menu: <span class="packt_screen">Window | 2D | Tile Palette</span>. Select <span class="packt_screen">TilesetGameKit</span>, and click on the green-topped grass platform <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span>. Select the <span class="packt_screen">Paint with active Brush</span> tool (the <em>paintbrush</em> icon).</li>
<li>Start painting grass-topped platforms onto the <strong>Scene</strong>. This is a <span class="packt_screen">Rule Tile</span>, so it cleverly ensures that only the top <span class="packt_screen">Tiles</span> in a touching group are painted with the grass-topped <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span>. The other touching tiles (left/right/below) are painted with a brown, earthy <span class="packt_screen">Tile</span>.</li>
<li>Create a wide, flat area, and then to the right of where <span class="packt_screen">Ellen</span> starts, create a very tall wall of earth, too tall for <span class="packt_screen">Ellen</span> to jump over.</li>
<li>Add four Spikes between <span class="packt_screen">Ellen</span> and the earth wall, so she would get hurt trying to jump over them. Drag instances of the <span class="packt_screen">Spikes Prefab</span> from  the <span class="packt_screen">2DGameKit | Prefabs | Environment</span> Project folder.</li>
<li>To make things even harder, add a <span class="packt_screen">Chomper</span> enemy between the <span class="packt_screen">Spikes</span> and the earth wall! Drag an instance of the <span class="packt_screen">Chomper</span> Prefab from the <span class="packt_screen">2DGameKit | Prefabs | Enemies</span> Project folder:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2c611415-5bd6-4620-a10d-79892271ca6c.png"/></p>
<ol start="13">
<li>We have to give <span class="packt_screen">Ellen</span> some way to get past the earth wall that avoids the <span class="packt_screen">Spikes</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Chomper</span> obstacles. Let's add a <span class="packt_screen">Teleporter</span>, to the left of where <span class="packt_screen">Ellen</span> starts. Drag an instance of the <span class="packt_screen">Teleporter</span> Prefab from the <span class="packt_screen">2DGameKit | Prefabs | Interactables</span> Project folder.</li>
<li>Let's create a destination point for the <span class="packt_screen">Teleporter</span> using a custom <span class="packt_screen">Sprite</span>. Import the <span class="packt_screen">Enemy</span><span class="packt_screen">Bug Sprite</span> into this project, and drag an instance from the <strong>Project</strong> panel into the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> <span>–</span> somewhere to the right of the earth wall.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="15">
<li><span class="packt_screen">Teleporters</span> require a <span class="packt_screen">Transition Point</span> component in the GameObject that is to be the destination of the teleportation. Add a <span class="packt_screen">Collider 2D</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Enemy Bug</span>, choose <span class="packt_screen">Add Component | Physics 2D | Box Collider 2D</span>. Check its <span class="packt_screen">Is Trigger</span> option.</li>
<li>Add a <span class="packt_screen">Transition Point</span> component to <span class="packt_screen">Enemy Bug</span>, choose <span class="packt_screen">Add Component</span>, search for <span class="packt_screen">Transition</span>, and then add <span class="packt_screen">Transition Point</span>.</li>
<li>We can now set up the <span class="packt_screen">Teleporter</span>. With the <span class="packt_screen">Teleporter</span> selected in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, in the <strong>Inspector</strong> for the <span class="packt_screen">Transition Point (Script)</span> component, do the following:
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Transitioning Game Object</span>: Drag <span class="packt_screen">Ellen</span> into this slot</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Transition Type</span>: Choose <span class="packt_screen">Same Scene</span> from the drop-down menu</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Destination Transform</span>: Drag <span class="packt_screen">Enemy Bug</span> into this <span class="packt_screen">Transition Point</span> slot</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Transition When</span>: Choose <span class="packt_screen">On Trigger Enter</span> from the drop-down menu:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e4ca9c51-468f-49e7-802a-a2fbf1e431c0.png"/></p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Run the <strong>Scene</strong>. Ellen can safetly avoid the <span class="packt_screen">Spikes</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Chomper</span> by using the <span class="packt_screen">Teleporter</span>.</li>
<li>Let's make it a bit more interesting <span>–</span> having the <span class="packt_screen">Teleporter</span> GameObject initially inactive (not visible or able to be interacted with), and adding a switch that <span class="packt_screen">Ellen</span> has to hit to make the <span class="packt_screen">Teleporter</span> active.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Teleporter</span> GameObject in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, and uncheck its active box at the top-left of the <strong>Inspector</strong> <span>–</span> the GameObject should be invisible, and appear greyed out in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="21">
<li>Add a single-use switch to the game, to the left of where <span class="packt_screen">Ellen</span> starts. Drag an instance of the <span class="packt_screen">Single Use Switch</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">2DGameKit | Prefabs | Interactables</span> Project folder.</li>
<li>With the <span class="packt_screen">Single Use Switch</span> selected in the <strong>Hierarchy</strong>, in the <strong>Inspector</strong> set the following:
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Layers:</span> Add <span class="packt_screen">Layer Player</span> to the <span class="packt_screen">Interactable Layers</span> (so the switch can be enabled by the Player colliding or firing a bullet)</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">On Enter:</span> Drag <span class="packt_screen">Teleporter</span> into a free <span class="packt_screen">RunTime Only</span> GameObject Slot, and change the action drop-down menu from <span class="packt_screen">No Function</span> to <span class="packt_screen">GameObject | Set Active (bool)</span>, and then <span class="packt_screen">check</span> the checkbox that appears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run the <strong>Scene</strong>. <span class="packt_screen">Ellen</span> now has to travel over to the switch, to reveal the <span class="packt_screen">Teleporter</span>, which then leads her to safely transport to the <span class="packt_screen">Enemy Bug</span> location, beyond the earth wall and away from danger.</li>
</ol>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">We have dipped our toes into the wide range of features of the 2D GameKit. Hopefully this recipe gives you an idea of how to work with the provided Prefabs, and also how to explore how custom artwork can be used, with appropriately-added components to create your own GameObjects using the features of the 2D GameKit.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">If you look at the Ellen 2D character, you'll see some scripted components that manage the character's interaction with the 2D GameKit. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">CharacterController 2D</span>: Movement and physics interactions</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Player Input</span>: Keyboard/input control mapping, so you can change which keys/controller buttons control movement, jumping, and so on</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Player Character</span>: How characters interact with the <span class="packt_screen">2D GameKit</span>, including fighting (melee), damage, and bullet pool</li>
