- en: I can vividly remember the trepidation I felt about telling my parents that
    I was going to study game development. At that time, in my region, this ambition
    was dismissed as juvenile and lacking in future prospects. However, my tenacity
    and determination led me to chase this dream relentlessly. Today, the game industry
    has grown exponentially, surpassing even the film industry in revenue.

    with the same dream as me sooner or later realizes the complexity and depth of
    knowledge required in this field. Sadly, this steep learning curve leads many
    to give up, but I strongly believe that with the proper guidance and tools, you
    can make your career path easier. For me, mastering Unity was pivotal in streamlining
    my learning process. And this book is a culmination of that experience, aimed
    at easing your journey into the world of game development.

    latest Unity features so that you can create your first video game in the simplest
    way possible. Unity offers an array of user-friendly yet powerful tools to address
    common game development challenges, such as rendering, animation, physics, sound,
    and effects. We will utilize all these features to create a simple but complete
    game, delving into all the intricacies of Unity.

- en: By the end of this book, you will have all the skills necessary to use Unity
    effectively, allowing you to explore in depth various areas of game development
    that interest you, whether for building a professional career or simply for the
    joy of creating games as a hobby. Unity is a versatile tool for both professional
    and amateur projects, and it is being used every day by more and more people.

    kinds of interactive applications, from straightforward mobile apps to complex
    educational and training programs, often referred to as Serious Gaming. These
    applications harness cutting-edge technologies like Augmented and Virtual Reality.
    Therefore, while our primary focus here is game development, you are embarking
    on a learning journey that offers a spectrum of potential specializations.

    If you have a basic understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming** (**OOP**)
    but are new to game development or have never used Unity, you’ll find this book
    a good introduction to both game development and Unity’s fundamental to advanced
    concepts. Even seasoned Unity developers looking to master the platform’s latest
    features will discover valuable insights in many sections of this book.

- en: On the other hand, if you’re starting without any programming experience, this
    book is still highly accessible. Many chapters have been designed to be informative
    without requiring prior coding knowledge. These sections will equip you with a
    solid foundation for starting to learn how to code in Unity, making the learning
    curve much smoother than it would be otherwise. Once you’ve grasped the basics
    of coding, the scripting-focused chapters of this book will become increasingly
    beneficial. Additionally, with the introduction of Visual Scripting in Unity,
    those who prefer node-based scripting have an appealing alternative available.

    while you can just read the chapters, I highly recommend you practice all the
    steps in this project as you advance through the book so you can get the experience
    needed to properly learn the concepts demonstrated here. The chapters have been
    designed so you can customize the game and not create the exact game shown in
    the book. However, I recommend not deviating too much from the main idea.

    or the changed ones. This means, for example, that if a file hasn’t changed since
    *Chapter 1*, you won’t find it in *Chapter 2* onward; those chapters will just
    use the file introduced in *Chapter 1*. This allows you to see just what we changed
    in each chapter, easily identifying the needed changes, and if for some reason
    you can’t finish, for example, *Chapter 3*, you can just continue with *Chapter
    4*’s steps on top of *Chapter 3*. Also note that *Chapters 15* to *19* will have
