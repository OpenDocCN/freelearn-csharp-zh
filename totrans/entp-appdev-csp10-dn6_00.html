			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>.NET 6 is an open source, free, and full stack framework to write applications targeting any platform. The framework offers you the opportunity to write applications with ease, including for the cloud. As software developers, we are entrusted with the responsibility of building complex enterprise applications. In this book, we will learn about various advanced architectures and concepts for building enterprise applications using C# 10 and .NET 6.</p>
			<p>This book can be used as a reference while building an enterprise application using .NET 6. Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts, practical examples, and self-assessment questions, you will get in-depth coverage of and exposure to every important component of .NET 6 required to build a professional enterprise application.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Conventions used</h1>
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Code in text</strong>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "<strong class="source-inline">WriteMinimalPlainText</strong> will just emit the overall status of the health check services."</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">{</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">   endpoints.MapControllerRoute(</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">        name: "default",</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">        pattern: "{controller=Products}/{action=Index}/{id?}");</pre>
			<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">{</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">        "{controller=Products}/{action=Index}/{id?}");</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    <strong class="bold">endpoints.MapHealthChecks("/health");</strong></pre>
			<pre class="source-code">});</pre>
			<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">dotnet new classlib -o MyLibrary</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: "Let's <a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>add a custom event tracking when the user <a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>clicks on the <strong class="bold">Add to Cart</strong> button on the <strong class="bold">Product Details</strong> page."</p>
