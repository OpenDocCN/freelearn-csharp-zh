<p class="mce-root">In <a href="f4fba83f-4f23-4537-a130-ed8dab8f3815.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Downloading and Installing Unity</em>, <span>we explored game engines and took a quick look at four alternative game engines to help us appreciate Unity. We looked at the history of Unity and how it evolved from one release to the next. In addition, we discovered Unity's key capabilities and features. We covered Unity's system requirements for developing Unity games and the system requirements for running them. Finally, we downloaded and installed Unity.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will examine Unity's primary views and windows; we will also cover layouts and the toolbar. The interface components covered in this chapter are the ones used most often. Additional interface components will be covered in subsequent chapters as new functionality and tools are introduced.</p>
<p>Specifically, we will cover the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen Real Estate </li>
<li>Menu</li>
<li>Scene view</li>
<li>Game view</li>
<li>Project window</li>
<li>Hierarchy window</li>
<li>Inspector window</li>
<li>Toolbar</li>
<li>Layouts</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">Unity can be run on Windows PCs and Macs. The screen images used in this chapter and throughout the book are from Unity running on a Mac. There might be slight interface differences between the screenshots provided and you see when Unity is running on a Windows PC.</div>

<p>When we first launch Unity, we might be intimidated by all the areas, tabs, menus, and buttons on the interface. Unity is a complex game engine with a lot of functionality, so we should expect more components for us to interact with. If we break the interface down into separate components, we can examine each one independently to gain a thorough understanding of the entire interface.</p>
<p>As you can see here, we have identified six primary areas of the interface. We will examine each of these in subsequent sections. As you will quickly learn, this interface is customizable. The following screenshot shows the default configuration of the Unity user interface.</p>

<p>The Unity editor's main menu bar, as depicted here, consists of eight pull-down options. We will briefly review each menu option in this section. Additional details will be provided in subsequent chapters, as we start developing our <em>Cucumber Beetle</em> game:</p>

<p><span>Unity's menus are contextual. This means that only menu items pertinent to the currently selected object will be enabled. Other non-applicable menu items will appear as gray instead of black and not be selectable.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Starting with Unity 2018, an additional top menu is <span class="packt_screen">Mobile Input</span>. This menu item allows you to toggle mobile input on and off.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Unity</span> menu item, shown here, gives us access to information about Unity, our software license, display options, module information, and access to preferences:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="206" width="141" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-499 image-border" src="assets/168b0480-d54a-4b04-90e8-bf2924b8b44c.png"/></div>
<p>Accessing the <span class="packt_screen">Unity</span> | <span class="packt_screen">About Unity...</span> menu option gives you access to the version of the engine you are running. There is additional information as well, but you would probably only use this menu option to check your Unity version.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Unity</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Preferences...</span> option brings up the Unity Preferences dialog window. That interface has seven side tabs: <span class="packt_screen">General</span>, <span class="packt_screen">External Tools</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Colors</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Keys</span>, <span class="packt_screen">GI Cache</span>, <span class="packt_screen">2D</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Cache Server</span>. You are encouraged to become familiar with them as you gain experience in Unity. We will use the <span class="packt_screen">External Tools</span> tab in <a href="e8407796-3bbd-4f54-bbcc-e1bd89284de5.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Optimizing Our Game for Deployment</em>.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Unity</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Modules</span> option provides you with a list of playback engines that are running as well as any Unity extensions. </p>
<p>You can quit the Unity game engine by selecting the <span class="packt_screen">Unity</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Quit</span> menu option.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">In Unity 2018, the <span class="packt_screen">Unity</span> menu item is not present. The functionality will be moved to the <span class="packt_screen">Help</span> menu.</div>

<p>Unity's <span class="packt_screen">File</span> menu includes access to your game's scenes and projects. We will use these features throughout our game development process. As you can see in the following screenshot, we also have access to the <span class="packt_screen">Build Settings...</span>. We will explore this functionality in <a href="e8407796-3bbd-4f54-bbcc-e1bd89284de5.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Optimizing Our Game for Deployment</em>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> menu has similar functionality to standard editors, not just game engines. For example, the standard <span class="packt_screen">Cut</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Copy</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Paste</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Delete</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Undo</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Redo</span> options are there. Moreover, the short keys are aligned with the software industry standard. </p>
<p>As you can see from the following screenshot, there is additional functionality accessible here. There are <span class="packt_screen">play</span>, <span class="packt_screen">pause</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">step</span> commands. We can also sign in and out of our Unity account: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="435" width="172" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-501 image-border" src="assets/5dc7e792-aba4-4318-bd56-69871e5bdf9f.png"/></div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Project Settings</span> option gives us access to <span class="packt_screen">Input</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Tags and Layers</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Audio</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Time</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Player</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Physics</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Physics 2D</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Quality</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Graphics</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Network</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Editor</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Script Execution Order</span>. In most cases, selecting one of these options opens or focuses keyboard control to the specific functionality.</p>

<p>We will use the <span class="packt_screen">Assets</span> menu functions extensively throughout this book, starting with <a href="f9370800-eaf9-4593-8a9c-8252c85e22ac.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Creating Our Terrain</em>. Assets are representations of things that we can use in our game. Examples include audio files, art files, and 3D models. There are several types of assets that can be used in Unity. As you can see from the following screenshot, we are able to create, import, and export assets:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="333" width="186" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-502 image-border" src="assets/a8da538b-45f7-4f40-b968-cb5b24a3c7db.png"/></div>
<p>You will become increasingly familiar with this collection of functionality as you progress through the book and start developing your game.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">GameObject</span> menu provides us with the ability to create and manipulate GameObjects. In Unity, GameObjects are things we use in our game such as lights, cameras, 3D objects, trees, characters, cars, and so much more. As you can see here, we can create an empty <span class="packt_screen">GameObject</span> as well as an empty child <span class="packt_screen">GameObject</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="363" width="168" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-503 image-border" src="assets/f6c45608-b43b-4fdb-b788-a91bfb5a5bcd.png"/></div>
<p>We will have extensive hands-on dealings with the <span class="packt_screen">GameObject</span> menu items throughout this book. At this point, it is important that you know this is where you go to create GameObjects as well as perform some manipulations on them.</p>

<p>In the last section, we mentioned that GameObjects <span>are just <em>things</em>. They actually only become meaningful when we add components to them. Components are an important concept in Unity, and we will be working with them a lot as we progress with our game's development. It is the components that implement functionality for our</span> GameObjects. </p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the various categories of components. This is one method for creating components in Unity:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="321" width="157" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-504 image-border" src="assets/34e22736-9068-40b2-a77d-4b656182c6db.png"/></div>

            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Window</span> menu option provides access to a lot of extra features. As you can see here, there is a <span class="packt_screen">Minimize</span> option that will minimize the main Unity editor window. The <span class="packt_screen">Zoom</span> option toggles full screen and zoomed view:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="466" width="136" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-505 image-border" src="assets/1a2e98e4-1d9d-46c7-939f-808da856c685.png"/></div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Layouts</span> option provides access to various editor layouts, to save or delete a layout. Layouts will be covered in greater depth later in this chapter. </p>
<p>The following table provides a brief description for the remaining options available via the <span class="packt_screen">Window</span> menu item. You will gain hands-on experience with these windows as you progress through this book:</p>

<p>Referring to the first screenshot in this chapter, the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view is typically in the center of the Unity editor and might be tabled alongside the <span class="packt_screen">Game</span> view tab. </p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view is where you will spend most of your time working on your game. You will build and manipulate your game levels here. Some of the actions you will take in this view are adding and modifying game characters, lights, cameras, and other objects related to your game. </p>
<p>As shown in the following screenshot, the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view has a set of controls lining the top of the interface. This is referred to as the control bar:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/38a1bf87-694e-4e1e-b870-bc5132eca3f2.png"/></div>

            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> window is one that you will use frequently and provides quick access to objects in your project. As you can see here, the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> window is organized in a hierarchical view on the left. Selecting a folder on the left reveals the contents in the panel on the right.</p>
<p>That panel displays breadcrumbs on top and has a slider in the bottom-right corner to control the size of the icons:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="348" width="610" src="assets/6350c0fc-e205-4b50-8312-864053a53516.png"/></div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> drop-down menu in the top-left section of the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> window gives you quick access to creating a game asset in the current folder.</p>
<p>To the right of the <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> drop-down menu is a search bar followed by three icons. The first two icons are Search by Type and Search by Label, respectively. The third icon allows you to save your search.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The contents of the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> window provided in this section are representative and not part of this book's game.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> window lists all GameObjects in the current scene. This is different than what is displayed in the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> window because a game project contains one or more scenes, and not every object in a project is in a scene. As you can see in the following screenshot, some items in the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> window have a triangle on the left. Clicking a triangle will expand the contents, showing child objects. Parenting, or subordinating GameObjects with one another, is important and something that you will gain exposure to as you start adding GameObjects to your game:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="280" width="185" src="assets/0d9f744a-fe1f-4120-b021-e4738dfa1070.png"/></div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> drop-down menu in the top-left section of the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> window gives you quick access to creating game assets.</p>
<p>To the right of the <span class="packt_screen">Create</span> drop-down menu is a search bar. Below the search bar and to the right is a menu icon. Clicking that icon reveals the following list of options:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="224" width="147" src="assets/63b6556b-ac3c-4100-9b0f-c8306df31681.png"/></div>
<p>As you can see from the menu above, it is contextual so not all items will be enabled all the time.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> window is where we can inspect our GameObjects. You will remember that GameObjects are composed of more than one component, and those components are what make the GameObjects worth having in our games. </p>
<p>This example screenshot shows a <span class="packt_screen">ThirdPersonController</span> GameObject with 11 components. The gray triangles to the left of each component allow you to expand the component and make any desired changes to that component's properties:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="313" width="296" src="assets/bde93bc4-8d8f-4b46-a0a3-ca7736826e67.png"/></div>
<p>When you select a GameObject in <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view, the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> window, or the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> window, the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> window will display the selected GameObject's components and properties. Each component has a different set of properties.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> window, when a GameObject has been selected, you will see the <span class="packt_screen">Add Component</span> button. Clicking this button allows you to add a component to the current GameObject. </p>

<p>Unity's toolbar, depicted here, is located at the very top of the editor's interface. It spans the entire width of the window, and spacing is dependent on the current width.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1ba8eb49-630d-40ce-a480-c93f2f16e647.png"/></div>
<p>The toolbar can be, theoretically, organized into the following categories: <span class="packt_screen">Transform Tools</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Gizmo Toggles</span>, Play Buttons, Cloud and <span class="packt_screen">Account</span> Buttons, and <span class="packt_screen">Layers</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Layouts</span>. We covered the Play Buttons in the <em>Game view</em> section; the remaining toolbar categories are detailed as follows.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Transform tools</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The transform tools are a set of five fundamental tools for manipulating GameObjects in the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view. Each tool is represented by an icon:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="28" width="158" src="assets/84043c14-d888-41ad-9869-805a62586cb9.png"/></div>
<p>The first button is the Hand tool or View tool. When this tool is selected, our cursor in the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view turns to a hand. This lets us know which mode we are in. With this tool selected, we can scroll with our mouse to zoom in and out of the scene. If you click on the left mouse button, you are able to pan around the scene. With the right mouse button clicked, you are able to look around, based on the current position of your cursor.</p>
<p>If you hold down the <em>Alt</em> key on a PC or <em>Option</em> key on a Mac and click on the left mouse button, you can orbit around the current area. Pressing that same key and the right mouse button allows you to zoom in and out of the scene.</p>
<p>The second button is the Translate tool and is in the shape of a quad arrow. When an object is selected, click on the translate tool; the object will have three gizmos, one for each axis. Clicking and dragging any of these gizmos moves the object along the respective axes, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f17d59f7-f03e-4484-b5e9-eeb0c8ca7f5a.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Cube with Transform Translate Tool </div>
<p>The third transform tool is the Rotate tool, which looks like two rotating arrows. This tool allows us to rotate an object along any axis (<kbd>x</kbd>, <kbd>y</kbd>, or <kbd>z</kbd>). Instead of line and arrow gizmos, this tool is instantiated with three colored rings, one for each axis. Clicking a ring and dragging it rotates the object along that axis, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="251" width="248" src="assets/8a0ee47c-7828-40c6-9509-387d599772e8.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Cube with Transform Rotate Tool </div>
<p>The fourth transform tool is the Scale tool, which is represented with line and block gizmos. Like the other transform tools, there is one gizmo for each axis. Clicking and dragging one of these gizmos increases or decreases the object along the selected axis. For example, you can make a cube wider, narrower, taller, or shorter. If you want to maintain aspect ratio, you can click on the center square instead of the red, blue, or green square. Now, when you click and drag, your object will grow or shrink in perfect aspect ratio, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="215" width="245" src="assets/079074a0-37db-436b-b328-4f3c58f975c5.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Cube with Transform Scale Tool </div>
<p>The final transform tool is the Rect tool and is represented by a rectangle with intersecting points. The Rect tool can be used to move, resize, and rotate an object in the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view. So, this is a versatile tool that also has corresponding properties that you can edit directly using the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> view. Take a look at the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="215" width="230" src="assets/d125d85d-ff51-41e8-81fb-a148b2d7f43b.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Cube with Transform Rect Tool </div>
<div class="packt_infobox">Unity 2018 will introduce a sixth transform tool that will permit the moving, rotating, and scaling of selected objects.</div>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Toolbar: Collab, Cloud and Action buttons</div>
<p>The first button is the <span class="packt_screen">Collab</span>, or Collaboration, button. <span>If you are using an integrated collaboration tool, you can access the history of changes to your project here.</span></p>
<p>The second button is the <span class="packt_screen">Cloud</span> button. This simply opens the Unity services window.</p>
<p>The third button is the <span class="packt_screen">Account</span> button. This is a drop-down button that allows you to access your Unity account. </p>

            <article>
                
<p>The final section of buttons on the toolbar consists of the <span class="packt_screen">Layers</span> drop-down and the <span class="packt_screen">Layout</span> drop-down buttons. These buttons are illustrated beneath and are located in the far-right end of the toolbar:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="29" width="171" src="assets/8b5bebfa-79c5-4b6a-be01-4ce719eda332.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Toolbar: Layers and Layout Dropdown Buttons</div>
<p>Selecting the <span class="packt_screen">Layers</span> drop-down button allows you to select what layers you want to view, not view, and which ones you want to lock. Also, as you can see here, you have access to edit layers:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="141" width="165" src="assets/9d6053d4-ab9e-4f88-be22-00f39c9cfdd7.png"/></div>
<p>Editing layers consists of creating user-defined layers that you can reorder and rename.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Layout</span> drop-down reveals the set of options:</p>

<p>One of the wonderful things about working with Unity is that you can customize the way the user interface is laid out. You can use one of the predefined layouts of <span class="packt_screen">2 by 3</span>, <span class="packt_screen">4 Split</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Tall</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Wide</span>, or you can create your own. Layouts refer to how the various views in Unity are arranged on the screen. </p>
<p>To change a layout, we simply click on the <span class="packt_screen">Layout</span> button that is located in the far top-right corner of the Unity interface. Let's look at each layout to see the differences.</p>
<p>The first layout is the <span class="packt_screen">2 by 3</span> layout. This layout provides a nice arrangement with the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Game</span> views on the left, the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> views in the middle and a full <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> view on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5389e212-af40-475d-9022-a6a72e335ba2.png"/></div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">4 Split</span> layout provides four different views of the same scene, as shown in the following screenshot. This is a good way to review how lighting and shading is implemented in your game. We'll talk about lighting and shading later in the book. The <span class="packt_screen">4 Split</span> layout is shown here:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2d2af0b1-4075-4b1a-bd0b-052f638b8a3b.png"/></div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Tall</span> layout provides a tall, but not wide, view of the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view with other views located on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6aae8bc9-0da5-4dad-84ea-1241a22b163e.png"/></div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Wide</span> layout provides a wide view of the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> view, with other views located on the bottom and on the right, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2cb01417-b22f-420e-bc86-f1aec1c37c79.png"/></div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Default</span> layout is a variation of the <span class="packt_screen">Wide</span> layout. The difference is that with the <span class="packt_screen">Default</span> layout, the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> view is on the left, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e102d877-4043-4bb9-b880-836edbb9184c.png"/></div>
<p>You can switch between layouts any time you want, without it impacting your game. Most Unity developers do not work in just one layout. Different layouts provide different benefits and are appropriate for different tasks. You can also modify any layout by dragging any of the borders of a view or window. If you want to save a layout, make any changes to the current layout, then select the <span class="packt_screen">Layout</span> button and select <span class="packt_screen">Save Layout</span>. You will be prompted for a name.</p>

<p><span>In this chapter, we examined the primary components of the Unity user interface. This included the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Game</span> views. We also looked at the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> windows. We then reviewed the various layouts as well as the toolbar. Lastly, we established that additional interface components will be covered in subsequent chapters as new functionality and tools are introduced.</span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will start designing our <em>3D Cucumber Beetle</em> game. This design will inform our development of the game throughout the rest of the book. </p>
