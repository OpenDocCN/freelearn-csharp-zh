- en: Congratulations on reaching the end of our journey into the world of functional
    programming in C#! Throughout this book, we’ve explored many concepts and techniques
    that are key to functional programming. Let’s review what we’ve learned and see
    what’s next for you as a functional programmer.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We started with the basics — expressions, statements, and understanding what
    makes a function “pure.” We learned how to write clear, easy-to-read code without
    side effects.

- en: Next, we looked at handling errors in a functional way. We saw how using types
    such as `Result` and methods such as Railway Oriented Programming can help us
    write strong, error-resistant code without using exceptions.

- en: We then moved on to higher-order functions and delegates. These tools let us
    treat functions as first-class citizens, which helps us write more abstract and
    reusable code.

- en: We also covered functors and monads, breaking down these complex ideas to show
    how they can help manage complexity in our programs.

- en: Recursion and tail calls were another important topic. We learned how to think
    about problems in a recursive way and how to optimize these recursive functions.

- en: Currying and partial application taught us how to make more specialized functions
    from general ones, improving reusability and composition.

- en: Finally, we put everything together with pipelines and function composition,
    learning how to chain functions to create clear, concise, and maintainable code.

    programming is not just a set of techniques but a way of thinking that emphasizes
    clarity, safety, and modularity.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While C# has made great strides in supporting functional programming, it’s helpful
    to compare it to languages designed specifically for this style.

- en: F#, part of the .NET family, offers a more natural functional experience with
    features such as immutable data structures, pattern matching, and computation
    expressions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Haskell, a pure functional language, treats everything as an expression and
    ensures that functions are pure by default. It manages side effects strictly through
    monads, which can make it harder to learn, but it provides strong guarantees about
    code behavior.

- en: Scala, like C#, blends object-oriented and functional programming. It has a
    more advanced type system, allowing for more abstract and general code, though
    this can add complexity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: C# stands out for its practicality. It lets you mix functional and object-oriented
    styles as needed, taking advantage of both approaches. While it may not be as
    purely functional as Haskell or as advanced in its type system as Scala, it offers
    a gentle introduction to functional programming within a familiar context.

- en: Usually, the functional way of a developer starts with C#, transitions to F#,
    and ends with pure functional Haskell. After finishing this book, you may assume
    the first step into functional programming is done, and there are many new things
    to learn.

- en: Functional programming changes how we think about and write code. By using concepts
    such as pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions, we can create
    software that is more reliable, expressive, and scalable. Thank you for having
    this journey and may functional programming be with you!
