    between BizTalk Services v1.0 and BizTalk Server. This is to be expected, as BizTalk
    Server is an established, mature product that was first shipped in 2000; it has
    received numerous updates over time. BizTalk Services, on the other hand, was
    GA'd (released for general availability) on November 21, 2013\. However, all is
    certainly not lost, as there are several ways to mitigate the effort of moving
    from one to the other. In the following sections, we'll look at the different
    types of artifacts in a BizTalk Server solution and how to migrate to BizTalk
    Services.

    Services transform.

    some rework to the resultant transforms.

    duplicate ID will need to be changed. An example is shown in the following code
    where the contents of the `Value` tag contain a duplicate ID. Changing this to
    a unique value, for example, `14`, will fix this in the sample accompanying this

    are. Just as in BizTalk Server it was perfectly possible to do everything in a
    single stage (depending on which stage it is of course), so is the case with BizTalk
    Services. While BizTalk Services doesn't have the concept of pipeline components,
    it provides enough stage placeholders for your own code and, of course, provides
    many of the things out of the box for which you'd have traditionally written a
    custom pipeline component anyway, such as property promotion. Even though BizTalk
    Server provides four receive pipeline stages, and in fact, pipeline stages are
    actually configurable (you can define your own), no one really has ever bothered
    with that and nearly all solutions just use the decode and validate stages (if
    that). The send pipeline is even less important, but again, BizTalk Services provides
    a similar mirror image of stages in which you are able to perform work with the
    messages flowing through should you need to.

    the Service Bus relay to pass messages to an Internet Information Services (IIS)-hosted
    Line of Business (LOB) adapter (actually, the same LOB adapters BizTalk ships
    with). Therefore, if the adapters your BizTalk Server solution needs are represented
    in the BizTalk Services set, the conversion is straightforward. However, there
    are hundreds of adapters available for BizTalk Server and a dozen or so for BizTalk
    Services, so clearly, there are some gaps. Some just won''t make sense for a cloud-hosted
    platform (for example, the much-loved File adapter), but for others, this could
    present a problem.'

    for example, in a bridge or transform. Of course, this is trivializing the problem
    slightly as BRE rules can access databases and other resources, so it may involve
    significantly more work than simple conversion. However, it is an option depending

    zero-effort way to convert or migrate orchestrations to BizTalk Services. There
    are some options though.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    help fill the gap. It means that orchestrations can be recoded to workflows and
    keep a similar architecture.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, remember that a bridge is actually a workflow. This means that bridges
    already offer some capabilities that orchestrations may have been used for earlier,
    such as message enrichment and routing (which is a large percentage), and as such,
    it may already be possible to migrate orchestration-based solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the intervening period though, an alternative solution may have to be found.
    One solution is to use a workflow hosted in Azure, for example, in a worker role
    cloud service. BizTalk Services could invoke the cloud service by passing a message
    or data, and the service would run the workflow and return the results. This does
    change the architecture somewhat though as typically, the orchestration is in
    control—it may wait for a set interval or for specific responses from other systems
    and typically, an orchestration is used as the driver for a business process.
    It is worth remembering that bridges can be chained, so this style of process
    definition can be mimicked with BizTalk Services, where messages are processed,
    decisions are taken on routing (to more bridges), and so on. However, such a solution
    is likely to become complex and is best avoided.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is perhaps unfortunate then that an overuse of orchestration in BizTalk Server
    has always been prevalent. Orchestration was seen as the "aha" moment in early
    BizTalk when acronyms such as Business Process Management (BPM) were in vogue.
    It's unfortunate because orchestration has often been used when it is not necessary,
    and a simpler solution could have been created without it. While education over
    time has helped somewhat, there is still a large body of complex orchestration-centric
    BizTalk Server applications. If we face this scenario, migration to BizTalk Services
    today will be challenging.

- en: In this chapter, we've looked at strategies and approaches for moving from BizTalk
    Server to BizTalk Services and some of the features that will be added to BizTalk
    Services that will make this easier. We tried to cover all the main building blocks
    of the BizTalk Server architecture and their equivalents (or alternatives) in
    BizTalk Services. As you've seen, while there is a significant overlap of functionality,
    it will take time for the BizTalk Services feature set to mature to the same level.
    The future for BizTalk Services is bright, and a fundamental tenet of Microsoft's
    cloud-first vision is to deliver frequent updates and enhancements in a way that
    simply isn't possible with shrink-wrapped on-premises products. Therefore, one
    can expect Microsoft to become even more customer focused and be able to action
    feedback and feature requests quicker than previously possible, all of which will
    enable Microsoft to help you move your existing solutions to the cloud.
