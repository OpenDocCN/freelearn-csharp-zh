- en: Unity is one of the most popular game engines in the world, catering to hobbyists,
    professional AAA studios, and cinematic production companies. While known for
    its use as a 3D tool, Unity has a host of dedicated features supporting everything
    from 2D games and virtual reality to post-production and cross-platform publishing.

- en: Developers love its drag-and-drop interface and built-in features, but it's
    the ability to write custom C# scripts for behaviors and game mechanics that really
    takes Unity the extra mile. Learning to write C# code might not be a huge obstacle
    to a seasoned programmer with other languages under their belt, but it can be
    daunting for those of you who have no programming experience. That's where this
    book comes in, as I'll be taking you through the building blocks of programming
    and the C# language from scratch while building a fun and playable game prototype
    in Unity.

- en: This book was written for those of you who don't have any experience with the
    basic tenets of programming or C#. However, if you're a competent novice or seasoned
    professional coming from another language, or even C#, but need to get hands-on
    with game development in Unity, this is still where you want to be.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Getting to Know Your Environment*, starts off with the Unity
    installation process, the main features of the editor, and finding documentation
    for C# and Unity-specific topics. We''ll also go through creating C# scripts from
    inside Unity and take a look at Visual Studio, the application where all our code
    editing takes place.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *The Building Blocks of Programming*, begins by laying out the
    atomic-level concepts of programming, giving you the chance to relate variables,
    methods, and classes to situations in everyday life. From there, we move on to
    simple debugging techniques, proper formatting and commenting, and how Unity turns
    C# scripts into components.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Diving into Variables, Types, and Methods*, takes a deeper look
    at the building blocks from *Chapter 2*. This includes C# data types, naming conventions,
    access modifiers, and everything else you''ll need for the foundation of a program.
    We''ll also go over how to write methods, add parameters, and use return types,
    ending with an overview of standard Unity methods belonging to the `MonoBehaviour`
    class.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Control Flow and Collection Types*, introduces the common approaches
    to making decisions in code, consisting of the `if-else` and `switch` statements.
    From there, we move on to working with arrays, lists, and dictionaries, and incorporating
    iteration statements for looping through collection types. We end the chapter
    with a look at conditional looping statements and a special C# data type called
    enumerations.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Working with Classes, Structs, and OOP*, details our first contact
    with constructing and instantiating classes and structs. We''ll go through the
    basic steps of creating constructors, adding variables and methods, and the fundamentals
    of subclassing and inheritance. The chapter will end with a comprehensive explanation
    of object-oriented programming and how it applies to C#.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Getting Your Hands Dirty with Unity*, marks our departure from
    C# syntax into the world of game design, level building, and Unity''s featured
    tools. We''ll start by going over the basics of a game design document and then
    move on to blocking out our level geometry and adding lighting and a simple particle
    system.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Movement, Camera Controls, and Collisions*, explains different
    approaches to moving a player object and setting up a third-person camera. We''ll
    discuss incorporating Unity physics for more realistic locomotion effects, as
    well as how to work with collider components and capture interactions within a
    scene.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Scripting Game Mechanics*, introduces the concept of game mechanics
    and how to effectively implement them. We''ll start by adding a simple jump action,
    create a shooting mechanic, and build on the previous chapters'' code by adding
    logic to handle item collection.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Basic AI and Enemy Behavior*, starts with a brief overview of
    artificial intelligence in games and the concepts we will be applying to Hero
    Born. Topics covered in this chapter will include navigation in Unity, using the
    level geometry and a navigation mesh, smart agents, and automated enemy movement.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 10*, *Revisiting Types, Methods, and Classes*, takes a more in-depth
    look at data types, intermediate method features, and additional behaviors that
    can be used for more complex classes. This chapter will give you a deeper understanding
    of the versatility and breadth of the C# language.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 11*, *Introducing Stacks, Queues, and HashSets*, dives into intermediate
    collection types and their features. Topics covered in this chapter include using
    Stacks, Queues, and HashSets and the different development scenarios that each
    is uniquely suited for.'

- en: '*Chapter 12*, *Saving, Loading, and Serializing Data*, gets you ready to handle
    your games information. Topics covered in this chapter include working with the
    filesystem and creating, deleting, and updating files. We''ll also cover different
    data types including XML, JSON, and binary data, and end with a practical discussion
    on serializing C# objects directly into data formats.'

- en: '*Chapter 13*, *Exploring Generics, Delegates, and Beyond*, details intermediate
    features of the C# language and how to apply them in practical, real-world scenarios.
    We''ll start with an overview of generic programming and progress to concepts
    such as delegation, events, and exception handling.'

    throughout the book and leaves you with resources for further study in both C#
    and Unity. Included in these resources will be online reading material, certification
    information, and a host of my favorite video tutorial channels.'

- en: The only thing you need to get the most from your upcoming C# and Unity adventure
    is a curious mind and a willingness to learn. Having said that, doing all the
    code exercises, Hero's trials, and Quiz sections is a must if you hope to cement
    the knowledge you're learning. Lastly, revisiting topics and entire chapters to
    refresh or solidify your understanding before moving on is always a good idea.
    There is no sense in building a house on an unstable foundation.
