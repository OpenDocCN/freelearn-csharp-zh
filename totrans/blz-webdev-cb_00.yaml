- en: '**Blazor** is a powerful web framework introduced by Microsoft that allows
    developers to build interactive and modern web applications using **C#** and **.NET**
    instead of relying on JavaScript. Blazor bridges the gap between front-end and
    back-end development, offering a unified programming model that makes it easier
    to create full-featured web applications with a consistent and robust language
    stack. With Blazor, you can choose to host your application statically on the
    server; have a server-side interactivity through **SignalR** ; build a client-side
    interface running directly in the browser, using **WebAssembly** ; or mix all
    approaches however you see fit.'

- en: While you can easily find resources introducing Blazor basics and fundamental
    concepts, this book takes you deeper into advanced techniques and best practices
    for building enterprise-grade Blazor applications. The goal is to equip you with
    the tools to build robust, secure, scalable, and maintainable solutions. We will
    focus on practical, real-world examples and walk through the recipes you need
    to tackle the most common development challenges, leveraging the powerful features
    that Blazor offers.
