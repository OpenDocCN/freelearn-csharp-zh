			<p>Welcome to <em class="italic">Functional Programming </em><em class="italic">with C#</em>!</p>
			<p>This book is designed to introduce you to the powerful paradigm of functional programming within the context of C#. As C# continues to evolve, it increasingly embraces functional programming concepts, allowing developers to write more concise, maintainable, and robust code. This book will guide you through the journey of understanding and applying functional programming principles in C#, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.</p>

			<p>To follow along with the examples in this book, you’ll need to have the .NET 8 SDK installed on your machine. Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code with the C# extension are recommended for the best development experience. All code samples in the book are compatible with C# 12 and .NET 8, but most will work with earlier versions as well.</p>

			<p>In this first part, we lay the groundwork for understanding functional programming. We’ll start by introducing the core concepts of functional programming and how they apply to C#. You’ll learn about the crucial distinction between expressions and statements, and how to write more expressive code. We’ll then explore pure functions and how to minimize side effects, which are fundamental to functional programming. Finally, we’ll discuss honest functions and effective ways to handle null values, setting the stage for more robust code design.</p>
