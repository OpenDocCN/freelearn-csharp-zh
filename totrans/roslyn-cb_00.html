<p>Software developers deal with source code on a day-to-day basis. Regardless of the technology or the programming language that they work on, there are a bunch of routine tasks that they must perform on their code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile source code into the runtime-specific binary format</li>
<li>Analyze source code to identify issues in the source code</li>
<li>Edit source code to fix issues or refactor to improve maintenance, understandability, performance, security, and so on</li>
<li>Navigate source code to search patterns, references, definitions, and relationships</li>
<li>Debug source code to observe and fix runtime behavior for functionality, performances, security, and so on</li>
<li>Visualize collections of source components (projects), their properties, configuration, and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>The .NET Compiler Platform (code named <em>Roslyn</em>) is a platform for .NET programming languages, C# and Visual Basic, to enable building tools and extensions to perform these routine programming tasks. Notably, this platform is shared between Microsoft s .NET compilers and the Visual Studio IDE for .NET development.</p>
<p>Roslyn is divided into multiple programming layers, with each layer exposing public APIs to write customized tools and extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CodeAnalysis</strong> layer: Core syntax and semantic representation layer of source code. C# and Visual Basic compilers (<em>csc.exe</em> and <em>vbc.exe</em>) are written on top of this layer.</li>
<li><strong>Workspaces</strong> layer: Project and solution layer that collects a set of logically related source files. These are not coupled to any specific host, such as Visual Studio.</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong> layer: Set of IDE features built on top of the CodeAnalysis and Workspaces API such as code fixes, refactorings, IntelliSense, completion, finding references, and navigating to definition and so on. These are not coupled to any specific host, such as Visual Studio.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio</strong> layer: Visual Studio workspace and project system that brings together and lights up all the compiler and IDE features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Roslyn is essentially a stack of services that has been written with two core design principles: <strong>Extensibility</strong> (for layers above and third-party plugins) and <strong>Maintainability</strong> (it has well-documented and supported public APIs across these layers). External developers or third parties can do bunch of cool stuff on top of these services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write their own tools for any specific programming layer to accomplish any of the programming tasks noted previously.</li>
<li>Write simple plugins (for example diagnostic analyzers, code fixes and refactorings, completion and IntelliSense providers) for specific layers.</li>
<li>Perform advanced scenarios at any specific layer, such as implementing their own compiler, Workspace, IDE, or project system, and all the other functionality across the stack lights up automagically.</li>
</ul>

End users will see these diagnostics on building the project from the command line or Visual Studio and see them live while editing the source code in the Visual Studio IDE.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><a href="8e0229af-657f-4306-96b5-40511d1fe7b2.xhtml" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 2</span></a>, <span class="ItalicsPACKT"><em>Consuming Diagnostic Analyzers in .NET Projects</em>,</span> enables developers in the C# community to harness third-party Roslyn diagnostic analyzers for their C# projects. You will learn how to search, install, view, and configure diagnostic analyzers in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, and user input are shown as follows: "Additionally, the <kbd>.editorconfig</kbd> files can be checked into the repo alongside the sources, so that the rules are enforced for every user that contributes to the repo."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>
 private void Method_PreferBraces(bool flag)<br/>  {<br/>    if (flag)<br/>    {<br/>      Console.WriteLine(flag);<br/>    }<br/>  }    
</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>
<strong>msbuild ClassLibrary.csproj /v:m</strong>
</pre>
<p>New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Start Visual Studio, click <span class="packt_screen">File</span> | <span class="packt_screen">New</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Project</span><span class="packt_screen">...</span>, create a new C# class library project, and replace the code in <kbd>Class1.cs</kbd> with code from the code sample at <kbd>ClassLibrary/Class1.cs</kbd>."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
