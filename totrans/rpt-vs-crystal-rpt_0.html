Crystal Reports is an amazing reporting tool because it is compatible with Visual Studio and other developing tools. Crystal Reports is compatible with a lot of databases and is easy to use. It is a powerful reporting tool and can be used to create any report with the least amount of effort. This book is different from other technical books because it not only describes the tools and features in Crystal Reports and Visual Studio, but also contains a sample application with eight reports. Every report has a new idea and teaches the reader a new tool. The reader not only learns to create reports but also learns how to display these reports in Microsoft Visual Studio applications.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
