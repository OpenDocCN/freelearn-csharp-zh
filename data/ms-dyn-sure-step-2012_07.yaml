- en: The next step in executing the Upgrade Assessment Service is to assess the existing
    solution's configurations and customizations. In this step, the delivery team
    reviews which features of Microsoft Dynamics have been enabled for the customer,
    including which ones have been configured to meet the customer's needs and which
    ones have been customized. This will allow the delivery team to consider the overall
    objectives for the upgrade and determine which of these configurations and customizations
    will need to be ported over to the new solution and which ones should be retired.
    For example, the older version may have necessitated customizations in areas where
    the solution did not have a corresponding functionality. Or perhaps the solution
    needed a specific ISV solution to meet a need. If the current product version
    provides these features as standard functionalities, these customizations or ISV
    solutions would no longer need to be part of the new solution. Data migration
    (if required) from previous versions to the new one must be considered as part
    of this step.

  zh: 执行升级评估服务的下一步是评估现有解决方案的配置和自定义。在此步骤中，交付团队能够审查为客户启用了哪些Microsoft Dynamics功能，包括哪些已配置以满足客户需求，以及哪些已进行自定义。这将使交付团队能够考虑升级的整体目标，并确定哪些配置和自定义需要迁移到新解决方案，哪些应该被淘汰。例如，较旧版本可能需要在解决方案没有相应功能的地方进行自定义。或者，解决方案可能需要特定的ISV解决方案来满足需求。如果当前产品版本提供这些功能作为标准功能，那么这些自定义或ISV解决方案就不再需要成为新解决方案的一部分。必须将数据迁移（如果需要）从旧版本迁移到新版本作为此步骤的一部分考虑。
- en: The next Upgrade Assessment Service step is to examine custom interfaces for
    the existing solution. This includes assessing any custom code written to interface
    the solution with third-party solutions, such as an external database for reporting
    purposes. This step is followed by reviewing the existing infrastructure and architecture
    configuration so that the delivery team can understand the hardware components
    that can be leveraged for the new solution. The delivery team can provide confirmation
    on whether the existing infrastructure can support the upgrade application, or
    whether additional infrastructure components may be necessary.

    of the solution with the new version of the product, or customers who need a complex
    functionality to be enabled as part of the upgrade. In both these cases, the customer
    may request the delivery team to conduct Proof of Concept Services of the solution
    prior to embarking on a full upgrade, in which case the Proof of Concept service
    may be executed. They may also request assistance from the delivery team to assess
    the return on investment for the upgraded solution, in which case the Business

    FRD should clearly note the existing business functions and requirements that
    will be upgraded to the new release and also any additional requirements (in other
    words, a new functionality) to be delivered as part of the upgrade. The Fit Gap

    requirements for data retention, and strategies for warehousing of data external
    to the Microsoft Dynamics solution. Depending on the state of the source date,
    the team may also need to identify whether **Extract Transform and Load** (**ETL**)

    Dynamics解决方案之外的数据存储策略。根据源数据的状态，团队还可能需要确定是否需要**提取、转换和加载**（**ETL**）工具来进行数据清洗和迁移工作。还应确定数据迁移的哪些部分将自动化，哪些部分（如果有的话）需要手动执行。
- en: While the goal of the Analysis phase is to understand the requirements to establish
    the overall scope for the upgrade engagement, the Design phase is used to define
    how the technical upgrade will be implemented. Objectives include planning the
    steps for executing the upgrade and identifying conflicts for upgrading the custom
    code. It also includes proactively planning for potential post-upgrade issues
    and reviewing the existing integration and interfaces between Microsoft Dynamics
    and third-party solutions to determine whether they need to be upgraded to work
    with the newer version of the Microsoft Dynamics solution. Accordingly, the key
    Design phase activities include **Data Upgrade Checklist** for planning and executing
    the upgrade, **Existing Code Review** to analyze and identify any conflicts created
    by customizations to the existing solution, and **Existing Integrations and Interfaces
    Review** to determine which existing integrations and interfaces need to be upgraded.
    If product tools are available to support these activities, links to the corresponding
    tools are referenced in Sure Step. For example, Microsoft Dynamics AX provides
    an upgrade checklist utility with the required and optional steps denoted in a
    sequential manner to provide guidance and assistance during the upgrade process
    as well as a Compare tool for Microsoft Dynamics AX to help determine and resolve
    code conflicts for solution customizations. Microsoft Dynamics AX has a unique
    architecture where the code can be saved in different layers, (such as a USR layer
    for customer users and a VAR layer for partners). The Compare tool also provides
    the ability to compare and detect code conflicts while upgrading one layer at
    a time or simultaneously in all layers.

    Step中会引用相应的工具链接。例如，微软Dynamics AX提供了一个升级清单实用程序，以顺序方式标记了必需和可选步骤，以在升级过程中提供指导和帮助，以及一个用于微软Dynamics
    AX的比较工具，以帮助确定和解决解决方案自定义的代码冲突。微软Dynamics AX具有独特的架构，代码可以保存到不同的层中（例如，USR层用于客户用户，VAR层用于合作伙伴）。比较工具还提供了在升级单个层时或同时在所有层中同时比较和检测代码冲突的能力。

    training could be executed in groups—typically, the delivery team will train key
    users or a core set of users who will then act as trainers for the remaining end
    users. Technical training pertaining to updated technology must also be incorporated
    at this time; examples include updates to SQL Management or Reporting Services

    Acceptance Testing** (**UAT**). UAT is a key validation point by the customer
    organization of the new solution—user acceptance of the solution indicates the

    product- and industry-focused UAT script templates that the delivery teams should
    leverage. These detailed scripts walk the user through the steps for executing

    annual savings. In addition, the company substantially reduced its server infrastructure
    from 110 physical servers to 60 virtual servers running on just five physical

    an upgrade. But when upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 Service Pack 1, we
    only needed to spare a few of our staff and they completed it in three weeks."
