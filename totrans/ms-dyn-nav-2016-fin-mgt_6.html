In this chapter, we will learn the setup options that allow this to happen.</p><p>The topics that we will cover in this chapter are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Posting groups</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Dimensions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Number series</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The general setup</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec45"/>Understanding posting groups</h1></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Posting groups</strong> are the linking bridge between the G/L accounts and the accounts used on all application areas, such as items, customers, vendors, and fixed assets. Posting groups are used to notify the system which accounts to use on each transaction. There are three main types of posting group as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Specific posting groups</strong>: These are used to link subsidiary ledgers (namely the vendor ledger entries) to the general ledger. They are used to specify balance sheet accounts.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>General posting groups</strong>: Typically, these are used to specify income statement accounts that should be used on transactions. They are used to specify to whom and what we sell or buy.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>TAX posting groups</strong>: You use these to specify the tax rates, calculation types, and accounts.</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec63"/>Specific posting groups</h2></div></div></div><p>Specific posting groups are mainly used to instruct the system about which balance sheet account to use for each subsidiary ledger. For example, the sum of balances of all customers must be equal to the balances of the accounts receivable in the balance sheet.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note34"/>Note</h3><p>To avoid differences between general and subsidiary ledgers, balance accounts used on posting groups are usually set up to disallow direct posting.</p></div></div><p>In Dynamics NAV, you can find the following specific posting groups:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>
<p>
<strong>Posting Group name</strong>
</p>
</td><td>
<p>
<strong>Description</strong>
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>
<strong>Customer Posting Groups</strong>
</p>
</td><td>
<p>This specifies the accounts for transaction such as receivables, payment discounts, roundings, and interest and fees that relate to customers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>
<strong>Vendor Posting Groups</strong>
</p>
</td><td>
<p>This maps payable accounts, payment discount amounts, rounding accounts, and interest and fee accounts that relate to vendors.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>
<strong>Inventory Posting Group</strong>/<strong>Inventory Posting Setup</strong>
</p>
</td><td>

<p>This maps inventory accounts, WIP accounts, and other accounts that relate to the inventory.</p>
<p>Inventory posting groups define the type of inventory, while accounts are specified in the <strong>Inventory Posting Setup</strong> page in combination with locations.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>
<strong>Bank Account Posting Groups</strong>
</p>
</td><td>
<p>This links a bank G/L account to a bank account.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>Fixed asset posting groups</p>
</td><td>
<p>This specifies the accounts used in FA transactions such as posting its acquisition cost, or depreciation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>
<strong>Job Posting Groups</strong>
</p>
</td><td>
<p>This maps the accounts used in transactions involving jobs.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>To access each posting group, type its name in the search box and select the corresponding link. The following screenshot shows the customer posting groups defined in the <strong>CRONUS</strong> International Ltd. demo company:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_06_01.jpg" alt="Specific posting groups"/></div><p>
</p><p>As an example, when you post an invoice, a customer ledger is created and the account specified in the <strong>Receivables Account</strong> field is used to post the corresponding amount in the general ledger.</p><p>Specific posting groups are assigned to its corresponding cards in fields that have the same name. In <strong>Customer Card</strong>, for instance, you find a field called <strong>Customer Posting Groups</strong>, where you can assign one of the defined posting groups to each customer, in the same manner you find the <strong>Bank Acc. Posting Group</strong> field in the bank account card or the <strong>FA Posting Group</strong> field in the depreciation book lines of the FA card.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec64"/>General posting groups</h2></div></div></div><p>The main purpose of general posting groups is to bind subsidiary ledgers to income statement accounts. There are two different general posting groups, as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>General Business Posting Groups</strong>: This specifies who we are selling to and who are we buying from. You need to specify them on Customers, Vendors, and, in some occasions, G/L accounts.</li></ul></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note35"/>Note</h3><p>G/L accounts require a business posting group if they are used in a transaction that requires VAT calculation.</p></div></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>General Product Posting Groups</strong>: They specify what is being sold or purchased. They are assigned to <strong>Items</strong>, <strong>Resources</strong>, <strong>G/L Accounts</strong>, and <strong>Item Charges</strong>.</li></ul></div><p>As a general rule, create as many business groups as needed to analyze sales by customers or purchases by vendors. Also, consider how many product groups are needed to analyze sales and purchases by products. As a rule, you create one general product posting group for each major product group reflected in the chart of accounts.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Application Setup</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Posting Groups</strong> to access both posting groups.</p><p>Take a look at the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_06_02.jpg" alt="General posting groups"/></div><p>
</p><p>So far, we have defined groups, but we have not assigned them to G/L accounts. It is the mixture of a business and a product group that will define the account to be used. The following screenshot shows the general posting setup used in the <strong>CRONUS</strong> company:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_06_03.jpg" alt="General posting groups"/></div><p>
</p><p>As an example, when you post an invoice with a customer in the <strong>EXPORT</strong> group and an item in the <strong>MANUFACT</strong> group, the account <strong>6130</strong> is used to post the corresponding amount in the general ledger, as specified in the <strong>Sales Account</strong> field.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec65"/>Tax posting groups</h2></div></div></div><p>Tax posting groups are used by the system to know how tax is to be calculated and posted, depending on who the item is sold to or purchased from and what is sold or purchased. Just like general posting groups, to define tax you need to create the following posting groups:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Tax business posting groups that are assigned to customers and vendors</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Tax product posting groups that are assigned to items and resources</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Combinations of both are specified on the <strong>TAX Posting Setup</strong> page</li></ul></div><p>In the earlier versions of Dynamics NAV 2016, the <strong>TAX Posting Group</strong> was known as the <strong>VAT Posting Group</strong>.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the <strong>TAX Posting Setup</strong> page for the export business group:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_06_04.jpg" alt="Tax posting groups"/></div><p>
</p><p>For each combination, you need to specify <strong>TAX %</strong>, <strong>TAX Calculation Type</strong>, and the general ledger accounts to use on sales and purchases. The accounts to use for unrealized VAT or to adjust VAT for payment discounts can be specified in additional fields.</p><p>You can select one of the following options for <strong>TAX Calculation Type</strong>:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Normal</strong>: This option is used to calculate VAT.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Reverse charge</strong>: This option is used when doing business with other countries in the EU where the purchaser must calculate and settle VAT accounts with the tax authorities.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Full VAT</strong>: This option is used when the entire amount is considered VAT.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>No taxable VAT</strong>: When this option is selected, the system does not generate any VAT ledger entry. It is useful for concepts that are not subject to VAT.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Sales tax</strong>: This option is used only if the program has to calculate US sales tax instead of VAT.</li></ul></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec46"/>Setting up dimensions</h1></div></div></div><p>In <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Reporting and Business Intelligence">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Reporting and Business Intelligence</em>, you learned about dimensions and how they can help to analyze the data registered into the system. To create dimensions and dimensions values, we perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Dimensions</strong> and click on <strong>New</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Give the new dimension a code such as <code class="literal">ITEM TYPE</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Dimension Values</strong> and create the values shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_06_05.jpg" alt="Setting up dimensions"/></div><p>
</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note36"/>Note</h3><p>You can create new dimension values on existing dimensions at any time.</p></div></div></li></ol></div><p>Once the dimension is created, we have to tell the system whether it will be used as a global dimension or a shortcut dimension. This can be done in the <strong>General Ledger Setup</strong> window.</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Setup</strong> | <strong>General Ledger Setup</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">In the <strong>Dimensions</strong> tab, select the <strong>ITEM TYPE</strong> dimension in the <strong>Shortcut Dimension 7 code</strong> field.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip37"/>Tip</h3><p>Change global dimensions
Once the global dimensions are assigned, you can change them using the <strong>Change Global Dimensions</strong> job found on the ribbon bar.</p></div></div></li></ol></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec47"/>Number series</h1></div></div></div><p>In Dynamics NAV, every document, transaction, or card (such as a customer or vendor card) must have a unique identification number by which it can be organized and tracked. To let the system help you with this, you can set up a number series performing the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Number Series</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>New</strong>. Give the new number series a code, such as <code class="literal">MY CUST</code>, and a description, such as <code class="literal">My Customers</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Check the <strong>Default Nos.</strong> field and the <strong>Manual Nos.</strong> field. This way, you can either use automatic or manual numbering with the number series.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note38"/>Note</h3><p>If you need to check whether numbers are assigned chronologically, check the <strong>Date Order</strong> field.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Lines</strong> option from the ribbon bar and create the following line:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_06_06.jpg" alt="Number series"/></div><p>
</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note39"/>Note</h3><p>If you need to use a new number every month or every year, create as many lines as needed, indicating the starting date on each of them.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">To instruct the system to use these new number series when creating new customers, navigate to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Receivables</strong> | <strong>Setup</strong> | <strong>Sales &amp; Receivables Setup</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">On the <strong>Numbering</strong> tab, select the <strong>MY CUST</strong> series in the <strong>Customer Nos.</strong> field.</li><li class="listitem">Create a new customer to verify that the new series is being used.</li></ol></div><p>Most setup pages contain a tab called <strong>Numbering</strong> where you can instruct the system about which series to use on each document, card, or transaction.</p><p>Number series can also be assigned to journal batches so that a correlative number is assigned every time you create or post new lines. The following screenshot shows the batches in the general journal. To assign a number when creating new journal lines, select a series in the <strong>No. Series</strong> field. If you select a series in the <strong>Posting No. Series</strong> option, the number will be assigned when posting the transaction, not when creating the line:</p><p>

</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec48"/>General setup</h1></div></div></div><p>Every Dynamics NAV functional area has its own setup options that will determine the behavior of the application on that area. We will take a look at the setup of the functional areas we have seen in this book: General ledger, Sales, Purchases, and Inventory.</p><p>Most of the available setup options can be found via the following path: <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Application Setup</strong> | <strong>Financial Management</strong> | <strong>Finance</strong>, and you can choose among the different setups available.</p><p>The <strong>General Ledger Setup</strong> page is shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05733_06_08.jpg" alt="General setup"/></div><p>
</p><p>The <strong>General Ledger Setup</strong> page allows you to determine general behaviors that will be used throughout the whole application. As an example, we have identified four setup groups, as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Allowed posting dates</strong>: We have explained the usage of this setup in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Accounting Processes">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Accounting Processes</em>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Address format</strong>: Different countries type address information in different orders. Here, you specify how addresses will be written on printed documents, such as invoices.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>VAT setup</strong>: With these options, you can determine different VAT calculation behaviors, such as rounding.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Payment tolerance</strong>: If you have an invoice with an amount of <strong>1001, 53</strong> and you receive a payment of <strong>1,000</strong>, you may consider that the invoice has been paid. If you don't want that amount of <strong>1, 53</strong> to be pending forever, payment tolerance should be set up.</li></ul></div><p>There are other setup options in the general ledger. On the <strong>Dimensions</strong> FastTab, the general dimensions are established, and on the <strong>Numbering</strong> FastTab, you specify which number series will be used for banks.</p><p>The <strong>Sales &amp; Receivables Setup</strong> page and the <strong>Purchases &amp; Payables Setup</strong> page are very similar and you can use them to specify the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The numbering to be used for the master data (customer and vendors) and for the different documents</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to post discounts to the general ledger, together with the invoice amount or separately to be able to see the discounts on the general ledger</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The default posting date and default quantities to post on documents</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Whether external document numbers are mandatory</li></ul></div><p>The <strong>Inventory Setup</strong> page can be found by navigating to <strong>Departments</strong> | <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Application Setup</strong> | <strong>Warehouse</strong> | <strong>Inventory</strong> and can be used to specify the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The numbering to be used for master data (items) and for different warehouse-specific documents</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Whether item costs should be automatically posted to the general ledger or not</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to calculate an item's average cost</li></ul></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec49"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we saw what posting groups are and how they are used in the application to post multiple accounting transactions with no accounting knowledge needed. We have also seen other important setups such as the dimensions or the number series. All these configurations are vital for the application to work the way we want.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will see brief explanations of other areas that can be managed in Dynamics NAV regarding financial management.</p></div></body></html>
